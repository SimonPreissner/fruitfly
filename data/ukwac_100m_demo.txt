the
ringing
of
the
shilling
.
people
make
their
plans
in
cold
blood
and
forget
all
about
them
when
the
blood
grows
hot
.
it
was
so
here
.
west
had
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
while
cool
,
but
acted
just
in
the
fashion
he
had
cried
out
against
to
his
companion
.
for
as
soon
as
anson
lounged
up
to
them
in
his
supercilious
jaunty
way
,
west
's
cool
blood
warmed
,
grew
hot
at
the
scoundrel
's
contemptuous
look
of
triumph
,
and
at
the
insult
respecting
the
boers
boiled
over
.
"
how
dare
you
!
"
he
raged
out
.
"
keep
your
distance
,
you
contemptible
cur
,
or
,
prisoner
though
i
am
,
i
'll
give
you
such
a
thrashing
as
shall
make
you
yell
for
mercy
!
"
"
hullo
!
what
does
this
mean
?
"
said
one
of
the
boer
officers
,
closing
up
,
followed
by
the
others
.
"
the
prisoner
is
a
bit
saucy
!
"
said
anson
contemptuously
.
"
you
did
not
bleed
him
enough
!
"
"
you
know
these
two
?
"
asked
the
officer
.
"
well
,
in
a
way
,
"
said
anson
,
in
a
haughty
,
indifferent
tone
.
"
they
were
a
pair
of
underlings
where
i
was
engaged
at
the
diamond
-
mines
.
insolent
bullying
fellows
,
both
of
them
!
but
you
'll
tame
them
down
.
"
the
boer
leader
nodded
.
"
a
bit
sore
at
being
taken
prisoners
!
"
he
said
.
"
no
,
"
cried
west
;
"
it
is
the
fortune
of
war
,
sir
.
we
are
englishmen
,
and
we
made
a
dash
to
escape
kimberley
,
and
got
through
your
investing
lines
.
"
"
to
carry
despatches
to
the
rooineks
?
"
"
no
,
"
replied
west
.
"
your
men
searched
us
and
found
no
despatches
.
"
"
messages
then
.
you
were
going
to
the
british
forces
?
"
"
we
should
have
joined
them
after
a
time
,
perhaps
,
"
said
west
,
speaking
more
coolly
.
"
he
's
lying
!
"
said
anson
sharply
.
"
have
them
searched
again
!
"
the
boer
commandant
nodded
,
gave
the
order
,
and
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
his
men
came
forward
,
after
which
the
prisoners
were
ordered
out
of
the
wagon
,
and
they
let
themselves
down
,
when
they
were
thoroughly
searched
from
head
to
heel
--
of
course
,
without
result
,
and
the
boer
chief
turned
frowningly
to
anson
.
"
they
must
have
hid
the
letter
somewhere
about
the
wagon
then
!
"
"
two
of
you
get
in
and
search
!
"
said
the
commandant
.
this
was
carefully
carried
out
,
and
the
men
descended
.
"
then
they
must
have
destroyed
their
message
before
you
took
them
,
"
cried
anson
,
"
or
somehow
since
.
"
"
they
were
carefully
searched
as
soon
as
they
were
taken
,
"
observed
one
of
the
field
-
cornets
.
"
yes
,
"
said
the
commandant
,
"
and
i
saw
it
done
.
well
,
they
will
not
carry
any
news
to
mafeking
.
tell
them
that
the
british
are
being
swept
into
the
sea
east
and
south
,
and
their
rule
is
at
an
end
.
i
want
brave
men
who
can
ride
and
fight
,
so
if
they
like
to
join
the
federal
forces
and
do
their
duty
there
will
be
a
prosperous
time
for
them
.
if
they
refuse
there
will
be
a
long
imprisonment
,
perhaps
something
worse
.
"
"
mr.
anson
,
the
renegade
,
need
not
trouble
himself
,
sir
,
"
said
west
quietly
.
"
neither
my
companion
nor
i
will
do
as
he
has
done
.
"
"
you
had
better
!
"
said
anson
sneeringly
.
"
it
's
a
grand
chance
for
you
now
your
characters
are
gone
and
the
i.d.
detectives
are
after
you
.
"
ingleborough
looked
at
the
speaker
sharply
;
but
anson
made
believe
not
to
notice
it
and
went
on
.
"
you
've
no
character
now
,
either
of
you
,
"
he
continued
coolly
.
"
old
norton
came
after
me
as
i
was
trekking
south
,
utterly
sick
of
the
english
lot
.
he
came
on
the
old
pretext
:
that
i
had
bought
diamonds
and
was
carrying
them
off
.
he
searched
again
,
and
then
i
told
him
the
simple
truth
--
that
you
two
had
volunteered
to
carry
despatches
so
as
to
get
clear
off
with
the
swag
you
had
acquired
--
after
accusing
me
;
but
he
professed
not
to
believe
me
,
and
took
me
back
to
kimberley
,
but
the
very
next
day
he
started
off
with
half
-
a
-
dozen
men
to
fetch
you
back
,
and
i
came
away
.
"
"
with
the
diamonds
you
had
hidden
?
"
said
ingleborough
sharply
.
"
perhaps
,
"
replied
anson
coolly
.
"
so
,
you
see
,
you
had
better
join
our
party
,
for
even
if
you
escaped
it
would
only
be
for
the
police
superintendent
to
get
hold
of
you
both
,
and
if
he
did
,
you
would
n't
find
him
such
an
excellent
friend
.
"
"
wants
thinking
about
!
"
said
ingleborough
drily
.
"
but
'
our
'
party--'our
'
?
"
"
yes
,
"
said
anson
coolly
.
"
i
've
made
up
my
mind
to
belong
to
the
right
owners
of
the
country
for
a
long
time
past
.
we
've
got
the
gold
at
johannesburg
,
and
the
diamonds
at
kimberley
are
ours
by
right
,
and
