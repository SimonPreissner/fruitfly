_ a dash from diamond city george manville fenn | next chapter | | previous chapter | | contents | chapter xviii . the ringing of the shilling . people make their plans in cold blood and forget all about them when the blood grows hot . it was so here . west had made up his mind what to do while cool , but acted just in the fashion he had cried out against to his companion . for as soon as anson lounged up to them in his supercilious jaunty way , west 's cool blood warmed , grew hot at the scoundrel 's contemptuous look of triumph , and at the insult respecting the boers boiled over . " how dare you ! " he raged out . " keep your distance , you contemptible cur , or , prisoner though i am , i 'll give you such a thrashing as shall make you yell for mercy ! " " hullo ! what does this mean ? " said one of the boer officers , closing up , followed by the others . " the prisoner is a bit saucy ! " said anson contemptuously . " you did not bleed him enough ! " " you know these two ? " asked the officer . " well , in a way , " said anson , in a haughty , indifferent tone . " they were a pair of underlings where i was engaged at the diamond - mines . insolent bullying fellows , both of them ! but you 'll tame them down . " the boer leader nodded . " a bit sore at being taken prisoners ! " he said . " no , " cried west ; " it is the fortune of war , sir . we are englishmen , and we made a dash to escape kimberley , and got through your investing lines . " " to carry despatches to the rooineks ? " " no , " replied west . " your men searched us and found no despatches . " " messages then . you were going to the british forces ? " " we should have joined them after a time , perhaps , " said west , speaking more coolly . " he 's lying ! " said anson sharply . " have them searched again ! " the boer commandant nodded , gave the order , and half - a - dozen of his men came forward , after which the prisoners were ordered out of the wagon , and they let themselves down , when they were thoroughly searched from head to heel -- of course , without result , and the boer chief turned frowningly to anson . " they must have hid the letter somewhere about the wagon then ! " " two of you get in and search ! " said the commandant . this was carefully carried out , and the men descended . " then they must have destroyed their message before you took them , " cried anson , " or somehow since . " " they were carefully searched as soon as they were taken , " observed one of the field - cornets . " yes , " said the commandant , " and i saw it done . well , they will not carry any news to mafeking . tell them that the british are being swept into the sea east and south , and their rule is at an end . i want brave men who can ride and fight , so if they like to join the federal forces and do their duty there will be a prosperous time for them . if they refuse there will be a long imprisonment , perhaps something worse . " " mr. anson , the renegade , need not trouble himself , sir , " said west quietly . " neither my companion nor i will do as he has done . " " you had better ! " said anson sneeringly . " it 's a grand chance for you now your characters are gone and the i.d. detectives are after you . " ingleborough looked at the speaker sharply ; but anson made believe not to notice it and went on . " you 've no character now , either of you , " he continued coolly . " old norton came after me as i was trekking south , utterly sick of the english lot . he came on the old pretext : that i had bought diamonds and was carrying them off . he searched again , and then i told him the simple truth -- that you two had volunteered to carry despatches so as to get clear off with the swag you had acquired -- after accusing me ; but he professed not to believe me , and took me back to kimberley , but the very next day he started off with half - a - dozen men to fetch you back , and i came away . " " with the diamonds you had hidden ? " said ingleborough sharply . " perhaps , " replied anson coolly . " so , you see , you had better join our party , for even if you escaped it would only be for the police superintendent to get hold of you both , and if he did , you would n't find him such an excellent friend . " " wants thinking about ! " said ingleborough drily . " but ' our ' party--'our ' ? " " yes , " said anson coolly . " i 've made up my mind to belong to the right owners of the country for a long time past . we 've got the gold at johannesburg , and the diamonds at kimberley are ours by right , and we 're going to have them . " there was a murmur of satisfaction from the boers at this , and anson went on nonchalantly : " that is one reason why i consented to serve the company in such a beggarly position . i wanted to learn all i could about the mining so that it might come in useful when we of the boer party took possession . " " and then , i suppose , " said ingleborough , " you 'll expect to be manager - in - chief ? " " well , i do n't go so far as that , " said anson ; " but , with my knowledge of the management of the mining business , i feel sure my boer friends will find it to their advantage to retain me high up on the staff . you see , there are so many things in the way of checking losses which i have mastered . " " stopping the illicit - diamond - buying and selling , for instance , " said ingleborough sarcastically . " exactly ! " replied anson , apparently without noticing the sarcasm ; " and i 've been thinking that no doubt i could put a good thing in both your ways . of course , we have been bad enough friends ; but i 'll pass over all that if you 'll serve me as faithfully as you did the company . what do you say ? " " say ? " cried west . " stop ! hold hard , oliver ! " cried ingleborough , stopping him short ; " this is a thing that ca n't be settled in a minute . we want time . all i say now , mr. anson , is that i 'm glad we bear such a good character , seeing that we are illicit - diamond - dealers escaping with the plunder that we have n't got . " " exactly ! " said anson . " very well , then , i 'll give you till to - morrow night to think it over , and you 'll soon see which side your bread 's buttered . " " do n't stop me , ingle , " said west hotly . " i ca n't stand this . i must speak . this-- " a sharp report from behind the wagon checked further words , and every man made a rush for this place or that in full expectation that a sudden attack had been made upon the laager within the rocky walls . at the same moment a kaffir of the blackest type and with his hair greased up into the familiar zulu ring bounded into sight , tripped , fell upon his hands , sprang up again , ran on , and disappeared , whilst a rush was made for the man who fired , leaving anson and the prisoners together . the next minute west 's blood felt as if it was running cold in his veins as he saw , only a few yards from him and close to the stone upon which his jacket had been stretched , the sentry slowly re - loading his pistol . but the coat was gone . west had hard work to repress a groan . " my orders were to fire at anyone i saw stealing , " said the man surlily , and west heard every word . " well , who was stealing ? " asked one of the officers . " a kaffir , " replied the sentry . " i 'd got a jacket stretched out upon the stones yonder , to get aired in the sunshine , and i only took my eyes off it for a minute , when i saw a foot rise up from behind a stone , grab hold of the coat with its toes-- " " nonsense ! " cried the officer ; " a foot could not do that ! " " not do it ? " said the man excitedly . " it had to do it ; and it was creeping away , when i fired , and the black sprang up and ran . " " where 's the jacket ? " the officer 's question woke an echo in west 's breast , and he started , for it was just as if the question was repeated there , and it seemed to be echoed so loudly that he fancied those near must have heard it . " he 's got it , i suppose , " said the sentry coolly . " carried it away , and a bullet too somewhere in his carcass . " a miserably despondent feeling attacked west at these words , for he had clung to the hope that he might be able to recover the despatch , succeed in escaping and delivering it in safety , however late ; while now the desire to get away died out , for how could he return to kimberley and confess that he had failed ? he turned to glance at ingleborough , who met his eyes and then shrugged his shoulders as much as to say : " it 's a bad job , and i pity you . " at that moment a hand was clapped heavily upon west 's shoulder , and the boer who had saluted him so roughly pointed to the wagon , and he saw that his companion was being treated in the same way , while , the scare being over , upon their walking back and preparing to climb in , they were called upon to stop . naturally the prisoners obeyed , and , turning , they found the group of boers in earnest conversation once more with anson , who at the end of a few minutes nodded decisively and approached his two old fellow - clerks , making west 's heart begin to thump with excitement and his eyes gleam , for the despair he felt at the loss he had sustained made him ready to turn fiercely upon the first enemy who addressed him . " take it calmly ! " whispered ingleborough . " let me diplomatise . you 'll do no good by making a row . " " take it calmly ! " whispered back west , " and at a time like this ! i ca n't ! " " look here , you two , " said anson coolly . " let 's have no more bones about the matter . these gentlemen say they have too much to think about to bother over any shilly - shallying on the part of a couple of prisoners . you know it 's a good chance , and i 've told them you 'll both join along with me . just tell them out and out you will . " " you miserable renegade , how dare you ! " cried west fiercely . " here , what does that mean ? " cried the boer commandant sharply . " shamming ! " replied anson , with a contemptuous laugh . " they 're going to join us , knowing , as they do , that the game is all up at kimberley ; but they put on all this make - believe . they want to be able to say that they were forced to serve , so as to hedge -- so as to make it all comfortable with their consciences , as they call them . " " it is false ! " cried west furiously--"a tissue of lies ! do n't believe him ; this man is no better than a miserable contemptible thief ! " " what ! " shouted anson , lowering the rifle he carried and taking a step forward with what was intended to be a fierce aspect . but he only took one step , being checked suddenly by the action of west , who , regardless of the weapon , sprang at him , and would have wrenched away the rifle had he not been seized by a couple of the boers , who held him fast . " pooh ! i do n't want to shoot the wretched cad ! " said anson contemptuously . " an old fellow - clerk of mine ! he 's savage and jealous of my position here ! he always was an ill - tempered brute ! " " but he says that you are a thief ! " said the boer commandant sternly . " pooh ! a spiteful man would say anything ! " cried anson contemptuously . " look here , sir , i 've watched the boer troubles from the first : i 've seen how the english have been trying to find an excuse for seizing the two republics : i know how they got possession of the great diamond - mines by a trick arranged with the surveyors of the boundaries . " there was a low murmur of assent here from the gathering crowd of boers who had now surrounded him . " yes , " he said , raising his voice , " i knew all the iniquities of the british government -- how the english had seized the diamond - fields , and how they were trying to get the gold - mines , and as soon as the war broke out i made up my mind to join the people fighting for their liberty . " there was a burst of cheering from the few who could follow the speaker , and then a roar as soon as his words were explained to the crowd , while anson looked round with his fat face growing shiny , as he beamed upon his hearers . " yes , " said the boer leader coldly ; " but this young man , who knows you , charges you with being a thief . " " all cowardly malice ! " cried anson contemptuously , and giving his fingers a snap . " a thief ?-- a robber ?-- nonsense . pooh ! i only dealt in and brought away with me a few of the stones , which were as much mine as theirs . i was not coming away from the enemy empty - handed . i said to myself that i 'd spoil the egyptians as much as i could , and i did . " there was a shout of delight at this , and one of the field - cornets gave the speaker a hearty slap on the shoulder . " yes , i brought some away , " continued anson , rejoicing fatly in the success of his words ; and , raising his voice , he said , first in english and then in boer - dutch : " i brought some away , and i wish i had brought more . " there was a fresh and a long - continued roar of delight , repeated again and again , giving the speaker time to collect his thoughts , and as soon as he could gain silence he continued . " look here , " he said : " i came and joined the boers because i believed their cause to be just ; and i said to myself , knowing what i do of the secrets of the diamond - mines , i will be the first as soon as kimberley is taken to show the commandants where the british tyrants have hidden away the stones that belong of right to the boers , the stones that have been stolen from the earth -- the land they fought for and won with their blood from the savage black scum who infested the country . i know where the stones are hidden away , and i can , if you like , lead you to what the british think you will never find . but if you are going to believe the words of this malicious boy , and consider me to be a common thief , i 've done . you can have the few paltry stones i brought away to sell and pay for my bread and meat till the war is over , and let me go . i do n't want to act as your guide into kimberley ! it 's nothing to me ! i have told you what i did ; and what is more , i 'd do it again ! " " yes , " said ingleborough , in a whisper to west , as he sat holding his hand to his injured head : " i believe him there . " west nodded , and the next minute they saw anson being led away in triumph by a crowd of boers ; but the commandant , with half - a - dozen more who seemed to be officers , and the man who had defended them when they were captured , remained close by the prisoners , talking together . soon after , the commandant approached them , glanced at ingleborough , who lay back , evidently in pain , and then turned to west : " you heard what your old friend said ? " " yes , " replied west . " it is all true ? " " his base confession is , " said west boldly . " the man is a detected illicit - diamond - dealer . " " he only bought what the british wrongly claimed ! " said the boer warmly . " what right had they to make laws forbidding people to buy what was freely given up by the earth for the benefit of all ? " " it is of no use for me to argue about the matter ! " said west coolly . " i shall never convince you , and you will never convince me . " " oh yes , i should , after you had come to your senses ! there , we are not brutes , only men fighting for our liberties , and i like you , for you are brave and manly . why not join our cause ? it is just . " west looked the boer full in the eyes , thinking the while that the man spoke in all sincerity and belief that his cause was right . " well , what do you say ? " cried the boer . west tightened his lips and shook his head . the boer frowned and turned to ingleborough . " well , " he said , " you join us , and you will not repent . prove faithful , and you will gain a place of trust among us ! " west listened for his comrade 's reply . " oh , i ca n't join without him , " said ingleborough . " he 's master , and i 'm only man ! " " then he was bearer of the despatch -- what that man anson said was true ? " " oh yes , that part of his story was true enough . " " that you were despatch - riders on the way to mafeking -- you two ? " " quite right . " " and you two had been diamond - dealers , and brought away a quantity ? " " just as many , as we schoolboys used to say , as you could put in your eye with the point of a needle . all a lie ! anson was putting his own case . all we brought away was the despatch . " " then where is it ? " said the boer sharply . " i do n't know ; i was not the bearer , " said ingleborough quietly , " but you know where it is now ? " " i -- do -- not , " said ingleborough firmly . " i have not the slightest idea where it is ! " " then you have sent it on by someone else ? " " no , " said ingleborough . " there , you know that we have failed , and if you set us at liberty , all we can do is to go back to kimberley and say what has happened . " " you will not go back to kimberley , " said the boer , speaking with his eyes half - closed , " and if you did it would only be to go into prison , for the diamond city is closely besieged , and if not already taken it will in a few days be ours . there , go back to your wagon , and spend the time in thinking till i send for you again . the choice is before you -- a good position with us , or a long imprisonment before you are turned out of the country . " he pointed towards their temporary place of confinement , and then turned away , while a couple of the boers marched them to the wagon and left them in the sentry 's charge . | next chapter | | previous chapter | | contents | e - books created from nineteenth century or early twentieth century texts by athelstane e - texts ._. _ _ advantages member - orientated sevice , the reviews may appear professional and are simple to format , it 's free and is equiped with a greater and more advanced rewards program disadvantages mico transferred :p summary : full review background : i am a relative newbie to consumer - based review sites . formerly . i was involved with writing for online magazines ; one was a journal - type and the other reviewed mp3 's . i preferred writing reviews . however , i was totally uninspired by the content of mediocre mp3 submissions and became bored . writing is my creative release . without having a source for that , i have similar symptoms of becoming lester burnham ( kevin spacey 's role in american beauty ) . my career in government is 100 % technical . i have a wife and child in suburban hell . without this function , my life strongly resembles ground hog 's day ( bill murray vehicle , in which he wakes up to yesterday ) . as a result of looking for a new site to work with , i stumbled across consumer - based opinions on product . wow ! i could write reviews on everything that i want and receive a quick response . at work , i could write and access the site during my break time and also due this during my disposal time . yes , i may have something fresh to look forward to , except these sites tend to pay their reviewers . at work , we have an it policy prohibiting us from being paid for work while using their resources to do so . as i looked for a loophole , i stumbled onto dooyoo . dooyoo indicated clearly in their faq that they only pay reviewers living in the uk i live in the u.s. ;) loophole found and i could access this from work ( during breaks of course : d ) . as a member of dooyoo , i saw a mass number of normally unacceptable faults with their formatting . there are no enhancements ; a reviewer can not bold or italicize his / her text . when uploading a submission , quotes become question marks and lines are split up all over . as a result , a member needs to return to his / her review and adjust these manually . to emphasize this , i will not edit the format at all in this review . dooyoo certainly has its benefits . there is traffic , a related message board , text message center and a sense of community . other reviewers understand that a re ad of their work shou ld receive an honest one in response . katie , the dooyoo team liaison , will respond kindly to your suggestions and relevant emails . lastly ( but not least ) , my rewards could be donated to charity . i was willing to accept this site because at the time , the positive outweighed the negative . there was a point at when i nearly broke and that is when i realized my concept could not be implemented due to the current database and unwillingness to amend it . i wanted to write a novella length series of relevant reviews of elvis with frequent individual updates showing my new work . i tried to write a 2nd review in an elvis in general section and it would not let me upload . if added , i could only modify my 1st review . frustrated , i looked around and saw another ' elvis in general ' listing . since it was not clearly highlighted , i assumed that this was a generic / undefined elvis category . once i submitted it on ( thursday ) , i found out immediately that it was solely intended for the elvis official internet site . i felt stupid because i could not deleted the submission . quickly , i commented on the entry that it was my fault and it was a ' stupid error ' and e - mailed katie . i noticed the guide , ( the ) , gave it a not useful at all rating ( my only such rating ) and commented about it . through a few emails , we both understood each other and requested a transfer and/or a removal of the original piece . at the time of this writing , it has yet to be removed . during all of that hassle , i understood that if there was not small technical update to the database , that i could not create my ' opus ' . my only longstanding and specific goal that i have not reached was actually creating a book . on my own , i attempted to do this , but with no luck . with some feedback after every 1,000 - 1,500 words written , i knew that i coul d be pushe d int o rea ching this goal . however , it was reported that the database is as the dat abase is , so my options di mmed . i looked for input and support . i was not going to give up on what i thought was a reasonable request without a fight . while writing for this site , the sense of community with reviewing peers made it something that i did not wish to give up . my final straw was noticing that none of my reportedly nominated reviews were crowned . right before that realization , i was completely willing to update my current section until i could not do it any further . these updates would not appear as new reviews ( although they were ) on dooyoo and only bumped up my present list of reviews . this means that i either have to review someone , a reviewer wants to read an general elvis or a person to actually look for my page in order to get any feedback . i knew that the chances were slim , but i could get maybe 10 reads by reviewers per update . then i realized that these reviews if read by one member would not be considered a new read and no reward points would be had . still , i was able to struggle through that because i did not have any options at the time . back to the crowns ... i had three well - received reviews that i felt were crown - worthy that week ( based on prior crowns and their faq about crown - worthiness ) . two of my reviews dealt with brand new and highly anticipated album releases and another dealt with a movie that i felt was an extremely creative and effective review ( along with other reviews ) . they were passed over for some that could barely spell his / her name . it offended me . my mind was made up , i was going to find a new avenue and if not , be so intolerable that i would be banned from the site . onward to you u - rate - it ( finally ) : for the next day , i did just that . fortunately , i stumbled onto a new site . this site is u-rate-it.com . i read reviews of it here . i knew that it w as new , un establishe d , had a s ingle owne r and poor design . since i read that there was a one kind support person/ administrator ( james ) , i thought that i could convince him to do this on a trial basis . there was no need , he immediately responded and bashfully pointed me into that direction . he was bashful because it was not an exact match , but i was gleeful because it was close enough . as i read the faq and reviews , it was obvious that he was hands on and cared . it was not corporate at all . i did not feel like i was a peon being corresponded to on a superficial and degrading level . when you are on his site , it seems that you 're immediately on his team , which is comforting . graphically , the front page is far more advanced in appearance than dooyoo and there are n't those annoying pop - ups that disrupt your page loading time . flipping through u - rate - it with my cable modem is a breeze . the profile page on dooyoo is better with its isolated feel , but u - rate - provides all of the options as that page as well . both pages have a homepage , picture upload , reward list , reward tokens to date , friend lists and recent reviews links . u - rate - it excels in its approach to the reviewer . when bringing your review up , you have a number of special formatting options . all you need to make a section bold is to surround the text with [ b ] and [ /b ] and the same applies for italics . there are many emoticons to use to help spruce up your review as well . also , i never had any trouble with my lines splitting up . just load it up and your edits are minimal to none . as a review is submitted , there are three options as to what level of originality that your review is to the site . an exclusive review means that it is piece specifically designated for u - rate - it . revised for you rate it is defined by posting the same review on another source , but is spruced up a little or a lot for the site . the final option is no and that is whe n you copy a re view from one s ite to another . the 1st two op tions are revealed on the review and the ' cut and paste ' variety does has no such designation . for this writer , the system makes me want to creat e reviews only designated for u - rate - it . the most practical system advantage is the ability to create new topics for your review at u - rate - it . at dooyoo , you have to beg and plead without results . here , they have the resources to make it happen and the ability to fix if placed in error . the combined end result is a personal review with a professional appearance . as i look back on my work with dooyoo , i notice that i spent so much time on the formatting that my writing did not meet my standards for several of my reviews . mico , get to the rewards ! okay , since i can not explain the rewards better than the site , i cut / paste ( my only cut and paste ) the relevant information in that section of the faq . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * " do i get paid for submitting reviews ? we like to thank our reviewers with draw entries into one of a number of regular draws and by paying for high quality reviews in certain categories . how do i enter the draws ? at u -

' the qaa feel that such explicitness supports confidence in and understanding about he . the qaa state very clearly that the framework is not intended to establish a straightjacket for he qualifications and the diversity of awards should not be inhibited by its introduction . the qaa make clear that academic reviewers will make judgements about whether or not an institution is working within the framework and report accordingly . the framework provides one of a number of reference points ( including benchmark statements , programme specifications and progress files ) that will assist reviewers in making judgements about the standards of provision . however , it is for institutions to decide how the outcomes they have defined for their programmes align with the framework . qualification descriptors the primary reference point for qualifications will be the qualification descriptor . these descriptors will exemplify the characteristics of the main qualification at each level . the descriptors have two parts : the first part sets out the outcomes that a student should be able to demonstrate to be awarded that qualification . the second part describes the abilities that a typical holder of the qualification should have developed . the first part of the descriptor will be of particular importance to those designing , approving and reviewing programmes whilst the second part of the descriptor will be of importance to those bodies recruiting holders of awards for further study or employment . qaa reviewers will be concerned to establish that the design of a programme 's curriculum and assessments is such that all students following it have the opportunity to achieve and demonstrate the qualification outcomes specified in the descriptor . specific skills development is not covered in qualification descriptors as it is felt that this is more appropriately dealt with in subject benchmarks and individual programme specifications . this is because many skills are discipline or profession specific and even generic skills may be developed at different rates in different subjects . credit requirements the framework does not make any prescription about credit requirements for particular qualifications . however , the qaa were aware that many institutions use credit schemes . in november 2001 a document on ' credit guidelines for he qualifications ' was produced by the various regional credit consortia . its requirements have been adopted in the university 's credit accumulation and transfer scheme regulations . key implications for practice at southampton programme specifications as departments seek to revalidate existing provision in the form of a programme specification , and when developing specifications for new programmes of study , it will be important to ensure that the expression of learning outcomes at least meets , if not exceeds , those stipulated in the relevant qualification descriptor . the university 's cats regulations and guidelines for the development of new ug and pgi programmes have been informed by the demands of the nqf . honours degree in accordance with the terms of the bologna declaration , the honours degree should be understood as the qualification awarded on completion of ' first cycle ' studies . as such it provides access to ' second cycle ' ( i.e. postgraduate ) studies . the honours degree must provide grounding for progression to advanced scholarship and research , as well as preparing students for employment . degree titles the title ' degree ' can be used only for those awards at levels 2 , 3 , 4 or 5 that meet in full the expectations of the qualification descriptor . qualifications based on the study of two disciplines should consider nomenclature types ' a and b ' where there is an approximately equal balance between the two components and ' a with b ' for a major / minor combination where the minor subject accounts for at least a quarter of the programme . enhanced honours degrees ( undergraduate masters ) in order to use the masters title for extended undergraduate study , such programmes will need to demonstrate that the demands on the learner provide the intellectual challenge , skills , knowledge , ability to conceptualise , and learner autonomy that will enable the outcomes specified in the masters descriptor to be met . the qaa note that ' the learning outcomes required for a degree are unlikely to be achieved in less than the equivalent of one academic year 's full - time study which addresses these outcomes directly . ' this suggests that in order for undergraduate masters programmes to retain the masters title it is appropriate for the final year of study to concentrate on masters level outcomes . taught postgraduate masters although the nqf does not prescribe credit requirements for particular qualifications , the university will adopt the 180-credit structure for taught masters programmes ( ma , msc , m.res ) and the consequent 60 and 120 credit requirements for the pg certificate and pg diploma awards . this will ensure that there is ease of credit transfer between the university and others where the 180-credit structure is much in use . the nqf does not prescribe how much ug material may be used appropriately within a taught masters programme , but it is advised that no more than 30 credits at ug level may contribute towards a taught postgraduate masters degree . conversion programmes those programmes comprised solely of ug material and assessed at ug level , but for whom graduate entry is required may be titled as graduate certificate / diploma depending on the length of the programme . these are often ' conversion ' programmes which enable graduates from other disciplines to become accustomed to the details of the new subject and thereby move on to postgraduate study in due course . graduate entry to such programmes ensures that students have the study skills that will enable them to cope with a considerable amount of new material in a short time . when using the ' graduate ' stem in a qualification title then ' certificate ' should normally signify study equivalent to at least one - third of an academic year and ' diploma ' should normally signify study equivalent to at least two - thirds of an academic year . the mphil the mphil is to be considered a masters level qualification . it is an award based on extended masters study and is likely to involve a substantial element of research or equivalent enquiry . the mphil may be awarded to a student who has failed to meet the outcomes expressed for doctoral qualifications , provided they have met , if not exceeded , the demands expressed in the masters descriptor . doctoral qualifications titles used for doctoral qualifications awarded after programmes with a substantial taught element should normally include the name of the discipline in the title e.g. edd for doctor of education . overall , the impact of the nqf on practice at the university is to foster an environment in which there is far greater explicitness in learning outcomes for each programme of study than has existed previously . this is implemented through the generation of programme specifications . relevant links : l qaa framework for higher education qualifications in england wales and northern ireland - january 2001 note : this guidance document includes the qualification descriptors for the main qualification at each level of the framework ._. _ _ fans of the university of texas american football team , recently crowned national champions of us college football , are known for their boisterous support for their home team and state . that 's why nick bhavsar , chief executive officer of laptoplids and a texas graduate student , knew he was onto something with his burnt - orange laptop cover bearing the iconic image of a longhorn cow . the former intel engineer 's fledgling web company began selling vinyl laptop covers with the texas longhorns logo as well as the texas state flag in september 2005 . after texas won the national championship game at the rose bowl in early january and orders skyrocketed , bhavsar realised he 'd tapped into the growing demand for personalised laptop designs that are quickly vaulting the portable pc out of its model t era . according to legend , ford founder henry ford described his design philosophy for the model t as , " you can paint it any colour , so long as it 's black . " for many years a similar philosophy has held sway among laptop designers at the three largest pc companies in the world : dell , hewlett - packard and the former ibm pc business now owned by lenovo . apple , sony , acer , alienware , voodoo pc and others have introduced more stylish designs , but the standard products available from the largest windows pc vendors tend to come in either black or grey . that philosophy is starting to change . a few computer companies and several accessory makers and custom specialists have figured out that , like ' 70s - era flower - power vw camper vans and dot - com - era boy - racer vauxhall corsas , custom - look laptops can be seen as potent style statements . dell 's new xps renegade pc , introduced at the consumer electronics show this month , features a flashy , flame - covered case design . like laptoplids , dell has begun selling laptop covers along with its consumer laptops that add colour or collegiate logos to its products . hp 's livestrong laptop features lance armstrong 's signature yellow band in one of the company 's few nods to personalisation . and last autumn , chipmaker intel showed off a line of concept laptops that featured ultrasuede fabric on their casing . credit : smooth creations but custom designs are still relatively new to the mainstream pc industry . as a result , tech - savvy individuals looking for something different tend to produce their own creations , a practice known as ' case - modding ' . most case mods have involved desktop pcs , but now that laptop shipments are set to overtake desktops in coming years , consumers are looking for ways to make their mobile pcs stand out from the rest of the black - and - grey crowd , said tim bajarin , president of creative strategies . for the most part , they are finding what they need outside of the traditional technology vendors , he said . take skyn , which makes colourful laptop covers that can be reused on multiple laptops . skyn 's co - founder , letitia lucero , was looking for a colourful laptop a few years ago , but could n't find anything she liked . after experimenting with materials in partnership with her husband , miguel , they discovered a type of plastic that stood up to the wear and tear on a laptop , and applied an adhesive to the back that allows the cover to be removed and used on other laptops , a skyn spokeswoman said . last year , inclosia solutions and tulip distribution international holding teamed up to release a series of leather - covered laptops that are also available with fabrics such as denim . but if you 're looking for the ultimate in customisation , some companies will provide shiny paint jobs for laptops . an oregon company called smooth creations is taking its expertise in painting flashy designs on cars to the pc world . the 15-year - old company started painting desktop cases for individuals and pc enthusiast companies like alienware and hypersonic pc about five years ago , and expanded into laptops about a year and a half ago , said chris eddie , client services manager at smooth creations . customers can choose from several different metallic paint jobs or order special effects like colour - shifting paint , eddie said . another high - tech painter , colorware , specialises in adding colour to apple 's macs , ibooks and ipods . the company is looking into expanding its offerings to dell 's laptops , a representative said . potential customers should be aware that customising a laptop with one of these paint jobs might cause problems if that unit needs support later on from a larger vendor like hp or dell . smooth creations strips the laptop down to just the plastic elements in order to paint the chassis , eddie said . an hp spokeswoman said there was no specific policy in the company 's warranties about disassembling a laptop , but if an individual or a third - party company damaged a laptop in the course of painting it , hp would not cover that damage . a spokeswoman confirmed a similar policy regarding dell laptops . smooth creations ' eddie said his company would repair or replace anything damaged by its workers for free . consumers looking for flashy laptops will probably continue looking outside the mainstream pc industry for style and flair , bajarin said . given the thin margins of the pc business , large companies are interested in keeping costs as low as possible , and customisation raises costs , he said . " consumers buy on cost , and while you can potentially upgrade them to a bigger hard drive or perhaps one with a bigger screen , you 're going into new territory with pink or yellow or blue , " bajarin said . print this article email this article talkback more about laptops dell investigates exploding laptop report june 28 , 2006 news.blog : new vaio ' a tough nut to crack ' june 23 , 2006 apple wants mac geniuses june 22 , 2006 news.blog : dell launches its new latitude june 21 , 2006 samsung 's q1 origami tablet hits us stores june 20 , 2006_cd _ _ regulation on cross - border payments in euro ( ec regulation 2560/2001 ) guidance note the regulation on cross - border payments in euro was adopted in december 2001 and came into force on 31st december 2001 . as a regulation it is directly applicable in all member states , including the uk , and does not need transposing into uk law . the regulation : article 3 of the regulation requires that the charges levied by an institution for certain small value cross - border non - cash payments in euro within the eu ( � 12,500 to 31 december 2005 , � 50,000 thereafter ) are the same as the charges levied by that institution for corresponding domestic payments in euro . article 3 of the regulation takes effect from 1 july 2002 in relation to cross - border electronic payment transactions . this covers , for example , credit card and debit card payments , atm cash withdrawals and payments using cards that store credit . article 3 is also effective from 1 july 2003 in relation to cross - border credit transfers . this would cover , for example , a person wiring money from one member state to another . paper cheques are excluded from the regulation 's requirement for non - discrimination between domestic and cross - border charges . however , the charges applied to cheque transactions must still be transparent . in addition , the regulation allows non - euro area member states to opt to extend its application to cover payments denominated in their own currencies . the uk government does not intend to exercise this option . articles 4 and 5 impose further requirements on institutions , customers and suppliers . these articles apply even if the relevant institution only makes cross - border payments in euro . two examples of the regulation 's scope can be found at the end of this note . what banks and other financial institutions are required to do : articles 4 and 5 require institutions to make their charges transparent and also to communicate identification numbers to their customers for facilitating cross - border transfers . a : transparency : institutions must make available to their customers , in written and understandable form , prior information on the charges levied for cross - border payments in euro as well as for domestic payments in euro . this can be done electronically , provided that it is appropriate and in accordance with national rules ; institutions may also be required to provide a written warning to customers of the charges that are applied to the cross - border use of cheques in the cheque books themselves . this , is however , dependent on the member states ' discretion . modifications to any charges have to be communicated , in writing , to customers in advance of the date of application ; prior information has to be provided on exchange charges for changing currencies into and from euro as well as specific information on the charges that have actually been applied to transactions ; and customers also have to be notified of the charges that will be levied by the institution if , when making a cross - border payment , they do not communicate the international bank account number ( iban ) of the intended beneficiary and the bank identifier code ( bic ) of the beneficiary 's institution to their own institution . b : facilitation of transfers : institutions have to communicate to their customers , upon request , the customer 's iban and their bic . additionally , from 1 july 2003 institutions have to indicate on customers ' account statements , or in an annex thereto , their iban and the institution 's bic . customers ' responsibilities : a customer must communicate to the institution carrying out a cross - border euro transfer both the iban of the beneficiary and the bic of the beneficiary 's institution , if they are to benefit from the regulation ; and suppliers ' responsibilities : in the context of cross - border invoicing for goods and services in the community , suppliers who accept payment by transfer in euro have to communicate their iban and the bic of their institution to their customers . two examples of the regulation 's scope : 1:a uk customer ordering a credit transfer in � to a beneficiary in france : the transaction takes place in euro , therefore , as long as the customer 's bank offers a corresponding uk domestic euro credit transfer facility , article 3 will apply . 2:a uk customer ordering a credit transfer in � to a beneficiary in france : the order is given in � , therefore , article 3 will not apply ._. _ _ if i had known the reason -- perhaps quite commonplace -- of this neglect , i should have lost the unwritten poetry which intoxicated me . to me this refuge represented the most various phases of human life , shadowed by misfortune ; sometimes the peace of the graveyard without the dead , who speak in the language of epitaphs ; one day i saw in it the home of lepers ; another , the house of the atridae ; but , above all , i found there provincial life , with its contemplative ideas , its hour - glass existence . i often wept there , i never laughed . " more than once i felt involuntary terrors as i heard overhead the dull hum of the wings of some hurrying wood - pigeon . the earth is dank ; you must be on the watch for lizards , vipers , and frogs , wandering about with the wild freedom of nature ; above all , you must have no fear of cold , for in a few moments you feel an icy cloak settle on your shoulders , like the commendatore 's hand on don giovanni 's neck . " one evening i felt a shudder ; the wind had turned an old rusty weathercock , and the creaking sounded like a cry from the house , at the very moment when i was finishing a gloomy drama to account for this monumental embodiment of woe . i returned to my inn , lost in gloomy thoughts . when i had supped , the hostess came into my room with an air of mystery , and said , ' monsieur , here is monsieur regnault . ' " ' who is monsieur regnault ? ' " ' what , sir , do you not know monsieur regnault ?-- well , that 's odd , ' said she , leaving the room . " on a sudden i saw a man appear , tall , slim , dressed in black , hat in hand , who came in like a ram ready to butt his opponent , showing a receding forehead , a small pointed head , and a colorless face of the hue of a glass of dirty water . you would have taken him for an usher . the stranger wore an old coat , much worn at the seams ; but he had a diamond in his shirt frill , and gold rings in his ears . " ' monsieur , ' said i , ' whom have i the honor of addressing?'--he took a chair , placed himself in front of my fire , put his hat on my table , and answered while he rubbed his hands : ' dear me , it is very cold . --monsieur , i am monsieur regnault . ' " i was encouraging myself by saying to myself , ' il bondo cani ! seek ! ' " ' i am , ' he went on , ' notary at vendome . ' " ' i am delighted to hear it , monsieur , ' i exclaimed . ' but i am not in a position to make a will for reasons best known to myself . ' " ' one moment ! ' said he , holding up his hand as though to gain silence . ' allow me , monsieur , allow me ! i am informed that you sometimes go to walk in the garden of la grande breteche . ' " ' yes , monsieur . ' " ' one moment ! ' said he , repeating his gesture . ' that constitutes a misdemeanor . monsieur , as executor under the will of the late comtesse de merret , i come in her name to beg you to discontinue the practice . one moment ! i am not a turk , and do not wish to make a crime of it . and besides , you are free to be ignorant of the circumstances which compel me to leave the finest mansion in vendome to fall into ruin . nevertheless , monsieur , you must be a man of education , and you should know that the laws forbid , under heavy penalties , any trespass on enclosed property . a hedge is the same as a wall . but , the state in which the place is left may be an excuse for your curiosity . for my part , i should be quite content to make you free to come and go in the house ; but being bound to respect the will of the testatrix , i have the honor , monsieur , to beg that you will go into the garden no more . i myself , monsieur , since the will was read , have never set foot in the house , which , as i had the honor of informing you , is part of the estate of the late madame de merret . we have done nothing there but verify the number of doors and windows to assess the taxes i have to pay annually out of the funds left for that purpose by the late madame de merret . ah ! my dear sir , her will made a great commotion in the town . ' " the good man paused to blow his nose . i respected his volubility , perfectly understanding that the administration of madame de merret 's estate had been the most important event of his life , his reputation , his glory , his restoration . as i was forced to bid farewell to my beautiful reveries and romances , i was to reject learning the truth on official authority . " ' monsieur , ' said i , ' would it be indiscreet if i were to ask you the reasons for such eccentricity ? ' " at these words an expression , which revealed all the pleasure which men feel who are accustomed to ride a hobby , overspread the lawyer 's countenance . he pulled up the collar of his shirt with an air , took out his snuffbox , opened it , and offered me a pinch ; on my refusing , he took a large one . he was happy ! a man who has no hobby does not know all the good to be got out of life . a hobby is the happy medium between a passion and a monomania . at this moment i understood the whole bearing of sterne 's charming passion , and had a perfect idea of the delight with which my uncle toby , encouraged by trim , bestrode his hobby - horse .

" listen to a townswomen 's guild discuss americanisms in nantwich . more ... mark hughes from walsall does n't like it either : " the thing that drives me demented is the rampant americanisation of everything , especially british english , and the habit of turning nouns into verbs , such as prioritise and incentivise . yuk ! " british english borrows lots of words from american english . prioritise was apparently coined during the 1972 presidential election ; teenager , blizzard and belittle originated in the usa and , unsurprisingly , there are umpteen computer - related terms that come from the united states . it 's not always obvious to speakers where new words have emerged from . as virginia reed from california writes , " i thought incentivise was ' all your fault ' ! " " the assumption is that anything new is american and thus objectionable on double grounds . " the american linguist john algeo notes a propensity in the uk to attribute changes in british english to the influence of the usa , whether it 's justified or not : " the assumption is that anything new is american and thus objectionable on double grounds . " an example of misattribution is the word controversy . some people pronounce it with the stress on the first syllable : controversy ; others stress the second : controversy . it 's a widely - held belief that the second , newer pronunciation is an americanism , but it is n't - it originated in the uk . and for those of you who do n't like the phrase i guess ... , did you know that the word gesse ( for think or suppose ) was common in england in the middle ages , and i gesse ... crops up in chaucer ? patsy from cornwall deplores americanisms : " let us ensure that future generations learn to use english correctly . we should be aware that the english language originated in england and was taken from here to other english speaking countries . " listen to debbie in suffolk talk about the language of teenagers . more ... she 's right that english originated in england , but it 's not right to imply that other varieties of english are versions of ' our ' language . americans do n't speak a different version of british english ; english speakers in the uk and the usa speak modern dialects which have both evolved from 16th century english . today 's british english is no nearer that common ancestor than american english is ! as it happens , american english has been more conservative than british english in some respects . it has retained the third syllable of words like library and secretary , whilst many british dialects use the newer forms secretree and libree . old words like diaper and fall are still used in america but have been replaced by new words ( nappy and autumn ) in britain . why do so many people hate americanisms ? the word itself suggests it 's something to do with america , rather than linguistic borrowing in general . as the linguist steve jones points out : " ever heard jodhpurs referred to as an ' indianism ' or karaoke as a ' japism ' ? " he suggests that , " it would seem that when folk complain about the americanisation of the language , their complaint is really about the insidious effect of americanisation on our culture . " whatever your feelings are towards americanisms , there 's no reason to think we 'll all turn american any time soon . as peter trudgill explains , our language is most influenced by the people we interact with , not by watching tv . even though the american and british vocabularies are getting more similar , our accents and pronunciation are more different than they have ever been - and are growing further apart . what language changes annoy you ? malcolm snell from london its increasingly common to hear phrases like ' between you and i ' in place of ' between you and me ' , used even by apparently well - educated , professional people . you can hear and read things like : ' me and him went to the cinema together , and between you and i it was terrible , ' and i know primary schools where such writing would not be corrected or even attract comment . as far as i can see , schools are making no attempt to teach the proper use of personal pronouns even for the formal purposes we normally expect grammatically correct english in . i do n't resist linguistic change , but our pronouns are sliding into chaos . s stretton , southend . i lost count of the number of funny looks i got in america for saying " can i have " rather than " may i get " . i agree with carol , text speak is far more annoying than americanationisms . lol . natalie from suffolk all languages that are changing and evolving are living languages . a language that does not change is dead . you may not like linguistic changes and you will certainly have your opinions on new language varieties but at least our language is alive ! liam from inverness i must say , coming from the highlands of scotland , i genuinely struggle to understand a lot of english people due to pronouncing " arm " like " am " and " door " like " dough .

" when people ca n't tell the difference between a verb and a preposition , there 's issues . unnecessary shortening of words however , or writing things like " woz " instead of " was " really annoys me . it 's not even laziness - it 's the same length ! as for the rising tone , i use that , and so do n't see the issue . in my dialect at least , where a statement is meant as a question , extra words are used , generally ' aye ' at the end , to signify it 's a question . john of bristol the rules of english are an abstract construction of generalisations , they falsely pre - suppose that language can be bound by rules . in fact the colloquial language existed first and the rules were subsequently constructed in an attempt to provide a ' correct ' frame of usage . however like trying to herd cats it is not a possible task , and once again proves the adage that rules are meant for the obedience of fools but for the guidance of the wise . i am passionate about english and its correct usage , which actually is to communicate , and communicate not only meaning but passion , empathy and humanity . people use phrases like ' innit ' as a cultural bonding , to assume it is intended only to communicate some meaning is narrowing the wider general use of language . in my younger days i too became upset about the dumbing down of my mother tongue , but in reality the world is becoming better educated , and more sympathetic to the fact that life is not black and white and that rules should be questioned . english is the greatest language in the world , because it organically adapts and adopts , long may it do so , and long may it be wrested from those who attempt to constrain it . michael in wolves i think the americanisation of the the english language is something which is always going to get english people 's backs up . whilst i am usually a descriptive assessor of the english language rather than a prescriptive assessor , it somehow manages to rile me too . whilst i can not explain why this happens ( other than a general resentment of american imperialism ) it is an unfortunate affliction in britain . as per the article we are no closer to " real " english than our american cousins and whilst you may despise the americanism of the language i do n't hear wide dissenting voices when people in the north east say " treat " ( to rhyme with wet ) instead of treated , or " yam " in the black country instead of " you are " . there are regional varieties and we should accept it . as long as we can communicate there is n't a problem . as for the " charver " comments , i think these are slightly offensive . if someone picked on a " goth " or an " indie kid " in a public forum i 'm not sure they would receive the shame chortles of amusement . all you 're doing is showing your insecurities . rob phillips from somerset more so than any american encroachments upon standard english , i hate this latest fad for political correctness enforced by our over - excited institutions , such as " blackboard " altered to the more pc " chalkboard " , the name stems from the colour of the board , the word carries absolutely no connotations david from usa the english language never was perfect and is n't going to be perfect . language evolves and it 's as simple as that . gilbert from maryland i appreciate a well spoken sentence as much as the next person ; however it does annoy me when a sentence or phrase is spoken incorrectly on purpose . linguistic creativity should never include intentional ignorance , which is wide spread in the us . with that being said , the level of snobbery flowing from my ancestors place of origin , england , is repulsive . did anyone read the article ? british - english is no more correct than us - english ! i do love british land , history , and culture , admittedly more than my own , but give me a break ! mike jones from washington state , usa as an american , i 'd like to say that i really like the british form of english . when spoken by a native speaker , it sounds very regal and more formal than standard american english . and hearing it imitated and butchered is murder to me ( several students in my japanese class do it all the time ) . that being said , however , i 'd just like to point out that not all americans butcher the english language . in fact , i 've lived here all my life , and i 've never even heard some of the examples that have been given in previous comments . granted , we do have our flaws : the apparent and tragic death of the adverb , the misconception that " is " is a stand - alone word rather than a conjugation of " to be " , and the frightening overabundance of double ( and sometimes triple ) negatives . i even have a friend who never fails to use " seen " instead of " saw , " as in , " i seen a pretty girl at work today . " but all languages are , and always will be , evolving . does this mean we should just sit back and let our language degrade until it 's nothing but a bunch of grunts and moans ? no . but we also should n't nitpick about every little deviation from the norm . natural languages are full of irregularities , and english is no different , especially considering the fact that we 're discussing two entirely different dialects . be glad that they 're as similar as they are : most dialects of japanese are not even remotely mutually - intelligible with the standard dialect ! jack from heslington where do i start ... well , i 've noticed that recently on the bbc people are saying " take a ... ( eg " look " ) instead of have a ... ( eg " look " ) like they used to . another insidious americanism is " fill out " , what exactly is wrong with " fill in ( eg " a form " ) " ? ! this whole thing is a recent acceleration due to the most evil contamination of english yet - the " talking like people out of the sitcom ' friends ' " phenomenon - raising their vocal intonation at the end of almost every sentence ( as well as the flurry of " oh my god"s , " its like"s and " .. and i was like yeah"s they pack in to conceal the vapidity of their converstion ) , i have to stop people now and tell them they 're doing it , " it 's like , oh my god , i so want it to stop ? " . then the dimwitted practise of using " which " for every relative clause instead of " that " - please go and read a grammar book - and learn how to use a semi - colon whilst you;re at it - even dictionaries fail to give the correct definition of what a semi - colon is for - it is not a pause somewhere inbetwixt the length of a comma and a full stop ; it has a specific grammatical function and meaning ; as does a colon : look it up ! ... i and always insist on saying " i 've got " instead of " i have " , which sounds utterly american to me . and can somebody stop people from using " regular " to mean " normal " ? deport them to america , that 's what i say ! cath from bucks i do not mind how americanisms are affecting our language , however i am a teenager who believes the accents of my fellow classmates are ridiculous . a sort of cockney/ jamaican accent a lot of people use has the potential to wreck our accent and change our language into a slang - like , badly presented accent . who knows ? in fifty years children could be brought up with this ridiculous accent . it 's a shame that our distinctive accents in the uk could be destroyed . linda sutch from epsom it does not surprise me that our children are reported to have such a bad grasp of english , spelling , expression and grammar with all these different methods of communication around . i have sympathy for teachers and parents trying to help their children with school work , particularly if assignements involve the children finding out things for themselves and not being aware that a source of reference might be expressed in a different manner to british english . i get confused when trying to use help functions on a computer and find that the terms are spelt in american english , subsequently taking longer to get the help needed . i work in the nhs and i have seen patients being unable to understand some professionals , partly because of the way they address the patient and partly because of the expressions they use . it 's little wonder that some people who are hard of hearing or have some cognitive impairment which impedes their understanding of what has been asked of them . this has on occasions resulted in people being branded as have dementia , but when spoken to in a clear , slow and jargon free manner they are perfectly able to express themselves . this also involves the professional giving the person time to express themselves thus avoiding a misdiagnosis . dan and chloe , newcastle hello , we are studying english language at a - level at this particular moment and we are researching prescriptive views of the english language . so far we have decided that this seems to have been blown out of all proportion . yes it is a language and it will be needed but to be so argumentative about it seems , well , rather silly . thankyou for your views though , they have enlightened us and gave us a little giggle ! kiss kiss darlings laura e , bedford i detest the use of words in a sentence without any meaning for example ' innit ' ( not as you might think because it is used instead of is n't ) but when it is added onto the end of sentences such as ' we are going out innit ' it makes no sense at all ! it tends to be a southern problem , along with , assuming that the southern pronunication is correct - as a northerner i often have problems with people understading grass and path etc and am simply told ' oh you mean grarss ' , which is extremely patronising ! david harriman from cornwall i do n't think this is american , but what really annoys me is the way people raise the final note of their conversation , so that everything they say sounds like a question . " and also " should not be used together , because they mean the same thing . i object to being called a " brit " instead of british . i hate to hear " medieval " pronounced " medeeval " . you meet a friend , you do n't " meet with them " . why do people clutter their conversation with " .. and it was sort of like .. " ? casey from minneapolis , usa there is no stopping the eveloution of english , for the better or worse . in my opinion it 's for the worse here in the us . i lived in the uk for three years and noticed many things i had said all my life as an american was incorrect . the problem is that no one here in the states would ever correct me . one example is using good for well , and bad rather than poorly . it 's perfectly correct in the usa to say " sleep good " or " how are you ? " , response would be , " i 'm good . " or , " i did so bad on the test . " it 's funny in america when one says they are well they are looked at as not speaking correctly . laurence hallewell , colchester my prejudices are against ( 1 ) those who fail to realize that " moot " is the root of " meet " and so meangs " a coming together , especially for a discussion or debate " and has nothing to do with its us homonym " mute " , as in " the question is now moot / mute . " ( when they mean " no longer moot . " ( 2 ) those , including my own children , who pronounce " salt " with the short vowel of " bolt " instead of the long vowel of " all . " ( 3 ) similarly , those who pronounce " room " with a short vowel . ( 4 ) english folk who have adopted the fake aspirate of early victorian snobbery in " herb " and criticize americans for pronouncing it correctly ( " erb " ) . ( 5 ) anyone who replaces a short word such as " argentine " or " oriented " with an unnecessarily elongated form such as " argentinian " or " orientated . " ( 6 ) people who give romford or coventry their spelling pronunciation , failing to realize that english writes an " o " for a " u " whenever it is next to am " m " , " n " , " w " or " v " just so as to make the word easier to read in cursive or medieval handwriting , as in money , monkey , wolf , london , some , wolverhampton , etc . etc . ( 7 ) those who do not pronounce a final r even when the next word begins with a consonant , as in ira mispronounced eye - ah - eh . ( 7 ) those who in a similar situation pronounce a nonexistent final r , as in " lore and order . " ( 8) americans who omit the r in arse and even spell it without one . an ass is what our lord rode into jerusalem on . tim henderson from houston very entertaining thread . i must confess , thou , that my mother and teachers in the 1960 's used to berate the bad grammer of us children as an unholy deviant from the ' king 's english . ' in ohio , no less . still , i agree with the other writer that appreciates the many evolutions of the language . the turn of phrase from british authors , like j.k rowlings , for example , delight many american readers . so , in my best american english , " vive la diff � rence . " colin sharpe from connecticut as an englishman living in the usa , the things that annoy me most about " american english " is the use of " different than " rather than " different from " or " different to " . i also notice the widespread use in written english of " your " in place of the correct " you 're " as a contraction of " you are " . kevin from uk friends , english or any language is about communication . no more and no less ! different accents may make you felt uncomfortable but please open your arms your heart to welcome another person who merely speak english- the universal language . jackie d from middlesex i find it annoying when people order a coffee and they say " can i get ... ? " rather than " can i have ... ? " . it sounds so self - conscious , as if they 've just started trying to learn starbucks - speak . steven burns , reading what annoys me most ? two things . first , people saying " can i get " . the answer is " yes , you can get , but only if you say ' please may i have ' first " . i hear " can i get " over and over again in shops and pubs , it is not just the wrong question to ask , it is impolite . where has this come from ? do people think it 's " cool " to speak to shop , bar and restaurant workers in a dismissive and impolite manner , are they trying to point out to those around them that they are in some way superior to these people and , therefore , do not need to address them in a polite manner ? secondly , " yeah , no " . it seems to be becoming a standard form of response when a question is asked these days . which is it , " yes " or " no " ? it ca n't be both at the same time ! andy b from hull there are two southern english pronunciations that really annoy me : firstly , the addition of an extra ' r ' sound in words such as ' glass ' , ' brass ' , ' grass ' and ' fast ' - these become : ' glarss ' , ' brarss','grarss ' and ' farst ' ! i find it funny that this ' rule ' suddenly changes for words such as ' ass ' and ' fat ' and these last two words are pronounced just as a northerner would say them ! secondly , the annoying habit of changing the ' u ' sound . it 's changed to an ' a ' - a southerner would pronounce my home city as ' hal ' ; the word ' must ' as ' mast ' and finally , ' fuss ' as ' fass ' ! thom , york surely it 's americanization ? ! gordon nicol from dallas as an exiled scot living in the netherlands of civilzation , dallas , texas ( bush country ) i always cringe when i hear what george bush does to the english language . in scotland , we have our very own vernacular which we use amongst our own but , when speaking to those who do n't understand the scots tongue , we speak in the universal english language . imagine if tony blair spoke in the scots tongue , " helo'rer . hoo 's it goan ? ah dinnae ken hoo long it 's bin since we had sic a braw day . " well , i could n't believe my ears when i heard a bbc announcer quite clearly say " noocular " . what has the world come to when the bbc 's own emulates that so - called president who inspired the bumper sticker , " some village is missing an idiot . " and this , i 'm afraid , is n't an isolated incident . i 've heard this pronunciation two or three times . until now , i held the bbc in extremely high regard as does most of the us , but this is a terrible blow to that high standard . come on bbc wrap some knuckles and tell your people it 's bad enough when bush uses bush - isms , but we do n't need " our chaps " imitating his bushiness . lauren from the us as someone going to school for linguistics i love that there is such lively debate over these isssues and i 'm glad that the majority of people seem to appreciate that languages- all languages- change over time as societes and cultures change . every language and dialect should be appreciated for what it represents and what it means to those who speak it , none are any better or more valuable , at least linguistically . as for what rich m noted , that the " linguistically poorer " cousin of english in the us " just does not have the scope or breadth of the british version , " well that 's just a bit silly is n't it ? he mocked the word bugularise for being improper ( what counts as improper anyway ? ) but does n't it add something to the language ? does it not allow you to express an event more precisely or perhaps more vividly ? i do believe it does and i do think that the ability to coin new words or the phonomena of the evolution of semantics adds a richness to any language . and that 's my bit . alix , kent the enlish language has changed constantly throughout time in order to adapt to it 's more modern form . this will undoubtedly happen again to accomodate a bew generation of speech . look back , for exmaple , to the great vowel shift or how the english language has changed already , it has and to vast extent . the dictionary is constantly being updated so as to include new lexis , this has always happened and will continue to do so . people nowadays seem to be so set on keeping our language the way it is however why are people really so scared to let new lexis into our society ? language is never going to stay the same , it will always change so why try to prevent the inevitable ? james s from newcastle i am seriously annoyed that people , southerners in particular are misusing the word " charv " . they are pronouncing it without the ' r ' and this is inncorrect ! i am at liberty to tell you all that this word derived from the geordie culture as an expression to describe the charv scum that hang around in bus stops around the region . although these people are thought to be anyone who wears burbery this is wrong ; actually charvas are more likely to be dressed in rockports , berghaus ' and either a henry lloyd or fred perry jumper . therefore your definition of this word is wrong . the word originated from the scottish term for child similar to the geordie word bairn . and unlike the romanian version is spelt with an ' r ' . as the romanian gypsies came to our country later than the scottish clans this is more probable to be the original roots of the modern word charv . please change accordingly ! ! ! ! ! gail c. from florida formerly u.k. what a load of rubbish . is this all people have to worry about these days ? lucky them ! anon is it just my imagination or do computers use american tense and sentence construction , even if they are set to uk english default language ? ! i believe that you should be able to speak as you like , as long as you make sense , but this is the main problem with the ' youth culture ' today , they do not make sense when they speak ( if you can get more then a one word answer that is ) . i have read a number of points here and believe that if everyone used ' plain english ' it will help those from areas that encourage ' youth speak ' , simply because they do not understand jargon or long and complicated phraseology . why use ten words when you can use two ? roy f from slough different spellings and pronunciations are one thing , but what about words used incorrectly ? the most obvious for pc users is " alternate " instead of " alternative " . these two words have completely different meanings and the one adopted by microsoft , and increasingly by us all , is the wrong one . mark hughes from walsall yes , i agree with using ' o ' instead of ' zero ' in ' phone numbers , and ' railway station ' being better than ' train station ' . what about george bush 's ' nucular ' instead of ' nuclear weapons ' ! bless him . laura , from missouri as an american " americanisms " do n't generally bother me , however , certain phrases used repetitively such as , " ya know wha ahm sayin ? " and " wha 's up ? " are driving me mad . keith murray from venezuela a lot of people in all parts of the english speaking world suffer from language snobbery , but there is no doubt that the english are the worst offenders . people should learn to respect other people 's way of speaking . what an extremely boring world it would be if everyone spoke exactly the same as everybody else . betty greenhough from london , ontario , canada i am a retiree ( born in leeds , england ) , married to a beckanham - born english man . we have often had friendly arguments about the origin(s ) of the english language ! i always say that ' true english ' was born in the north of england - and that ' bbc english ' as i remember it when i left england in 1956 is not true english as is spoken generally ! any comments ? tk , in the uk . there is no right or wrong in pronunciation as differences are just that , differences . by trying ( and failing ) to say what is right or wrong , we are creating an unequal , prejudice and prescriptive world of � 1984 ' . it did n't work when the first dictionary was created , and it wo n't work now . language changes over time and we ca n't stop it unless we 're all dead and then it wo n't matter ! we should not create hierarchies of what dialects are � better � or � worse � . what is more important is to ensure our children can use language to their advantage by code switching as and when desired , and emancipate them in this way . many of the postings here worry me . i believe what is important is not what is right or wrong , but communicating as precisely as you can . i feel people 's grasp of grammar is more worrying ! take ; � stop children � � does that mean stop the children from doing something , or does that mean ; stop , there 's children about ? katherine critchley , liverpool i am increasingly annoyed with the misuse of the words ' myself ' and ' yourself ' in business and on television . i received a memo asking my to hand a report ' ... back to myself ' and heard a tv presenter talking about how ' myself and a friend visited ... ' . what is the problem with just saying ' me ' ? these people do n't seem to be able to break down their sentences . glenn hadikin from south korea all living languages change with time , we just have to get used to it . the only stable language is a dead one such as ancient greek . garry in cambridgeshire as a nasty american with a love for linguistics living here in england i find much of this comical . as the article stated , a great many of the ' americanisms ' you so deplore are actually left - overs of 16th century english that american english has preserved . shakespeare uses the word ' trash ' nearly two dozen times . he never uses ' rubbish ' once . we still use ' gotten ' as a vaild past tense of ' to get . ' the use of ' of ' which seems to be a particular irritant ( kind of , sort of , or even ' twenty of seven ' for time ) is an artifact of the time when ' of ' was an indefinite preposition that could adapt its meaning based on its use in the sentence . that is no longer permitted in the more modern english spoken here , but is still acceptable in the more antiquated form of english spoken in america . oh , and as i was poring through some old church records in derbyshire a few months ago , i was amazed to find the words honor , color , and labor all being spelled without the ' u ' by multiple vicars over a period of nearly eighty years in the 16th century ! before you decry some ' americanism ' do bother to pick up an old oxford dictionary - you may find the word in question only seems new because it died out here so long ago no one remembers it . so then , exactly who 's mucking up whose language here ? the reality is no one - it 's a living language . your version is no more authentic than mine or the canadians ' or the australians ' or the indians ' . let the french try to stop time for their language - let us allow english to continue to grow . ted hewlett from canada so many are upset because others use terms they are unfamiliar with . it makes more sense to be upset with verbal innacuracies and verbal pretense . i find some objections to americanisms sad because they seem to be reflective of hostility to americans as people . that is equivalent to racism . i 've recently come back from my seventh visit to england -- my favourite country to visit outside canada . i find the english people friendly and welcoming , but it pains me to see the rampant anti - americanism there , though it is found in canada too . sure there are extremes of american characteristics just as there extremes of english characteristics , but it is only the minority in both groups that have them . living only a short distance from the border with the united states , i have visited that country many times and found the people generally friendly and welcoming , as i have found the english ( whether relatives or strangers . terry denman from london i presume rich m from wales is using ' mad ' in the american sense of ' angry ' . and he does n't seem to know the difference between ' it 's ' and ' its ' . so much for good british english ! ian - from london . but brummie born having read through the various postings on the board , i have to say i agree wholeheartedly with most . not mentioned ( i do n't think ) is the habit amongst young people to say " innit " at the end of a sentence . whether question or statement of fact . and how about this ( australian ) variant on an everday english word ? " removalist " - for " removal man " or " remover ? " michael taylor from leeds how come americans seem to think we all talk queens english , just watch renee zelweger or paul vandyke try to do an english accent , they ought to speak to people from places with distinct accents like barnsley , newcastle and liverpool and see what the english accents really like . josh from london i realise that languages are always changing or evolving , but what i dislike about american habits of writing is the lackadaisical attitude to english . many ' new ' words or phrases are coined because people are simply lazy or do n't know enough about existing language usage . as an example , in the us , many people will often say " i could care less " when they actually mean " i could n't care less " . but the practice is now so widespread that it 's become acceptable colloquial usage . my impression is that there 's little love for the english language in the us . you only have to take a look at the quality of written content from blogs ( penned mainly by white , educated middle - class americans ) to see how apparent this is ! marcus , new york city has to be " at this time " or " at this hour " beloved by american newscasters and aped by the bbc . why use three words when three letters are adequate , that is " now " ? ricardo from brazil i prefer american english to british english , because the former has words that are more proper phonetically . why will you write " caesium " , if you say " cesium " ? there 's no reason . someone might think that it happens due to phonetic " heritage " , but where is the " � " ? should n't these letters be linked ; " a e " has a different sound from " � " . isabel , perthshire . misuse of " may " and " might " annoys me . e.g. " he may have been saved if help had come sooner . " no ! he might have been saved . " the word " may " implies doubt about the outcome . mike b. from south carolina ( usa ) in our defense , there is certainly a marked distinction between normal variations and improper usage . " should 've " is a contraction that , while perhaps worth avoiding in writing , is typical speech . converting that to " should of " drives many of us completely batty . rather , let me point out the general lack of ability to capitalize , spell , and punctuate . those , i think , irk us all to no end . i think a lot of it boils down to phonetic spelling -- phonics has been touted as the solution to children learning to read easily . but when it comes time to write , they write phonetically as well . consequently , normal dialect pronunciation becomes an incorrect spelling -- that 's not american , it 's just lazy . colin from oxford i agree with tony from reading . uptalking ( he calls it aqi ) is rapidly taking over speech in the uk . it 's like a disease . i was never this bad a year or two ago . i hear people from all ages uptalking and it makes me cringe . my theory ; a lot of us tv shows on uk tv and people imitate it thinking they sound cool . they do n't sound cool ; they just stupid and unsure of themselves . claire from london the word research should be pronounced with the stress on the second syllable , as in re - search , but increasingly i hear it pronounced as re - search . that 's wrong . the same goes for " finance " . rob from essex i studied english at uni . ( short for university ) ; that is , language not literature . people are snobs . a lot of the comments on this board are based on ignorance . if people are more concerned with the language as some sort of museum / zoo exhibit , rather than its use as a means to communicate , they should start learning esperanto . english is fascinating and flexible . this is because of the history of the english speakers and colonisation of the world of which english speakers have been very adept . notice i did not end my sentence with a preposition . what a hero elizabeth , hampshire there are n't really any things that annoy me . i think that language is used to communicate and so what if we say " me and you " not " you and i " ? they know what we mean , what difference does this make to general life ? i think silly things like that are just people being padantic over what people say and how they say it . kay harrington from battersea why have we lost the use of the present participle with the verbs ' to sit / stand ' ? even educated journalists now commonly say or write ' is sat / stood ' instead of ' is sitting / standing ' . has this come from a dialect or is it just ignorance ? jane rafferty from newcastle pronouncing the word " chav " to rhyme with " have " annoys me no end . it may come as no surprise that there have been charvers on tyneside for many years - the abbreviation " charv",which has been in common parlance in newcastle for ages , rhymes with carve . edward h.k. i agree with many of the comments above . however i feel that as english an international language we can not stop it from eventually changing . i feel that the most important thing we can do is to pass on what we feel are the correct rules to our children and so forth . alicia mitchell from london i think that saying ' twenty - oh - five ' is very sensible- we do n't say that the battle of hastings happened in ' one thousand and sixty - six ' , do we ? some things that does annoy me is the use of ' to be honest ' and ' .. if you know what i mean ' , as well as people responding to statements with ' really ? ' or ' seriously ? ' what do they expect you to say back- ' no , i 'm just pulling your leg ' ? overall , i have to agree with a lot of what people have been saying about accepting changes in language . i suspect that if you you went back in time and tried to have a chat with chaucer he 'd , like , totally not get you . sharon bell , stevenage to david dewar ... surely what people are saying is " should 've " rather than " should of " ? that 's a typical example of people saying stuff that 's correct when they do n't know that it 's correct and therefore do n't look for a normal spelling ( the same as " used to " becoming " use to " . i think it would really help kids if , in school , they would get more teaching about dialect and slang . it 's important to your identity to be able to use your dialect and write in it , and it 's important for getting on in the world to be able to know what 's dialect and what not , so you can switch to a more " standard " english to communicate with strangers . take a tip from the german speaking areas of switzerland where the kids are deliberately taught high german in school so they can speak to strangers and they can relate what they read ( all in high german ) to what they say at home and in the playground . charlie goring from eastbourne has anybody commented yet on the entry into the uk of the antipodean triple diphthong ? i refer , of course , to the way young people pronounce the word ' o ' . when i was young ( i 'm 45 ) kids said ' naaa ' for ' no ' . now they come out with a strange australian sound . this must come from neighbours . eastenders has clearly promoted estuary english ( so carefully cultivated by mr blair ) . ad then friends has had a lot to answer for with all its ' kinda likes ' etc . perhaps we could coin the term eastfriendbers to describe how young people speak today . miriam , yorkshire what really , really makes me cross is this : why has everyone started saying " please fill out the form " instead of " please fill in the form " ? ? they always say it at the bank and at the post office , for example . it gets me hopping mad ! i have asked people why this is , and they pretend not to know what i am talking about ! i am pretty sure it is an americanism , and i am surprised that no one has mentioned it already ! derek from telford thomas from philadelphia raises an interesting issue . the words schedule and school both came into english from old french through latin from greek . schedule is from the old - french word cedule ( with a soft c or � sh � ) and school from escole ( a hard c or � esk � ) hence the differing pronunciation of the ' sch ' prefix . the problem arose when the spelling of both words was defined as beginning with � sch � . pronouncing schedule with a soft c is now common in british english today . conversely to your reaction , and without wishing to be offensive , i find the pronunciation of schedule with a hard c to be reminiscent of � finger - nails scraping down a blackboard � . eleanor from warrington ' ahead of ' where did that come from ? it is continually used in place of ' before ' on the radio and in the press . why ? is it an americanisation ? does anyone know why it is used so much now ? kate from wales it 's " sitting on " not " sat on " - thank you , now i 've got that off my chest ! jennie from chesterfield some of the uses of language mentioned above do annoy me as i speak fairly standard english . however , lifes too short to worry about someone saying should 've or could 've instead of should have or could have . as long as you can communicate with those you wish to , it does n't matter how you speak ( or write ) . lee from london i detest those who say " should of " or " could of " instead of " should have " and " could have " . many people do not even know that the former expressions are completely incorrect ! this is often confused by people when it is abbreviated to " should 've " and " could 've " , although i am pretty sure that these people would never have seen these words written incorrectly in books or newspapers , so why many people continue to write such things is a total mystery to me ! colin hall from dundee it 's interesting to see how many people have stopped writing adjectives of nationality with capital letters . is this because of the influence of french and german ? at the moment this is wrong in english , but i presume it will become correct , just as spring , autumn etc . are no longer written with capitals as i was taught as a boy . nick russell from herefordshire if children at primary schools are called ' students ' , what do we call young men and women who are studying at university ? on the subject of which , when i was at university , 25 years ago , no - one had ever heard of the word ' uni ' . can it really have entered british english from an australian soap opera ? cathy , surrey uk in response to thomas from philadephia - i believe that the british pronouce schedule ' shedule ' because i think it originated from german , like ' schnell ' which i think is pronouced the same in the uk and us . however , having said this , the word ' school ' which might be from the german ' schule ' is n't pronouced using the same rule - it just goes to show , the pronunciation rules of our language are mad ! barbara m from prestatyn people saying zero instead of o ( like the letter ) when quoting telephone numbers . what is worse sometimes you will hear both used in the same number . how about quick instead of short - many television presenters seem to be fond of announcing that they are about to have a quick break when they about to go to commercials - most irritating . mark s from durham by far the most annoying linguistic change has to be the use of southern dialect pronoun " mum " in north eastern newspapers . it 's not ' wrong ' ( no dialect term is ) but it is simply not reflective of the dialects of the region . its use may erode my favourite dialect term - " mam " . helen , glasgow the americanisation of our dates annoys me ! even the bbc newreaders have started doing it ! for example , ' july 4th ' instead of ' the 4th of july ' or ' july the 4th ' . really really irritating ... mark from birkenhead what is this new black influnced acent that youngsters are taking up ? presumably they thinks it makes them sound cool but saying ' fink ' and ' aks ' instead of think and ask just makes them seem desparate to be cool . there 's a difference . also , how many americans have trouble with the word ' understand ' . here 's a clue , there 's no ' h ' but there is a ' d ' . it 's understand , not unnershtand . rant over . anthony , uk now germany i share many of the frustrations expressed above ( particularly annoying for me is the dropping of pronouns ) ... but the english ( americans neither for that matter)no longer own the english language . it is being shaped by all those whose mother tongue is not english . i work in an international environment where constantly i have to listen to ' nails scraping on a blackboard ' , and where if i do n't understand what someone has said i 'm seemingly , the one at fault . so watch out .. it will get worse ... i mean worse , not different ! xiaoma from china i 've been taught american english as my second language since i got to study english . yet , at the time i landed at the british isles i started to find british dialects more articulate and be saving my tongue out of rolling to intonate that difficult " r " sound john , gosport i used to get upset by americanisation of ' british ' english , but i find it less distressing now . as i moved around the country i realised that there are many english dialects that were different to the ' british ' english i knew . then i met some australians and some west indians and discovered that they have different ways of saying things as well . but it was n't until i did a little research into the origins of words that i really realised what a ' living ' language is all about . english is a live language , it is growing and changing . it will acquire different words , pronunciation and grammar . we have been getting ' new ' words from different countries for years - ever since ' brits ' started traveling the globe . now america has taken over the mantle of world leader and language spreader - so we get americanisms . there is nothing that we can do about that , except sit back and enjoy the language as it is and marvel at the way it changes . that is much more fun that trying to kill a living language . after all , its only dead languages that remain constant . april from illinois my , my , my . really tried not to respond ( nitpicking and all ) . but , am english teacher , and hafta ... " so not right " is hardly newspeak ( especially when there are other blatant examples of that -- just watch my government ) . as for straight as , i never heard that as in contrast to a plus or a minus , just that you got as in all subjects that term . probably will upset some , to respond to language change prompt with abbreviated english . it 's not because i 'm american -- it 's because i 'm lazy ! anthony - oxfordshire i can not stand the " twenty - oh - five " much beloved by radio four newsreaders , but very few others . what is wrong with " two - thousand - and - five ? " or better still " this year ! " n.c. from new york state , u.s.a. peter from oxford is incorrect in his interpretation of the american phrase " straight as . " when someone receives straight as , it means that a is the only grade that person received in every subject on his or her report card : no bs , cs , ds , or fs . many ( not all ) u.s. educational institutions do add plusses and minuses to letter grades , but most american students who had a few a- grades mixed in with the a grades would still claim " straight as . " ella from sussex living in canada this is to peter mackridge from oxford - actually , saying that one received ' straight a 's ' means that one received an ' a ' in every subject . someone could receive 5 a grades and 2 a- grades and still say they had ' straight a 's ' . also , split infinitives are n't particularly american ( or british , or anything ) - all english speakers have been using split infinitives since the year dot - that particular proscription is an odd leftover from latin class . michael f from lancashire further to miles davies ' comment on the use of the word " like " , i deplore the use of " i was like " to mean"i said " . valerie , american in the uk we forget that many english words are derived from french , german and latin as well . in some cases , the americans have it right , ie : lieutenant pronounced in the french way , rather than as " leftenant " as it is a french word . many of the things people have said they , like , despise , are utterly wrong in the american form of english too . they 're teenager - speak or regionalisms , not the way most americans are taught to speak in school . emma , kent like a. sanders i was always annoyed at the americanism of using ' kid ' , until that is i found an old dictionary from when my mum was at school which stated that kid is actually short for kiddie or kiddy , an old english word for child . laura gudim from croatia , formally uk as a linguist and speaker of many languages , i am shocked at how my mother tongue english is deteriorating and becoming totally americanised . for example , the majority of british sports commentators say kilometre , instead of the correct kilometere . this is one of many examples , why ca n't we just stick to ' film ' like every other european language , instead of the ' cool ' american ' movie ' . and when you lose your job you ' get the sack ' - you are not ' fired'.i totally agree that ' text - speak ' is much to blame for the bad spelling , grammar and punctuation . david dewar from cumbria i am unsure how many of these originated from american usage , but they are always annoying : i. i am fed up of ... , rather than i am fed up with ... ii . i could of done ... , rather than i could have done ... iii . split infinitives iv . tautologies , for example : ' foot pedals ' - what other kind of pedals could there be ? hand pedals ? v. ' different than ... ' when it should be ' different from ... ' , as should be apparent from the usage ' x differs from y ' thomas de witt , the netherlands i think that people who complain about the rising tide of americanisms in the english language do so because they do not like americans . english is fast becoming a universal lingua franca for the entire planet and it would not play that role if it were n't for the americans . 70 % of all native speakers of english live in the usa . i come across dialects in england that i find impossible to understand ( glasgow , durham ) , i have yet to encounter the first american dialect that is incomprehensible . that has to do with the fact that british english drops more sounds than does american . so as a world language american english looks like being more suitable . peter , seattle no mention of the vanishing u in colour / color or favour / favor and the inverted er in litre / liter ? or the disappearing syllable in aluminium / aluminum ? whenever a conversation regarding english / american comes up these are always the first mentions . fiona from devon americanisation annoys me , especially when tony blair does it ! ! i noticed him saying ' period ' at the end of one of his sentences , as in that s it , no more to be said . dan ryan ( manchester , now switzerland ) i love all accents and dialects of english , at home and abroad . though i do find that us broadcast english can be strain where the intonation is concerned . it 's flat and unvaried . i much prefer american regional speech , such as the " southern drawl " or new england dialects . new york / brooklyn dialect is fun to listen to , too . but there 's nought like our lanky ! peter mackridge from oxford there 's nothing wrong with american english in itself , but i get annoyed with british people who imitate american usage and get it wrong . this time of year everyone 's talking about getting " straight as " in the a - levels . what are as when they 're not straight ? the answer is that in the us there 's a grade called a- ( a minus ) which is below the top grade of a. so " straight as " means " all plain as with no minuses " . liesl from madison , wi someone wrote : the general replacement of " have you got ? " by " do you have ? " the latter and more american form is the ancestral one . the use of the newer past participle " got " instead of the original " gotten " ( retained in the us ) makes this fairly obvious . alec s from london someone 's said it already but the misuse of ' literally ' frustrates me to no end ! you did n't literally turn green with envy . your skin did n't literally crawl . your mother would literally roll in her grave if she heard you saying so ! james allen from bristol estuary english - the way too many people under 30 feel they have to conform to speak . there are an infinite number of accents and dialects to take up if you do n't like rp standard english . be different from the herd and adopt something nicer -like oxford ! thomas from philadelphia in general a british accent is a soothing sound to my ears and is frequently used in american programming for authoritative naration . there 's one pronunciation though that is like fingers on a chalkboard to me : the pronunciation of schedule as " shedule " instead of " skedule " . is that what is taught there in shools ( sic ) ? chris , czech republic i do n't get annoyed by language change , because it 's always happened and always will . language does n't get " better " or " worse " over time - its ability to express things does n't change , it just expresses them in changing ways . what is annoying , though , is unclear , cliched and jargon - ridden use of language - but that 's nothing new either . by the way , your contributor jack from belfast objects to " the team have " , but that 's actually nothing to do with language change . it 's a feature of british english rather than american english , and it 's known as the " notional plural " , because even though grammatically the word " team " is singular , it actually refers to a plural notion , because we 're talking about more than one person . just like in the sentence " the police are looking for the culprits " . the opposite is the " notional singular " , which can be seen in the use of " united states " with a singular verb ( because it 's a single country ) : " the united states has withdrawn its troops " . margaret cowling - cambridge i loath the term ' train station ' . i think this is probably another american term . i prefer ' railway station ' . i also hate ' 24/7 ' and when and where did we get ' bored of ' instead of ' bored with ' ? jack h of belfast i hate to hear people use a pluarlised verb with a singular noun as in ' the team have ' when it should be ' the team has . ' paul truswell from macclesfield is it just me or has anyone else noticed that " right " and " wrong " has been almost totally been replaced by " appropriate " and " inappropriate " . now is that a comment on language or on society ? guy wise of belfast . to me the most objectionable changes in the language are those which come about via an incorrect use of words , often through ignorance . consider today 's use of the word ' dubious ' when ' doubtful ' is meant and the football phrase ' a cynical foul ' when the word ' callous ' is meant . the liberal acceptance , in the uk , of such usage undermines the semantic heritage of the language and its teaching to foreigners . irene . devon it really annoys me when people say"any fink " when they actually mean " anything!"this seems to becoming more common on all the t.v. soaps and not just locally . steve from cheshire " i was so surprised , i literally jumped out of my skin . " no you did n't . literally ! steven from cheshire on a slightly related note , i 'm often thrown when watching american news broadcasts upon hearing , " you can write us at the following address " . i 'm expected " write to us ... " . but then i got to thinking : why is it we add the extra word over this side of the pond ? we do n't say " phone to me " , nor " email to me " , nor " visit to me " - so why do we " write to me " ? it may sound odd to my ear , but give the americans credit for at least being consistent . stephen , cambridge in common speech , the word " definitely " is over - used . younger people will almost always say " definitely " to agree with something you said , or to acknowledge what was said . the word " excellent " is also over - used as a positive acknowledgement for the smallest of things . e.g. " i 've just put your drink in the fridge " - " excellent " . the word used to describe something of exceptional quality , but the over - use of the word in casual contexts is making it less powerful and less formal . and , get rid of " sort of " , " like " , " kind of " , " kinda " , " i mean " , which all mean " ummm " . stuart - london what annoys me is people complaining about the way other people speak and about the way it changes . language is change . language is variation . simple as that . always has been , always will be . to sit there and complain about said changes and variations is akin to canute trying to hold back the sea - no matter how much we complain those variations and changes will not halt and revert back to some other person 's ideal for the language . rich m ex wales now usa hate the us version of english . drives me absolutely mad . i do hope , probably in vain , that the british version does not become too saturated by it 's linguistically poorer cousin in the us . the us version just does not have the scope or breadth of the british version . burglarize ! really ! what sort of idiot thought that up ? my first language is welsh and i am very proud of the fact that i learned a reasonably good form of standard british english - it has opened many doors for me over here . christine from east lothian i do n't know if i find this annoying or charming : the tendency of young children to speak in " american " accents when playing any kind of energetic imaginative game ( cops and robbers , aliens from space etc ) . i assume it 's because most of that kind of action they see on the tv is from american programmes or films . alastair muirhead , reading the intrusive ' r ' ; " pacifically " instead of " specifically " ; " lickorish " instead of " liquorice " with an " issss " ; " graahs " instead of " grass " ; ok , i 'll own up - i 'm scottish and we do pronounce words very literally - but more clearly i would suggest ? miles davies i really dislike the ' americanisation ' of our language - particularly the inclusion of the word ' like ' after every other word . the other one is the inclusion of ' so ' that makes a sentence completely wrong ' that is so not right ' for example . all of this reminds me on newspeak in 1984 - doubleplusgood ! ! ! anna , glasgow magazine writers are the worst culprits by far . they have started shortening words - bessie mate , boyf and worst of all fave - grrrr ! i hate it , i hate it , i hate it . i 've also noticed people writing " a good thing " as a sentence all on its own , for example " busted have split up . a good thing . " and lastly the word " so " , always written in italics , and always makes my skin crawl ! maaurice vizard from wigan it 's no wonder pupils can no longer spell , when the media insist on corrupting the spoken word when one would expect them to be setting an example by speaking the queen 's english no matter which dialect is used . it 's a matter of incorrect diction and it drives me round the bend when recently i even heard an artist talking about a ' droring ' for heaven 's sake . peter j the bbc have helped with the americanisation of the way we pronounce iraq ( from i rark - ryming with dark to eye rack ) . i was absolitely horrified that news readers got away with it ! chris hole from norfolk er ... very little actually . language changes as society changes , so to complain about the state of the english language ( and that seems to me bordering on arrogance - as though our little island has some sort of copyright on english ! ) seems to me to be the same as complaining how everything is going to the dogs , and we should bring back the birch . far healthier to celebrate the diversity and range of our society , and acknowledge the seemingly limitless capacity english has for embracing subtleties and shades of meaning that reflect the society we have today . a. sanders that the words " children " or " child " is never used and has been replaced by " kids " in every context . paul truswell from macclesfield i agree wholeheartedly with tony from reading ; or what too many would intonate as " .. from reading ? ? " in that " just checking - that - you - know where reading is " tone . aaaagh - i know where reading is , i 've lived in the uk over 40 years ! ! michael hales , brussels the written and spoken use of " an " before words starting with h ( other than where the h is silent ) . the general replacement of " have you got ? " by " do you have ? " . the scream - inducing " me either " . the pronunciation of " lingerie " as " lon - jer - ay " instead of " lan - jer - ee " . " twice as much than " instead of " twice as much as " . use of american stresses such as baghdad or copenhagen . " excuse me " instead of " pardon " . " to convince someone to " rqther than " to persuade someone to " . tony from reading what language change annoys me ? aqi ! the habit of finishing a statement with a rising intonation and thus making it sound like a question . ugh . adam d'souza from exmoor further to veronica 's quote above , in westcountry parlance it is perfectly normal to change vowel sounds at the end of words to include an -r . ' law and order ' would be pronounced in somerset as ' lorenorder ' . carol p from surrey i am worried by the effect of ' text - speak ' ( as used on mobile ' phones ) on the ability to spell our words , whether in an american dialect or british . it recalls the dreaded initial teaching alphabet of the 1970s . what do you think ? send us your thoughts using the form below . name and location ( e.g. john harris from rhyl ) : comment : comments will be included at the producer 's discretion , and may be edited for length and content before publication . please do not submit urls , or personal information such as telephone numbers or email addresses ._. _ _ the finest in classic portraiture at the black & white picture place original photography for all occasions . click on caroline to find out more a virtual stroll around the walls of chester chester 's visitors through the ages : 5 thomas pennant ( 1726 - 98 ) , a flintshire landowner , was a distinguished naturalist and travel writer . he was the author of a tour in scotland ( 1771 ) and three tours in wales ( 1778 - 81 ) his first welsh tour , taking in chester , was undertaken in 1773 . dr. johnson called pennant the best travel writer he had read ... " the approach to the city is over a very narrow and dangerous bridge , of seven irregular arches , till of late rendered more inconvenient by the antient gateways at each end , formerly necessary enough , to provent the inroads of my countrymen , who often carried fire and sword to these suburbs ; which were so frequently burnt , as to be called by the britons tre - boeth , or the burnt town ... the form of the city evinces its origin to have been roman , being in the figure of their camps ; with four gates ; four principal streets ; and a variety of lesser , crossing the others at right angles , so as to divide the whole into lesser squares . the walls , the precincts of the present city , mark the limits of the antient . no part of the old walls exist ; but they stood , like the modern , on the soft freestone rock , high above the circumjacent country , and escarpes on every front . the structure of the four principal streets is without parallel . they run direct from east to west , and north to south ; and were excavated out of the earth , and sunk many feet beneath the surface . the carriages drive far below the level of the kitchens , on a line with ranges of shops ; over which , on each side of the streets , passengers walk from end to end , secure from wet or heat , in galleries ( or rows , as they are called ) purloined from the first floor of each house , open in front and balustraded . the back - courts of all these houses are level with the rows ; but to go into any of those four streets , it is necessary to descend a flight of several steps ... the streets were once considerably deeper , as is apparent from the shops , whose floors lie far below the present pavement . in digging foundations for houses , the roman pavement is often discovered at the depth of four feet beneath the modern . the lesser streets and alleys , which run into the principal streets , sloped to the bottoms of the latter , as is particularly visible in lower bridge street ; but these are destitute of the galleries or rows ... near the bridge - gate is one ascent to the city walls ; which are the only entire specimen of antient fortification now in great britain . they are a mile and three quarters , and a hundred and one yards in circumference ; and , being the principal walk of the inhabitants , are kept in excellent repair by certain impost , called murage duties , collected at the custom house , upon all goods and merchandize brought into the port of chester from parts beyond the seas , belonging to persons not freemen of the city . the castle is composed of two parts , an upper and a lower : each with a strong gate , defended by a round bastion on each side , with a ditch , and formerly with draw - bridges . within the precincts of the upper ballium are to be seen some towers of norman architecture , square , with square projections at each corner , very slightly salient . the handsomest is that called julius caesar 's ... on the sides of the lower court stands the noble room called hugh lupus 's hall , in which the courts of justice for the county are held . the length of it is near ninety - nine feet ; the breadth forty - five ; the height very aweful , and worthy the state apartment of a great baron . the roof supported by wood work , in a bold style , carved ; and placed on tho sides , resting on stout brackets ... the county jail for felons and debtors is the last place to bo described . i can do little more than confirm the account of it by the humane howard . their day - confinement is in a little yard , surrounded on all sides by lofty buildings , impervious to the air , excepting from above , and ever unvisited by the purifying rays of the sun . their nocturnal apartment are in cells seven feet and a half by three and a half , ranged on one side by a sub terraneous dungeon ; in each of which are often lodged three or four persons . the whole is rendered more ( wholesomely ) horrible , by being pitched over three or four times in the year . the scanty air of the streight prison - yard is to travel through three passages to arrive at them : through the window of an adjacent room ; through a grate in the floor of the said room into the dungeon ; and finally , from the dungeon , through a little grate above the door of each of their kennels . ln such places as these are the innocent and the guilty permitted to be lodged , till the law decides their fate . i am sure the humane keeper , mr . thomas , must feel many a pang at the necessary discharge of his duty . mr. howard compares the place to the black - hole at calcutta . the view i had of it , assisted to raise the idea of a much worse prison ; where no light , but rather darkness visible , served only to discover sights of woe . ... the present cathedral appears to have been built in the reigns of henry vi , vii and viii ; but principally in those of tho two last . . . the center beneath the great tower is much injured by a modern bell - loft , which conceals a crown - work of stone , that would have a good effect was the loft destroyed ... the choir is very neat ; and the gothic tabernacle - work over the stalls carved in a light and elegant manner . st. john 's , which lies without the walls on the east side of the city , was once a collegiate church ... when entire , [ it ] was a magnificent pile . the tower once stood in the center ; but falling down in 1574 , was never rebuilt . the chancel was probably demolished at the same time ; at that end are still some fine arches , and other remains of antient chapels . withinside are curious specimens of the clumsy strength of saxon architecture , in the massy columns and round arches which support the body . the tower is now placed at the west end and has on one side the legend , represented by the figure of a man and a hind ... tho number of parishes are nine . none of the churches are remarkable , excepting those of st. peter 's and trinity , distinguished by their handsome spires . the first was finished in 1489 ; when the parson and others signalized themselves by eating part of a goose on it , and flinging the rest into the four streets . the number of inhabitants , including the suburbs of boughton and hanbridge , are estimated to be fourteen thousand seven hundred and thirteen . the houses are almost entirely situated on a dry sand - stone rock . whether it be owing to that , the clearness of the air , and the purity of the water , it is certain that the proportion of deaths among the inhabitants is only as one to thirty - one ; whereas i am informed , by my worthy friend doctor haygarth of this city , that in leeds , one in twenty - one ; in north ampton and shrewsbury , one in twenty - six ; and in london , one in twenty and three - fourths , annually pay the great tribute of nature " . right : the ruins of st. john 's church by george cuitt ( 1779 - 1854 ) " i do not recollect any thing remarkable on the outside walls which has been unnoticed , unless it be the rood - eye , and the adjacent places . the dee , after quitting the contracted pass at the bridge , flows beneath an incurvated clayey cliff , and washes on the right a fine and extensive meadow , long since protected against its ravages by a lofty dike ... at one end of the rood - eye stands the house of lndustry ; a large and useful building , founded in 1757 , by money raised by the city on life annuities , for several improvements within its liberties . here the indigent are provided for in a fit manner , and to the great ease of the parishes ; which are relieved from the burden of a numerous poor , who are too idle to work , and too proud to enter into this comfortable asylum ... a little beyond this building are the quays , cranes , warehouses , and other requisites for carrying on the naval trade of the city . these are opposite to the water - gate ; and have been much improved of late years , and the intervening space filled with a neat street . ships of 350 tons burden can now reach the quays , where the spring - tides rise at a medium fifteen feet : the neap - tides , eight ... there was lately a very fair prospect of adding much to the trade of the city , by an inland navigation , which was begun with great spirit a few years ago . it was to run through the county beneath beeston castle , and to terminate near middlewich . another branch was to extend to namptwich . one mouth opens into the dee , below the water - tower . a fine bason is formed , into which the boats are to descend , by means of five successive locks , beneath the northern walls of the city , cut in the live rock . a few miles of this design are completed : but , by an unhappy miscalculation of expence , and by unforeseen difficulties occurring in the execution , such enormous charges were incurred , as to put a stop for the present to all proceedings ... the idea of a canal along the dead flat between chester and ince has been long since conceived , by persons very conversant in the nature of the trade of this city . one mouth might have opened into the dee in tho place of the present ; another near ince , which would create a ready inter course with liverpool , the weever , and the salt - works and great dairies on that river ; with warrington , and with the flourishing town of manchester , and a numerous set of places within reach of the mersey , and of the canal belonging to that useful peer , the duke of bridgewater , to which the greatest of our inland navigations is connected . this little cut the city might , and still may , enjoy unenvied , unrivalled ;

" on to an eighteenth and some nineteenth century traveller 's tales of chester ..._: _ _ monthly review , n.s . 1 ( jan 1826 ) : 97 - 106 . report , not perhaps inartificially got up , has attributed this work to a person of distinction in the circles of fashion . if there be no foundation for this ' loud whisper , ' and we rather suspect that there is not , such a mode of attracting and deceiving public attention can not be too strongly reprobated . the injury which it inflicts on the real author , who , though he can not count ten generations in his family , may still be an individual of great respectability , as he certainly is a writer of considerable talent , is not the only evil consequence arising from this false reputation . if almost every new tale which is published , is said to be the production of [ 97/98 ] ' a young nobleman , ' the phrase will take its course from the highest to the lowest branches of the trade , and will become so ridiculous , that the very apprehension of its applicability will deter many of the brilliant and accomplished minds which adorn the aristocracy of england , from permitting themselves to indulge in one of the most fascinating departments of literature . ' granby , ' we venture to assert , is not the work of a mind which has been accustomed to view society from the ' vantage ground of elevated rank . it is the production of a practised writer , who , however conversant he may be with the fashionable lounges of this great metropolis , may still be contented to derive his claims upon our notice , rather from his merits as a novelist , than from any spurious pretensions to nobility which others have set up for him . there is much that is worthy of admiration in the work before us . the style in which it is written is remarkably simple , fluent , and idiomatic . sometimes it rises to a degree of elegance , particularly where the author is engaged in describing a fine landscape , or in reporting the conversations of his favourite personages . the pervading fault of granby is , that it abounds with dramatis person � whose characters are described with superfluous minuteness , but who are seldom made to act in conformity with them . they are announced individually with all imaginable pomp ; every feature of their countenances , every peculiarity of their temperaments , is analysed before - hand with the most scrutinizing diligence , so that when the parties appear before us , we seem to know much more about them than they do themselves , or than their language or actions can justify . besides , of the whole squadron , consisting of some fifty persons , who are thus painted for us at full length , there are not above one or two for whom we feel any great degree of interest . the true master in his art seldom describes his characters at all . he makes the reader acquainted with them by means of what they do or suffer , not by the attributes which he ascribes to them . next to this fault of over - wrought description , these volumes are swelled out by a succession of conversations , the greater part of which , after we have waded through them , leave no impression whatever on the mind . they are mere badinage , a collection of the most trifling and unamusing attempts at wit and repartee , interspersed with some villanous puns and vulgar jokes , such as we are surprized to hear in the company to which the author introduces us . to this remark there are some exceptions . we regret that they are too few . granby , the hero of the tale , is a good sort of young man , who acts the amiable on all occasions , and sometimes appears in a most disinterested and honourable capacity , without ever impressing us with the idea of magnanimity . as the author has drawn him , his virtues are more allied to timidity and weakness of character , than to real dignity of mind . the whole story turns [ 98/99 ] upon an early attachment which he formed for a cousin of his own , whose friends contrive from prudential motives to counteract , for a whole year , the steps which he took to advance their union . the lady is thus described in the author 's usual minute and ' lengthy ' manner . ' caroline jermyn was worthy of all the love and admiration which she had inspired in our hero . without possessing that faultless regularity of feature , the very blamelessness of which is sometimes insipid , she united the charm of interesting expression , to a face and figure which were sufficiently good to obtain an approval from the most fastidious eye . there was a sunny brightness in her smile , the charm of which could not be overlooked ; and her cheerful and even spirits , and playful vivacity , were rendered still more attractive by her unvarying sweetness of temper . she also possessed considerable quickness of perception , mixed with a candour and good nature which made her ever ready to excuse those follies which she was so prompt in discovering . she was young , and had hitherto seen little of the world ; and society on an extended scale was still almost new to her ; but she brought with her an innate tact , the united result of good sense and good taste and powers of pleasing , of which she was always less aware than those who were in her company . she had a good deal of diffidence , and a sensitive delicacy of feeling , which gave to her manner an occasional shade of reserve ; but it was reserve without coldness , and which did not even injure the artless sincerity of her address ; it was a reserve which scarcely any who witnessed it could wish to see removed , so well did it accord with the graceful softness of her character . she was totally free from affectation , and had a shrinking dread of display , which gave an intrinsic value to those captivating qualities which she unconsciously exhibited . ' caroline jermyn felt a sincere and strong attachment to henry granby , whom she had now known for several years . she could remember to have liked him from the first period of their acquaintance ; and that sentiment , which began in girlish admiration , ripened with her years into actual love . she , indeed , would not have given it that name ; but how could one interpret otherwise her eagerness to insure his good opinion ; her eye that watched his looks so timidly , yet anxiously ; her abstracted mien when he was absent ; her brightening countenance when he approached ? she felt that she had derived , not only pleasure , but advantage from his society . his correct taste had enabled him to enter judiciously into her pursuits ; it was his pencil that first called forth the powers of her 's ; his love of music that chiefly urged her to excel . her literary taste had also been in a great degree guided and encouraged by his ; and her talents , which amply repaid their cultivation , had not been suffered to lie waste . she was generally , but not pedantically accomplished ; and without being profoundly or scientifically learned , was well informed on most topics of elegant and useful knowledge , and such as give a value and a grace to the intercourse of polished society . ' --vol . i. pp . 46 - 49 . lady jermyn , and her husband sir thomas , who are well pourtrayed , had higher views for their daughter than granby 's expectations at that period held out . he was then living with his uncle , general granby , a retired officer , possessing a limited in-[99/100]come ; and he did not yet know that the estates of another uncle , lord malton , together with the title , were to descend to him on failure of male issue in the right line . the world imagined that lord malton 's heir would be his son tyrrel , but it turns out in the sequel of the tale that the latter was the fruit of an illicit passion , substituted in infancy by the father 's desire for the real heir , who died almost as soon as he was born . of this same tyrrel the author makes most unsparing use . he is the evil demon from whose machinations spring all the troubles and disappointments experienced by granby . upon the whole , we think that the character of tyrrel is drawn without any regard to vraisemblance . he is a profligate gamester , a treacherous friend , a mercenary suitor , and , withal , a man of fashion . when driven to an emergency , he becomes a ruffian of the lowest cast . all his perfidy to granby is repaid by unbounded generosity , which , by the way , looks more like the result of terror than of benevolence . when the mask was removed , and tyrrel 's real situation is known to the world , he is represented as wandering about the streets of london in the disguise of an old jew . his life is , consistently enough , closed by suicide . the introduction of such a character into the story , together with the many scenes of guilt and treachery , approaching more than once to the verge of murder , in which he is involved , betray a remarkable deviation from the good taste which is perceptible in other parts of this work . the activity of tyrrel throughout , and the base and furious tenor of his conduct , unredeemed by a single virtue , are not at all in keeping with the tone and manners of the circles in which he moved , nor , it may be added , of the age in which he is supposed to have lived . the interest which his profligate schemes impart to the tale , is essentially melo - dramatic ; it therefore reduces the standard , by which the work should be estimated , below that to which most probably the author aspired . in his representation of quiet , domestic , drawing - room intercourse , as well as of the bustle and heartless brilliancy of london routs , the author is peculiarly felicitous . sometimes also , as we have already intimated , he touches external scenery with a master - hand . no man has ever left a ball room at an early hour of the morning , who will not recognize the truth and beauty of the following picture . it is necessary to premise , that after a tedious separation from caroline for several months , granby met her with her mother at a rout , and learned from a bright glance that , though compelled to submit to the control of others , she did not yet forget the companion of her infancy . as they left the ball - room-- ' granby followed them with his eyes : and now too full of happiness to be accessible to any feelings of jealousy or repining , after a short reverie of the purest satisfaction , he left the ball , and sallied out into the fresh cool air of a summer - morning , suddenly passing from the red glare of lamp - light to the clear sober brightness of returning day . he walked cheerfully onward , refreshed and exhilarated by the air of [ 100/101 ] morning , and interested with the scene around him . it was broad daylight , and he viewed the town under an aspect in which it is alike presented to the late - retiring votary of pleasure , and to the early - rising sons of business . he stopped on the pavement of oxford - street to contemplate the effect . the whole extent of that long vista , unclouded by the mid - day smoke , was distinctly visible to his eye at once . the houses shrunk to half their span , while the few visible spires of the adjacent churches seemed to rise less distant than before , gaily tipped with early sunshine , and much diminished in apparent size , but heightened in distinctness and in beauty . had it not been for the cool grey tint which slightly mingled with every object , the brightness was almost that of noon . but the life , the bustle , the busy din , the flowing tide of human existence , were all wanting to complete the similitude . all was hushed and silent : and this mighty receptacle of human beings , which a few short hours would wake into active energy and motion , seemed like a city of the dead . ' there was little to break this solemn illusion . around were the monuments of human exertion , but the hands which formed them were no longer there . few , if any , were the symptoms of life . no sounds were heard but the heavy creaking of a solitary waggon : the twittering of an occasional sparrow : the monotonous tone of the drowsy watchman : and the distant rattling of the retiring carriage , fading on the ear till it melted into silence : and the eye that searched for living objects fell on nothing but the grim great - coated guardian of the night , muffled up into an appearance of doubtful character between bear and man , and scarcely distinguishable , by the colour of his dress , from the brown flags along which he sauntered . ' --vol . i. pp . 297 - 299 . though subjected to a series of disappointments and mortifications in his pursuit of caroline , yet granby was occasionally cheered by a secret intelligence , which was renewed between them as often as they met at various assemblies , and this too without the aid of verbal communication . the arts of tyrrel occasioned both a good deal of annoyance , by false representations calculated to excite their mutual jealousy . another hero was also engaged in similar practices , which seemed likely to be more fatal to granby 's hopes than the machinations of tyrrel , because they were contrived with more intriguing ingenuity , and conducted with a more specious exhibition of disinterestedness and politeness . this hero was trebeck , who is perhaps the most finished character in the novel . he is evidently a compound of one or two now antiquated beaux , who not many years ago were in the highest odour of fashion at the west end of the town . the ease of his manner , the oddity of his remarks , the temerity and good ton of his language , and his thorough mastery over every circle into which he is admitted , may be supposed to be borrowed for the occasion from a living original . the copy is excellent , though we should hope overcharged , in the unamiable traits of character which are given to trebeck . the reader may wish to see a specimen of his conversational facility . the following dialogue between him and caroline is supposed to have taken place at the dinner - table at lord daventry 's where a large party was assembled ; among them the epicurean [ 101/102 ] duke of ilminster . the passage displays the character of trebeck , and affords rather a favourable example of the author 's powers in this department of a novel . it also presents caroline in an amiable point of view . ' " by the by , " said trebeck , who sat next to caroline , " what is the dish before you ? it looks well , and i see you are eating some of it . let me recommend it to the duke upon your authority ; i dare not upon my own . " ' " then pray do not use mine . " ' " yes , i will , with your permission ; i 'll tell him you thought by what dropt from him in conversation that it would exactly suit the genius of his taste . shall i ? yes , duke , " ( raising his voice a little , and speaking across the table . ) ' " oh , no ! how can you ? " ' " why not ?-- duke , " ( with a glance at caroline ) " will you allow me to take wine with you ? " ' " i thought , " said she , relieved from her trepidation , and laughing slightly , " you would never say any thing so very strange . " ' " you have too good an opinion of me ; i blush for my unworthiness . but confess , that in fact you were rather alarmed at the idea of being held up to such a critic as the recommender of a bad dish . " ' " oh no , i was not thinking of that ; but i hardly know the duke ; and it would have seemed so odd ; and perhaps he might have thought that i had really told you to say something of that kind . " ' " of course he would ; but you must not suppose that he would have been at all surprised at it . i 'm afraid you are not aware of the full extent of your privileges , and are not conscious how many things young ladies can , and may , and will do . " ' " indeed i am not -- perhaps you will instruct me . " ' " ah , i never do that for any body . i like to see young ladies instruct themselves . it is better for them , and much more amusing to me . but , however , for once i will venture to tell you , that a very competent knowledge of the duties of women may , with proper attention , be picked up in a ball - room . " ' " then i hope , " said she , laughing , " you will attribute my deficiency to my little experience of balls . i have only been at two . " ' " only two ! and one of them i suppose a race ball . then you have not yet experienced any of the pleasures of a london season ? never had the dear delight of seeing and being seen , in a well of tall people at a rout , or passed a pleasant hour at a ball upon a staircase ? i envy you . you have much to enjoy . " ' " you do not mean that i really have ? " ' " yes really . but let me give you a caution or two . never dance with any man without first knowing his character and condition , on the word of two credible chaperons . at balls , too , consider what you come for -- to dance of course , and not to converse ; therefore , never talk yourself , nor encourage it in others . " ' " i am afraid i can only answer for myself . " ' " why , if foolish , well - meaning people will choose to be entertaining , i question if you have the power of frowning them down in a very forbidding manner : but i would give them no countenance nevertheless . " ' " your advice seems a little ironical . " [ 102/103 ] ' " oh , you may either follow it or reverse it -- that is its chief beauty . it is equally good taken either way . " ' --vol . i. pp . 93 - 95 . next to caroline , we should select general granby as our favourite --preferring him even to his youthful nephew . the old man reminds us now and then of captain absolute -- testy , impatient , affectionate , gay , and fond of his bottle . his death causes a material change in the prospects of henry , who , besides a small accession of fortune , derived from him the documents by which tyrrel 's illegitimacy was placed beyond dispute . before we quit this part of the subject , we must present the reader with the description of henry 's sudden return , after an absence of some months , to the residence of his uncle , upon hearing of his alarming illness . ' on friday about mid - day he drove into the village of ashton , and stopped at the well - remembered turn , where a bye - road led from the highway to his uncle 's house . this was situated about a quarter of a mile from the public road : and granby got out and walked to it . ' it was a fine but melancholy day : one of those which this cloudy climate rarely affords , but which , when it comes , is apt to temper our admiration with a certain feeling of gentle sadness . not a cloud was to be seen , to relieve and heighten , by its contrast , the monotonous expanse of dull , deep , greyish blue . not a breeze was heard to rustle through the trees : scarce a sound disturbed the silence , except the sky - lark twittering on high , you knew not where , and the long - drawn chirrup of the grasshopper . a thin haze which was spread over the landscape , gave a gloomy indistinctness to the distance , and deepened the flat solemnity of the dark green trees . there was a general , unrelieved , dull light ; so that , unless when looking at your own shadow , you might have almost questioned the reality of the sunshine ; and you might have thought the landscape cold , were not your ideas otherwise diverted by the enervating heat that poured down from the luminary above . ' the scene conveyed a sentiment of gloom to the mind of granby , --who perhaps was predisposed by the depressing object of his return , to seek food for melancholy . he walked on slowly , with his eyes on the ground , till , no [ sic ] turning a well - remembered corner , the house appeared immediately before him , and he raised his head to look at it . the shutters had been closed to keep out the sunshine -- which gave it a deserted air . it looked to granby like the mansion of death : and as he gazed upon the well - known window of his uncle 's room , he shuddered to think how soon he might be told , that this room contained the corpse of one so justly dear to him . ' he involuntarily stopped as the thought arose , and dreaded to advance and learn the worst : but after a brief , internal struggle , he pressed onward with a quickened pace . still he saw no face that he knew , and heard no sound familiar to him , till , as he was almost at the door , an old favourite dog of his uncle 's came bounding round the corner with a loud angry bark , which , on recognizing granby , he instantly softened into a fondling whine , and writhed himself into many an expressive gesture of greeting . ' granby could not forbear , however occupied with other thoughts , from bestowing a short caress on his first welcomer , and then looking up , saw one of the shutters partially unclosed , and a female head appear [ 103/104 ] through the chink . in an instant he was at the door , with his hand on the bell , doubtful whether he should venture to ring . he removed his hand , for he heard the low pattering of feet in the hall within : the door was carefully opened : and behind it , as he entered , was mrs. robins , the old housekeeper , with a face that struggled between pleasure at seeing him , and grief for the cause of his return . ' " is my uncle alive ? " were granby 's first words : they were uttered in a tremulous whisper . ' " ' tis all we can say , " replied mrs. robins : " but thank god , mr. henry , we can say that . " ' " i am anxious , " said he , " to see him : is he sensible ? does he expect me ? " ' " yes , sir , he does , i am pretty sure , for i told him myself that you would be back soon : and he made signs as if he understood me . but i think i had better prepare him for it , if you please , sir . will you just walk in here ? " and she opened the door of the room in which he and his uncle used to sit . ' it was almost dark , the shutters being closed to exclude the sun . he half opened one of them , and as the light poured in , looked round with mournful interest on the desolate apartment . every thing in it reminded him of times that had been , and now , he feared , never would return . there was his uncle 's chair in the spot in which he always sat , and another placed opposite , as if for himself , on the other side of the small pembroke table . on that table lay the last newespaper [ sic ] that his uncle had been reading --perhaps the last he ever would read -- marking by a day in advance the date of his first illness : and near it was an accumulation of unopened papers that had arrived since , and several sealed letters in well known hands . on the chimney - piece was a small old - fashioned clock ,-- the last appeal from all other clocks and watches in the house ,-- which his uncle , with scrupulous punctuality , always wound up with his own hand . it had now stopped -- a mute predicter of the fate of him to whose daily care it owed its motions . ' --vol . ii . pp . 284 - 287 . this is all very well told . every feature of the scene is in harmony with the melancholy occasion of granby 's visit . his uncle died the same evening , after indicating to henry where the papers were deposited by which his right to the title and estates of lord malton , upon the death of the latter , was established . this event took place shortly after , and it need scarcely be added that a corresponding change took place in the minds of sir thomas and lady jermyn , who were delighted to have for their son - in - law a peer of the realm . having observed on the melo - dramatic character of tyrrel , we shall enable the reader to judge of him from his own representation of his career . we have alluded to the generosity with which granby treated him on every occasion , and to the last ' act ' of his life , which was spent in disguise and in a wretched garret in london . here granby was induced to visit him . ' lord malton surveyed the scene with sorrow and dismay . tyrrel read his thoughts in his countenance , and seemed to participate in them . [ 104/105 ] " yes , " said he , " this is my splendour -- here i live , and there , in the sty within , i sleep . it is bad enough , but i am satisfied . we gentry accustom ourselves to many fancied indispensables , that we can do very well without . " ' " but how came you into this situation ? " said lord malton ; " i thought you meant to have gone abroad ? is not this an imprudent exposure of yourself ? " ' " there is little risk , " said tyrrel . " you can bear witness of the excellence of my disguise . and if they come to speak to me , i can puzzle them more than ever . my old cracked voice would throw them off the scent completely . yes , i sometimes walk amongst them , and take a peep behind the scenes , and see how the pigeon - trade thrives . i marched the other day into the billiard rooms in---- street . there was an old acquaintance , playing his worst to encourage a youngster -- shamming nervous . oh , i long to blow a few of them!--but it is a sorry subject for me to talk upon ,-- me that -- oh ! it drives me mad . fool , fool ! " he exclaimed , striking his forehead--"to have wrecked myself , to have sunk to this vile state , through worse than folly-- through wickedness . " ' here his voice seemed choked with emotion , and his countenance was frightfully agitated . he hid his face for a few seconds ; then raising it , and speaking in a calmer tone , " granby , " said he , " shun gambling as you would the plague . i have a right to warn you . no one better knows its pains and pleasures than myself . i have tried them thoroughly ; i have drunk the cup from the sparkling froth to the bitter dregs . people tell you that it fascinates . ay , and so does the rattlesnake . the poor bird , that is drawn within reach of the creature 's jaws , is an apt type of the growing gambler ; and the vice is scarce less deadly than the reptile . i know its pleasures well . i was a cool , calm , steady , player -- one who entered into its sober delights ; yet i have sat whole anxious hours , even when a run of luck was in my favour , with a burning brain , parched and fevered , waiting in terrible agitation for the chance of fortune that must soon come , and sweep my ill - gotten winnings from me ; yes , and envying the loser , the very loser , for having better things in prospect . this was my triumph ! these were the glories of success ! i have given you now the bright side of the picture . judge from that of the reverse . may you never know the horrid agonies of the losing gamester . i have tried that too ; and to my cost , or i should not now be sculking here . oh ! that sinking of the soul -- that struggle of the spirits -- striving , striving in vain , to bear up manfully . and then , the feeling that you must go on , and repair the past , and plunge deeper into the pit ; and the growing consciousness that you must sink , sink for ever , or fight your way through by any means -- no matter what , fair or foul ! but i am wandering , i scarce know where . madman ! " ( he muttered ) " to dwell on that!--oh , i could envy the damned ! " ' one extract more and we have done . it will be seen that we refer to it on account of the useful hint which it furnishes for the information of the fair portion of the creation . we should add that courtenay was another of granby 's friends , who was also his rival for the affections of caroline . his attentions were encouraged by lady jermyn , who , as she ' liked to be civil to young people , ' gave him a cordial invitation to brackingsley , the family seat . [ 105/106 ] ' courtenay accepted the invitation with great alacrity . not that he felt much pleasure in the society of either lady jermyn or sir thomas , or was much flattered by their notice of him . the attraction lay elsewhere : it was " the one fair daughter which he loved passing well . " he had begun to admire caroline in town , and thought of her as seriously as could reasonably be expected , considering that he had never met her but in the anti - matrimonial atmosphere of a london ball - room . ' his admiration thus awakened , began to ripen fast into attachment , now that he saw her in the less dazzling , but more seductive sphere of her domestic circle . hers were gentle timid graces which such a situation called forth ; and in these consisted her greatest charm . courtenay could not long regard her in this attractive point of view , without being deeply struck with the many captivating points of her character ; her unvaried sweetness of temper , natural , unforced cheerfulness , and perfect freedom from affectation . he saw her now in that situation where woman 's power is most deeply felt --where alone she may expect to win the heart of a man of sense . ' it is not amid the gay distractions of a crowded party , or the lively prattle of the dance -- though with beauty heightened by the aid of brilliant lights , of costly jewels , and all the pride of millinery , that her influence is most powerfully experienced . it is in the quiet interchange of that domestic species of society , in which display has less power to enter , and in which the sterling qualities of the mind have fuller leisure to expand.'--vol . iii . pp . 86 , 87 . this is the language of good sense ; for a few more such passages we should willingly exchange a vast quantity of the small talk which incumbers this work . such persiflage may be amusing enough , when nothing better can be had , in a round conversation sustained by six or seven persons . but reduce it to writing , the sparkle vanishes , and the spirit which gave it buoyancy becomes insipid . notes : format : 3 vols 8vo . publisher : colburn ._. _ _ given the number of applications that have � passed through ' my pda in the last few months i was not surprised to find that the type and number of files and preferences held in its internal memory appeared to be growing at an alarming rate . every piece of software written for palmos seems to leave some small part of itself behind on deletion without any means of being identified or dealt with . the discovery of uninstall manager and cleanup from northglide systems , therefore , came as a great relief to me . updated since their last outing in a pda24/7 review , these utilities help you monitor what 's going - on on your pda , enabling you to properly maintain only those applications you require and helping you remove the remnants of everything else . uninstall manager for those unfamiliar with uninstall manager , its core purpose is fairly straightforward . it sits quietly on your device recording the details of every preference , setting and file created by each application you have installed . the point of doing this , of course , is to maintain a full record of all the bits and pieces of software and data associated with every application so that when you choose to delete something , all the attributes and files that have been used by it get deleted as well . on the face of it , this is a good deal . while palmos operates on the basis of unique user ids as a means of identifying files with their parent application , not all applications follow this convention to the letter . what this means is that over time , if left to itself , your device will collect a growing set of orphaned preferences and files taking up memory that could be more effectively used for something else . by gathering all of this data together and associating it with the parent , within its own database , uninstall manager ensures that you are able to maximize the available facilities of your handheld device . in use , the main screen displays a list of all your current applications on one side with the details of the program and the associated preferences and files on the other , utilising the full size of a hi - res+ display and allowing good use of a 5-way navigator if available . this information effectively tells you what will be removed from your device if you uninstall the selected application . the associations between preferences , files and applications can be made in a number of ways depending on the specific application and the way it works . the simplest method of association is the set of unique ids used by the core os as already described . any file or preference tagged with an id used by one of your applications is automatically recorded as associated with it . ( the ids themselves are recorded and managed by palmsource to ensure their uniqueness is maintained and thus they are a fairly good way of ensuring that associated items are correctly grouped ) . where common ids are not used , the monitoring process described in the overview will track which application is running at the time any new file or preference is created and an application association is made based on that data . where the system misses a file link entirely , which it does very rarely i 've found , you can create an association manually between the desired items by grouping them together . this is a new facility in the latest release , i believe , which operates by presenting you with a list of available files from which you may select as many as you require and manually group them together . i think this approach could be particularly useful in the case where a single application comprises multiple executable . prc files ( for example ) . you can specify certain applications as being ignored by the automatic association process if you need to � a utility such as filez would be a good candidate for this feature as it has the potential to manipulate just about any file on your device without any of them actually having anything to do with the filez application itself . specifying this as being ignored will prevent the corruption of your association database that may otherwise result . as well as the association database , uninstall manager has one final clever trick up its sleeve . it monitors all hotsync operations and stores details of the applications and files installed at each one . when an application is deleted , this list is scanned and any additional files or applications installed at the same time are offered for deletion on the assumption that they may be related to the item you are removing . i must emphasise that they are only offered for deletion and you may decline the offer if you wish - installing multiple applications at one hotsync is clearly a possibility . this feature is actually one that i had n't understood from the documentation but discovered accidentally when deleting a demo application ( for review ) prior to installing the full version of the software . its suggestion of a companion file for deletion was correct and saved me the time required to find it , but more importantly it saved me the space i would have lost had i left the extra application files on my t3 following the deletion . it is worth pointing out that with the registered version of the software , you do not actually need to use uninstall manager itself to delete your applications and all the associated data . if the ' work in background ' option is selected in the settings window , this utility will monitor applications being removed from your handheld by the os as well as those being installed . if a deletion is detected , uninstall manager will respond by giving you the opportunity to delete all of the associated files and preferences as if you had used uninstall manager itself to perform the operation . i must confess that i have n't tried this aspect of the software personally as i 'm quite happy deleting things from within the utility but it gives a sense of reassurance that all that monitoring and linking will not be wasted if i go and delete something from elsewhere . having described the core function of uninstallation , there is one final aspect to this software worth mentioning and that is the sandbox facility . if you wish to try a new application but are unsure of the impact it will have on your device or its configuration , the sandbox is an effective way of finding out . it effectively segregates an area of memory and installs your new application temporarily to that area . this software can then be run and tested in this isolated environment and the impact it has on your machine can be gauged . if you do n't like it , a simple tap will remove it and everything it created - the sandbox is raked clean to use an appropriate metaphor . if you do like your new application , tapping a different button will allow you to install it permanently . it 's a very effective way of trying something out without risk of corrupting anything else in memory . cleanup cleanup is an application with a different but complimentary job to that of its sibling , as unless you 're very lucky , you probably wo n't get to install uninstall manager on your brand new device before any other applications are downloaded to it . what cleanup does , to help in this scenario , is scan through any pre - existing databases and preferences and highlight those that it does not believe are associated with an existing application . there might initially be a quite a lot of these , especially if you 've had your device for some time and used a lot of applications but cleanup has further functions to help you whittle this list down . the chief of these is the signature file . this is a list of files and preferences maintained by northglide and updated , effectively , by the users of uninstall manager and cleanup . for each item , the list details the application with which it is actually associated so that cleanup is able to tag otherwise unidentified files and preferences with their source application details . given this detail , it is then fairly simple to determine whether that application is one you are still using and so delete the preference as appropriate ( or not ! ) and recover any wasted space . it 's not an infallible system , particularly where a file is used by more than one application in a developer 's suite of software , but it does fill a hole in what would otherwise be an almost impossible task . even after the signature file has been used to identify as many of your possibly orphaned items as possible , there will still be some that remain unidentified . in my usual cavalier fashion , i took these and simply deleted them from my device and then started playing with my application suite to see what had been broken . while this is not the recommended approach , cleanup does cater for it in that it creates a backup copy of those items deleted through the application . thus , if you do end up in problems as a result , you can easily restore the required preference or file and end up back where you started . as an example of this , one of the unidentified preferences on my device was , in fact , the registration detail for mobiledb - as i found out when i next went to run the application . while i do have a record of my registration data , it was much easier just to restore the missing preference than to open up various applications and files to recover the missing code . analysis as utilities go , these are very useful � there is no doubt about it . i do n't know how much space i have saved by installing them , but the saving is significant ( i wonder whether it is more space than they actually use themselves ? ) . cleanup pinpointed a number of unused items and the signature file correctly identified most of them for me allowing me to delete those i no longer required . for the others , the � safe delete ' mode offered by cleanup provided a simple method of trying to do without them without actually removing them completely . that is just the sort of safety feature that is crucial in applications of this type , in my opinion . without it , i would still have deleted my � extra ' preferences ; i just would n't have been able to restore them so easily once i had worked which application needed them . the interface to both utilities is clear and the functionality fairly well defined such that , in use , the software is fairly simple to manage . that 's what this sort of application requires , of course , as no - one buys a pda in order to run software to manage the content of their pda ! file management will always be a maintenance task and as such needs to be able to be completed as quickly and simply as possible . these applications manage to meets that requirement in my opinion . i 'm impressed with the behaviour of the suite when an application is installed to a card . if you 've read the review , you 'll know i 've recently had gagarin 's mission installed on my sd card . this installation also installs a number of files in the main memory of the device . my expectation was that cleanup would identify these as orphans and offer to � handle ' them for me but it did n't , correctly identifying the data as being associated with the game even though it was installed elsewhere . removing the card suddenly caused them to be orphaned and they were then correctly highlighted as such . one slight wrinkle i 've found relates to the beaming of applications between pdas . when a file is received via ir ( and presumable any form of communication other than hotsync ) , uninstall manager will associate it with whatever application happened to have last been running on the device at the time the file was received . i guess this is a ' best guess ' assumption that that application was the creator of the new file as this is all the data that the software has to work with . it 's not a big problem but needs to be borne in mind if you are in the habit of beaming files between pdas and plan to use uninstall manager . i must admit to some hesitation over the potential ( ab ) uses of these utilities . given that a lot of the palmos software market runs on the basis of timed software demo 's , enabling ' try before you buy ' , any utility such as these that enable you to remove all traces of an application can also allow abuse of the demo system by artificially prolonging the demo period . having said that , however , using the utilities in this way while possible , quickly becomes annoying ( yes i have tried it ) and longer - term quickly becomes impractical or just too much bother . conclusions negative spin aside , uninstall manager and cleanup between them have done a good job of clearing up my t3 and reducing its contents to those items i really need to run the applications i have installed either for personal use or evaluation and review . i never get really excited about utilities as they will never be a core requirement for my use of a pda but that said , these programs have surprised me and done not only what i expected of them but more besides . as such , i would recommend them highly if you are looking to tidy up some of the rubbish left behind on your pda ._. _ _ sugar mummies , which plays at the octagon as part of the royal court 's 50th anniversary celebrations , is a new light -

packaged goods . packages must be marked with the weight or volume of the contents . packers and importers must comply with three important rules : the contents of packages must on average not be less than the amount marked on the label ( known as the nominal quantity ) . not more than one package in forty may contain less than the nominal quantity by more than an amount called the tolerable negative error ( tne ) . this varies according to the nominal quantity e.g. 9 g on a 250 g pack . such packages are called � non - standard � . no packages may contain less than the nominal quantity by more than twice the tne . these are called � inadequate packages � . the packer or importer must keep quantity control records and must produce these to a trading standards officer on request . a retailer only commits an offence when knowingly possessing for sale or selling an inadequate package . does the system cover all packages ? no . it applies to all goods listed in the weights and measures ( packaged goods ) regulations 1979 in packages made up to a pre - determined constant quantity e.g. packages of cheddar cheese made up to a nominal quantity of 250 g are included , but packs of the same cheese marked with whatever weights they happen to contain ( i.e. catchweights ) are outside the average system . such packs continue to be covered by the traditional minimum system , and must contain at least the stated quantity . the goods caught include paint , soap , solid fuel and most types of food . certain items such as ice cream , cakes and fresh fruit and vegetables are excluded , as are goods used in processing and very small and very large packages . packages not included in the system may be voluntarily brought into it if they are within the range 5g/5ml to 10kg/101 and are � e � marked ( see below ) . who is the packer ? a packer is a person who places goods into packages . however , this may not necessarily be the person named on the package , or the person whose brand or trade mark appears on the label . a person who packs under contract for a large chain of supermarkets is the packer and must meet all the legal duties . what are the packer � s duties ? a packer � s main duty is to ensure that packages will pass a special statistical test called a � reference test � . this is conducted by trading standards officers and shows whether the packer complies with the three rules . packers must also : make up all their packages on equipment listed in the regulations , or check regular samples of the packages using equipment listed in the regulations and keep a record of the checks for one year . the packer has a duty to mark the packages legibly and permanently with the nominal quantity and the name and address of the packer or the person arranging for the packing to be done , or a mark which will enable an inspector to identify the packer . does a packer have to pack to average ? there is no requirement to pack to the tolerances permitted under the � average system � and it is quite permissible to continue working to the � minimum system � . however , packers of average system products who choose to pack on a minimum basis must either make up every package on prescribed equipment , or check samples and keep records . in general , less checking is needed when packages are systematically overpacked . this can be an advantage where the goods are relatively inexpensive . who is an importer ? the law defines an importer as the � person by whom or on whose behalf the package is entered for customs purposes on importation � . a person who brings , for example , canned fruit into the uk which it is intended will be sold through wholesalers is the importer . if the same person brings cans into the country on behalf of a supermarket chain , then the supermarket chain is the importer . however , a person who brings packages into the uk from other ec member states bearing the � e � mark is not treated as an importer . what are the importer � s duties ? importers are responsible for the quantity contained in packages and for ensuring they are correctly marked . in addition , importers have a duty either to carry out checks to confirm the quantity and keep a record of the checks for one year , or to obtain certification documents in order to provide an adequate guarantee of quantity . certification documents must be either : records of checks carried out overseas on the packages , or a certificate from the overseas weights and measures authority that they operate controls equivalent to the average system , or a declaration from the overseas packer that the packages have been packed to the minimum system . the � e � mark the � e � mark is a special symbol which look like this : it must be at least 3 mm high and appear in the same field of vision as the statement of nominal quantity . the mark constitutes a guarantee by the packer or importer that a package to which it is applied has been made up in accordance with the average system . it acts as a metrological passport throughout the european community . there are restrictions on its use and in most cases packers or importers who intend to export � e � marked goods must notify their local weights and measures authority . local authorities may exempt packers and importers from this obligation and they should always be contacted before the � e � mark is first applied to packages . trading standards officers trading standards officers are responsible for enforcing the average quantity laws . trading standards officers systematically visit packers � and importers � premises testing equipment , checking packages and examining records . such checks on packages at source are more effective than those carried out randomly at retail level and also enables officers to more easily monitor difficult products such as aerosols and bottled goods . in a typical year over 35,000 , average quantity reference tests are carried out by officers . the average failure rate is around 6 % - this figure has improved every year since the introduction of the system . the principle of the home authority this principle involves a system whereby any business , irrespective of its size or number of outlets , may look for guidance to a single enforcement authority . this is normally the home authority where a business headquarters are based or where find labelling , advertising , quantity or quality control decisions are taken . an index of home authorities is available from the address below . this advice is designed to provide basic guidance to traders . it is not a complete authoritive statement of the law . for further assistance on this or any other trading standards legislation , please contact your nearest office . we will be pleased to offer this information in larger print or translated into any language on request ._. _ _ brian rutherford concludes his series of articles on new developments in financial management over the past few months i have commented on a variety of new developments in financial management . i have examined the move to scrap the budget ( a&b , september 2000 ) ; abc ( a&b , october 2000 ) ; value - based management ( a&b , november / december 2000 ) ; economic resource planning ( a&b , january 2001 ) ; and the balanced scorecard ( a&b , march 2001 ) . in each case i have been critical of aspects of the model underlying the new development . but i have not been arguing that modern techniques of financial management are valueless . rather , i have been suggesting that they are best seen , not as radical breaks with the past , but as evolutionary developments building on existing professional disciplines and expertise . in this respect i am at odds with many promoters of the new techniques , who characterise what the creators/ formulators are offering as revolutionary advances in thinking . i have also set out to show that , although they usually represent an improvement in approach on previous incarnations , the new techniques often retain at least some of the problems associated with earlier models in the evolutionary chain - the difference being that these problems are not now discussed so openly and honestly as before because of the circumstances under which techniques are marketed . had i wanted to strain the patience of my readers , the series of articles could have gone on for several months longer at least by considering , for example : what are product profitability analysis and target costing but developments of the value engineering already well understood in the 1950s ? is keeping a close eye on competitors ( or competitor accounting , as it is now known ) really novel ? i can certainly remember the day , soon after joining the headquarters of a major multi - national in the early 1970s , when i was shown the office in which were kept filing cabinets full of information about our main competitors . many multi - nationals are moving to create financial shared service centres , bringing together financial data processing , cash and treasury management , external reporting and other functions from numerous geographically diverse sites around the world to a small number of centralised locations . this development parallels the concentration of uk bookkeeping functions carried out by many multi - site firms between 1930 and the late 1950s , to take advantage of the economies of scale offered by mechanised methods . these were often reversed when difficulties of communication and co - ordination undermined the benefits of scale . it will be interesting to see whether the move to global concentration is similarly reversed as the reality of the challenges posed by routine global communication ( both electronic and cultural ) emerge . recent trends in remuneration systems towards " incentivisation " represent the adoption for knowledge workers of the payment - by - results and bonus systems operated for manual workers since time immemorial . since the 1950s , however , these have been regarded by many leading - edge employers as counterproductive because of perceived inequity and the adoption of social mechanisms designed to break " rate busting " by the groups the system was supposed to control . in this article i want to ask if there are any general lessons for financial management to be learned from the cases i have been examining . some consultants and gurus promoting these works claim ( or at least imply ) that those ideas are major advances if not , indeed , revolutionary paradigm shifts . they will thus tend to understate the connections between the idea of the writers and what has gone before : vbm supporters do not cite work on residual income ; disciples of the balanced scorecard do not refer to the contributions to the literature made by david solomons and others writing 30 years before kaplan and norton . at one level this can be seen merely as the inevitable and relatively innocent consequence of the usual market puff and spin . at other levels , however , there could be serious consequences for those who adopt the techniques and for the discipline of financial management itself . any newly developed mechanism may turn out to contain flaws not envisaged at the time it is unveiled - progress is impossible unless we are willing to accept some risk of this kind . but if those who market the device ignore its connections with previous work , they are failing to make use of a valuable source of guidance about potential problems . if vbm is seen as a development from residual income , we are immediately alerted to the dangers arising in the face of non - uniform earnings streams and capital constraints . equally , if the balanced scorecard is treated as a further sophistication of thinking initially developed by solomons and others , we are naturally drawn to examine the problematic relationship between non - financial measures and profitability and the trade - offs likely to be needed to balance the scorecard . misleading signals a similar danger arises if the marketing of a technique as a revolution in thinking results in the links with the relevant literature being severed . an obvious case here is the failure of much of the literature supporting the use of abc to point out that the model may yield misleading signals where , as in many settings featuring new technologies , there are substantial levels of non - separable costs . another example is the susceptibility of the handelsbanken model of budget - less management to the anti - rate busting co - operation between apparently independent actors identified in the hawthorne experiments . a further consequence of the tendency to promote new techniques as revolutionary is the creation of an impression that they must be adopted " all or nothing " , without the possibility of selecting parts of the new system or piloting it before making a full - scale commitment . for many of these new techniques , adoption will involve heavy costs - directly ( in terms of the resources needed , or because legacy systems must be abandoned , with all the risks associated with such a move ) or because wider systems need to be re - engineered . this is true , for example , of abc ( because costing systems must be re - engineered ) and erp ( where there are both direct costs of acquiring the necessary software and training staff in its use as well as risks from abandoning legacy systems ) . the apparent need for an " all or nothing " approach may put off companies , especially smes , who as a result lose the benefits that could come from partial implementation . lost opportunities the failure to locate innovative techniques within a wider disciplinary context may result in the loss of opportunities to exploit related developments as well as , or instead of , the technique itself . for example , failure to appreciate that the refocusing of strategy that may accompany the implementation of erp can be separated from the adoption of the software itself may result in the possibility of refocusing strategy being rejected because the package is too expensive . so far , we have been examining the problems that may face organisations adopting ( or deciding not to adopt ) new techniques . i want to turn now to explore the dangers that the way in which these new techniques are promoted cause for the discipline of financial management itself . because each new technique is often / commonly promoted as a near - magical , revolutionary advance that will overcome all the problems from which existing approaches suffer , the reputation of financial management as a broad discipline is undermined . how can a subject so full of holes so easily fixed by the latest guru be worth the title of a discipline at all ; how can its practitioners merit respect ; and how can it be worth studying ? for every balanced book or article examining the weaknesses as well as the strengths of the new approach , there are a hundred glib pieces presenting it as a comprehensive , simple and speedy fix for all the flaws in current methods . hence , the reluctance of practitioners to adopt the technique ( remember that only one - third of those companies considering the use of abc in 1994 had actually adopted the system by 2000 ) is likely to be attributed to conservatism and abhorrence of change . a proper consideration of the weaknesses and snags associated with an innovatory method often suggests that practitioners � scepticism is justified , but those who use and rely on the expertise of financial managers - other managers and stakeholders in the business - may never appreciate this . hence , public confidence in the core discipline of financial management falls . of course , since the new technique will inevitably be imperfect , the gloss will sooner or later wear off and stakeholders who were sold it as a leading - edge solution will feel let down . it would be nice to think that they will then remember the caution of professional financial managers and adjust their estimation of the value of the discipline accordingly . sadly , it is more likely that stakeholders will blame finance staff for the failure . there will be pressure to find yet another innovation to fix the flaws in the previous one and the sorry cycle will be repeated . accountants will lose confidence in the solid core of their discipline and become " guru junkies" � a development all too painfully visible in some other areas of management . students will lose confidence in the curriculum , concentrating on new and exciting material and ignoring the basics of their subject . i believe that it is time for accountants to reclaim financial management . the movement to inject some scepticism into the way new techniques are treated is well underway in other areas - see for example eileen shapiro � s fad surfing in the boardroom : reclaiming the courage to manage in the age of instant answers ( capstone , 1996 ) and the , rather more academic , study , management redeemed : debunking the fads that undermine our corporations by frederick hilmer and lex donaldson ( free press , 1996 ) . hilmer and donaldson � s conclusion is that management must professionalise itself : " the essence of professional management is the skilful application of sound and proven ideas to the particular situations facing the manager - not dogma , jargon or quick - fix fads " ( p.172 ) . fortunately , accountancy long ago went through the process of professionalisation but it must now reassert its professionalism and resist what hilmer and donaldson call the " instant coffee " approach to problems . brian rutherford is professor of accounting at canterbury business school , university of kent . he is an acca council member ._. _ _ sing , prance , ruffle , bellow , bristle and ooze armand marie leroi this article originally appeared in the london review of books , 17 september 1998 over the past three years , the london school ot economics has been holding a seminar series , or rather a salon , snappily titled darwin@lse . these seminars are always invigorating , and never more so than one evening this february when wg runciman urged the necessity of refounding sociology along darwinian lines . weary of such pronouncements though they might be , even the most sceptical sociologists could not have failed to realise that here was a serious challenge to theoretical orthodoxy . for the speaker was no renegade entomologist , but the author of a treatise of social theory , arguably the most deeply considered and formidable exposition of historical sociology in recent times and one , moreover , that rests on a darwinian view of society . but as runciman , the most courtly of men , argued his case with wit , clarity and the utmost intellectual candour , i found myself engaged with a nagging question : who is his tailor ? for he was not dressed as were the other academics present , what with the faultless lines of his suit , the softness of the fabric ( visible at 40 feet ) , the dove grey shirt , the soberly elegant tie , and all of it without stain or crease , suggesting another dozen of each in a walk - in closet at home . quietly and unmistakably , that suit spoke of money and influence . why did runciman wear it ? because he had evidently come to the lse directly from his important day job in the city , and suits of understated perfection are the necessary uniform of such men . [ garry runciman had something to say about this . ] why , though ; are such suits necessary at all ? this question was answered in 1890 by thorstein veblen in his theory of the leisure class , where he had something to say about men 's dress as about virtually all human artefacts : much of the charm that invests the patent leather shoe , the stainless linen , the lustrous cylindrical hat , and the walking stick , which so greatly enhances the native dignity of a gentleman , comes of their pointedly suggesting that the wearer can not when so attired bear a hand in any employment that is directly and immediately of any human use . beautiful clothes are the most obvious form of what veblen called conspicuous waste . it is not my intention , however , to pillory runciman 's taste in clothes , for , as veblen shows at exhaustive length , conspicuous waste forms part of almost any aesthetic decision ; it is almost , but not quite , the whole of beauty . a life without conspicuous waste is hardly imaginable , and certainly not one worth leading . the curious thing is that animals think so , too . take stotting . a troop of gazelles which has just detected the presence of a predator might be expected to slink quietly off into the undergrowth , or perhaps bound gracefully in the opposite direction . not a bit of it . instead , the antelopes bark , thump the ground with their hooves and stot , i.e. jump up and down while displaying their white rumps and whirling black tails to their aggressor . only when the predator begins its strike do the gazelles pick up and run . this is the sort of thing that amotz and avishag zahavi , two biologists from tel aviv university , call a ' handicap ' : a behaviour or structure which seemingly defies darwinian rationality . a stotting gazelle wastes energy that might surely be better used in flight ; it also draws attention to itself precisely when discretion would seem to be the better part of valour . such handicaps are apparently ubiquitous when one creature attempts to convey information to another . the dawn chorus may enchant or irritate at 4 a.m. but , if it irritates you , spare a thought for the singers , who are exhausting themselves in the effort . as is the kudu , when it wields its enormous horns , or the lyrebird wagging its fantastic tail , or the great bustard , in its elaborate dance to entice a mate or deter a rival ; everywhere , when animals signal they are seemingly wasteful of their time and energy and running the risk of death . that , say the zahavis in the handicap principle , is the whole point . when animals ( and plants and fungi ) sing , prance , ruffle , bellow , bristle or ooze , they are advertising their own darwinian fitness , enticing those who desire to mate , deterring those who seek to subjugate , and dissuading those who simply see them as food . when stotting , the insouciant gazelle signals to the predator that it has vigour to spare , and will almost certainly elude an attempted strike ; far better that the canny predator should try another antelope stotting with less conviction , or not at all . it 's all pure veblen . the elaborate signals displayed by so many creatures are conspicuous waste , the biological analogue of any luxury good : useless , even harmful , but an indispensable index to money in the bank . the zahavis are not the first to see meaning in animal signals , but no one before has seen as much meaning , or claimed with such conviction to understand it . in the ' handicap ' principle they have found an interpretative tool that reveals significance in the most obscure phenomena . even baker 's yeast , when choosing a mate , is credited with subtle discrlminatory powers of a type that one would not normally expect from a fungus . the revolutionary import of the zahavis ' view is well illustrated by their discussion of that touchstone for evolutionary biologists , the peacock 's tail . for the zahavis , each feature of the peacock 's courtship display - the shimmering colours of the tail , the posture in which it is held , the way it is shaken , the roaring and stamping - are all there to proclaim male vitality , for it is only the healthiest birds that can display a perfect tail and bear the costs of doing so . even the eyespots are claimed to be uniquely suited to advertising male quality , for they will show imperfections to a degree that simpler geometries would not . this is quite different from darwin 's own view . in the descent of man and selection in relation to sex ( 1871 ) he argued that the peacock 's tail , like all aesthetic traits , was essentially arbitrary in form . females , perhaps because of some cognitive quirk , tended to favour males with certain attributes , say , a slightly more elaborate tail . male tails and female choice would then evolve in tandem , mutually reinforcing each other , by a process that darwin 's successors called ' runaway sexual selection ' . if the peacock 's tail speaks of anything , it speaks only of the peculiarities of female psychology , a love of beauty for beauty 's sake , and nothing of male quality . indeed , it is just as likely that sexual selection would sometimes result in the evolution of very small tails . who is right ? it is difficult to know . the handicap principle is a work of advocacy rather than a judicious review of the evidence . the problem is that discriminating between different evolutionary explanations for animal communication requires careful measurement of the costs and benefits to both those who are broadcasting the signal and those who are listening , and such measurements are difficult to make . yet there is no denying that the zahavis ' view is compelling , drawing our attention to things that we would not expect to find otherwise in animals . that generosity can have earthly rewards is a commonplace . veblen explained dissipation among journeyman printers in 19th - century america as a consequence of their ' treating ' each other to endless rounds of drinks in order to gain prestige . more unexpected is that the babbler , a small bird that lives in hierarchical groups , does much the same thing . members of a group vie for the right to feed nestlings , undertake guard duty , even attack snakes . none is more eager in the performance of these duties than the dominant bird ; were it not , it would lose face and be at risk of a coup d' � tat . in short , ' conspicuous waste ' and the ' handicap principle ' represent a remarkable convergence between sociological and evolutionary theory . even more remarkable is that for once the sociologists got there first . the thesis of runciman 's new book , the social animal , is one that can be stated very simply . sociology is both a science and an evolutionary science . how you take this will depend on who you are . if you are among the many theoretical sociologists with a distaste for ' positivist sociology ' , then the brisk common sense of this little book will have no appeal . but if you are , as i am , a natural scientist who has despaired of finding a sociologist whose thought is deeply infused with what is sometimes called ( though not by scientists , who do n't talk about such things ) the ' scientific temper ' then you will read this book with a sense of blessed relief . by the ' scientific temper ' , i mean the taking for granted of those methods which natural scientists have used to such good effect , and the assumption that they can be applied to the study of human societies . thus the statistical devices that might be used to study conflict and coercion within , say , the british labour party can , in large part , be applied with equal facility to a colony of naked mole rats . many sociologists see it differently , however . backbenchers , they might say , are self - conscious in a way that mole rats are not ; they are capable of explaining their own actions . but so what ? asks runciman . ' the ! kung of the kalahari are as aware as the professors and graduate students who study them of the function of meat - sharing in reinforcing their social ties . but the function would be the same even if they were n't . ' ah , replies the sociologist , but humans are also reflexive - they can respond to what others say or do - especially sociologists . but again , this makes the study of human society no more difficult than that of many natural systems in which the behaviour of some entity ( atom , molecule , cell , tissue , a mole rat ) depends on what other entities like it do . nothing is more reflexive than the way we earn , save and spend our money , yet this does n't seem to fuss economists , who accommodate such behaviour quite comfortably within systems of differential equations . the problem seems to be that , for reasons peculiar to the history of their discipline , many sociologists take a rather provincial view of natural science , as a search for ' general laws ' . general laws are , without a doubt , nice , if you can find them , but the business of scientists is to explain the particular as well as the universal ; to understand things that are true for one moment in history , and other things that are true for all time ; to supply facts that are beyond dispute , and disputes for which there are ( as yet ) no facts . a grab - bag of activities , but somehow all of it science . the methodological relativist may ask : what . then , is n't science ? the answer is plain : most intellectual goods , and in particular , the goods purveyed by the merchants of attitude and platitude . attitude merchants are , in runciman 's words , those sociologists ' who allow their personal views about the behaviour they are studying to inform their conclusions about it to the point that they neglect or devalue uncomfortable evidence for the sake of those views . ' they are legion , but runciman singles out the current president of the international sociological association , immanuel wallerstein , for having devoted his life to understanding the relative wealth of nations even though he ' hates capitalism . . . like a sunni muslim hates a shiite muslim , or a freemason a jesuit , or a rangers supporter a celtic one . ' that would n't matter , except that this hatred has , according to runciman , blinded wallerstein to facts which do not fit his neo - marxist theory of transnational economic exploitation . it is the platitude merchants , however , who have been the true plague of 20th - century sociology : those sociologists ' who allow their conviction of the importance of some general truths about human behaviour to convince them that by rephrasing those truths in more impressive sounding words - or , sometimes , more impressive looking but nonetheless trivial mathematical equations - they are advancing sociological knowledge . ' here runciman picks on talcott parsons , echoing c. wright mills 's memorable skewering of the harvard sociologist 's mock profundities . but he might just as well have picked on a fresher target , j � rgen habermas , say . still , this surely hints that runciman intends the social animal to do what mills 's the sociological imagination did nearly forty years ago : capture the hearts and minds of generations of sociologists yet unborn . he intends to capture them for darwin . he will , i think , succeed , and for a simple reason : the minimal requirements for darwinian evolution are so few and are found everywhere . consider a group of ' things ' . if these ' things ' vary in some way , reproduce more or less faithfully , and some variants reproduce more than others , then the ' things ' will evolve . if the ' things ' are dna molecules , or genes , then we are in the familiar world of biological evolution . but they can be ideas as well - love of one 's country ; the refrain of mandalay ; the infallible cure for athlete 's foot : all reproduce when passed from one person to another . richard dawkins has called such reproducing ideas ' memes ' . runciman 's insight has been to see that darwinian ' things ' can also be whatever occurs when an individual finds him or herself to be a member of a group . what then occurs are ' social practices ' , defined by runciman as ' reciprocal behaviour[s ] informed by mutual recognition of shared intentions and beliefs ' . a nice example is the system of infantry drill invented by maurits of nassau , stadtholder of holland and zeeland from 1585 . this drill was a reciprocal behaviour in that officers commanded and soldiers obeyed , and all understood what was wanted : marching and counter - marching in lockstep to the rattle of drums . it was hugely effective and , along with a series of other military innovations , brought the young maurits repeated triumphs against the spanish in the 1590s . the innovations caught on and spread rapidly among european armies , displacing other ways of ordering soldiers in battle . in other words , the social practice of war evolved . if the argument seems obvious , that 's because runciman has simply formalised the way in which we normally think about such things . what really drives social evolution ? the answer to this rests on three other questions . first , how do novel social practices originate ? second , how are they transmitted among their ' carriers ' ( commonly known as people ) ? third , what is the selective agent , or , why is one practice chosen over another ? runciman is coy about answering these questions but rightly so , for the practices are so diverse that they can not be easily summarised in the kinds of simple rules that genetics gives to biological evolution , and the charm of his theory is its generality . variation in social practices may arise as the conscious invention of great men , or as unthinking behavioural changes occurring in countless anonymous souls . such variants may be entirely new or combinations of existing practices ; the analogy is with genetic mutation and recombination respectively . their transmission , the analogue of mendelian inheritance , is equally diverse . some may be transmitted from parent to child , others may be disseminated by the lrb . an especially interesting factor , not shared by genes , is that their transmission can be influenced by inequalities in power . that is , in a hierarchical society , some people ( employers , officers , politicians , bureaucrats ) can make us adopt certain practices against our will , while other people can influence us in more subtle ways . to the degree that those born in liberal democracies are subject to what tocqueville called the ' orderly , gentle , peaceful slavery ' of the state , there need be no more potent force driving social evolution . this leaves open the question , if we are free up to a point to choose among social practices , what do we care about ? runciman 's answer is power - economic , ideological , coercive or some combination of them . i am not sure that this is always so , however . sociobiologists , who like to study such topics as polygamy , homicide and incest , might argue that certain social practices , like genes , are favoured for their influence on reproductive success ; economists , on the other band ; see us as maximising ' utility ' . but it really does n't matter : the logic of social selection is the same , and reproductive success , utility and the various forms of power are closely related ; which is uppermost in our minds when we decide what to do remains a question for psychologists , and a very interesting one . just as darwin was by no means original in viewing life 's diversity as the outcome of descent by modification , so there are social evolutionists by the score behind runciman . but darwin 's originality lay in providing a mechanism for evolution and exploring its consequences , and so does runciman 's . one such consequence is that there is no place in his account for the idea , dear to comte , spencer and marx ( to name but three ) , that social evolution necessarily proceeds in a particular direction , through particular stages , perhaps even to greater moral heights . quite possibly societies do evolve as stage theorists say they do , but that is a matter of contingent history and does not stem from the logic of the selective process itself . as for the moral worth of one society or social practice as against another , ' that ' , as runciman puts it , ' is up to you . ' all this serves to damp the powder of his potential opponents , particularly the current director of the lse , anthony giddens , who has long insisted that there is no place in sociology for the concept of evolution . this , runciman remarks , ' is as sensible as insisting that there is no place in physical theory for the concept of gravity ' , and after reading the social animal one can but agree . indeed , it is easy to see how the social scientist who seeks to understand the causes of a social phenomenon , be it group fission in the yanomami , state formation in madagascar , the homicide rate of new york city , polygamy in the mormons or the political radicalisation of british foxhunters seeks , in essence , to understand why one practice rather than another spreads in society . powerful though runciman 's ideas may be , it is also the case that evolutionary dynamics - whether biological or social -are far more complex and subtle in their causes and consequences than mere english can capture . evolutionary biologists have known this since the thirties , when darwinism , at the time all but moribund , was reborn in mathematical form . in the so - called neo - darwinian synthesis . this was , and is , a tool of great power and formal beauty which allows the consequences of evolutionary forces to be examined with precision . the theory of social selection now requires something like it . runciman convinces us that societies have evolved , illustrates how they may have done so and provides the elementaiy logic of social selection . this is a grand scheme but far from a predictive and testable theoty of social evolution ; for that , a mathematical account of the origin , transmission and selection of social practices is required . founded on the established mathematics of natural selection , such a theory would have a good start in life , but since there are many more instances of the darwinian dynamic in society than in organic life , the infant would swiftly outstrip its parent .. a successful theory would constitute nothing less than a universal formal language for sociology . then we could truly say that darwin lives @lse . garry runciman had this to say about his suit : 15 september . at last a review , and a flattering one , of the social animal in the lrb by armand leroi . but why does he use up precious column - inches talking about the suit i wore when i gave a seminar on the theme of the book at the lse ? i do n't remember wearing a suit at all . but if i did , it will have been my nondescript austin reed loss - leader , not the dark blue tailormade pinstripe which i keep for telling the shareholders to forget about a dividend this year . much ribaldry is caused among my family , by whom i am regularly pilloried for my tragic lack of sartorial sense , pig - headed indifference to fashion , and pitiful attachment to short socks and boring ties . i do n't need a professor of semiotics to tell me that clothes send a message . but what are those of us who do n't have a message to send supposed to wear ? perhaps performing academics should be dressed , like footballers , in the colours of their learned institutions , with their surnames in big capital letters on their backs .

leslie was in the first episode on the 19th february , 1985 . love him or loathe him ( and most women loved him ! ) , den and his screen wife angie were the heart of eastenders , pulling in an incredible amount of viewers on a christmas day episode , when den gave angie divorce papers rather than gift wrapped pressie . leslie was mobbed where - ever he went , and was a huge success . after eastenders he went into presenting ; he hosted fort boyard with melinda messenger and acted in the bill . leslie also has appeared as himself in many specials - he seems to always pop up on a top ten : tv baddies type list . he also is something of a wine connoisseur and has been asked to give his opinion on various tv shows . so 14 years went by , but we are all secretly waiting for ' den ' to come back ... leslie is married to actress jane laurie and they have three sons . they live in a � 650,000 house in wimbledon . mr. x 02 -

called � psychiatrist to concentration camps � . 4 . information received from professor dr. o.bumke , professor of neuropsychiatry at the university of munich medical school professor bumke stated on 7 june 1945 , that the practice of killing the mentally ill which had been instituted by the nazis , was supposed to be a deep secret , but the secret soon leaked out . " while nobody was supposed to talk about it , the sparrows were whistling it from the rooftops " . professor bumke stated that for more than one reason it was a tragic crime . the mistrust of the public against psychiatrists had been gradually stilled through faithful public service on the part of the psychiatrists extending over about 100 years , but this policy of killing the mentally ill had stirred up all that old mistrust again . " psychiatrists , as you know , were always suspected of � putting people away � , and now they were not only suspected of putting them away , but there was real evidence that they were actually killing them . that was the tragedy " . there was a wave of public mistrust , and finally public indignation forced the nazis to stop this policy " officially " in 1943 . " what has been done unofficially after that in eglfing and elsewhere is not known " . professor bumke received a letter in 1942 from the ministry of the interior asking him whether he had any difficulty with relatives if their kin was being transferred to state hospitals , and if so , for what reasons . he replied : " because they are afraid that this means their being transferred from life to death " . professor bumke stated that in his dealings with the nazis he had always adopted the policy of fairly open boldness , although it means " skirting the edge of the concentration camp " . in 1934 , he offered his resignation in a gesture of open disapproval of nazi policy . his resignation , however was not accepted . " since that time , they have left me alone , but " he stated , " if i had taken that step later rather than as early as 1934 , i would have probably been sent to dachau ; but as it was , they more or less kept me around as a famous figure for advertising to the outside world , but had written me off as an active participant in nazi policies . " dr. bumke stated that he had never treated hitler . hitler was treated by a doctor who was something of a quack and faker , by name of morel . morel treated hitler mainly with hormones . dr. bumke classified hitler diagnostically as " a hysteric psychopath , with excessive need for recognition and with traits of genius " ( " hysterischer geltungsbed � rftiger psychopath mit genialem einschlag " . " ) . 5 . information received at the badische heil- und pflegeanstalt ( state hospital for mental and nervous diseases of the province of baden ) in wiesloch , near heidelberg , germany a. information received from dr. wilhelm m � ckel , director dr. m � ckel was visited on 9 june 1945 . i was accompanied on this visit by major baruch . dr. m � ckel entered the conference room adjacent to his office , where we were waiting to see him , presenting the obvious appearance of a frightened man . he was pale , there was perspiration on his forehead , and he showed generalized tremor . when i reassured him that we were merely coming to obtain information and that we had no executive function , he calmed down , appeared greatly relieved , and his tremors ceased . after a few moments , he asked to be excused for a minute , went to his adjacent office , telephoned his daughter , telling her in german that it was not what he had feared and that there was no need for her any longer to stand by . he then returned to the conference room and put all his information at out disposal . the systematic execution of the mentally ill was prepared in 1939 by a questionnaire concerning all mentally ill patients , which had to be filled out by the physicians . this questionnaire included diagnosis , present mental state , whether mentally deteriorated or not , whether the patient had living relatives or not , whether he had served in the world war or not . this questionnaire had to be sent to the ministry of the interior in berlin . it was marked " strictly confidential " . it became known that the purpose of the questionnaire concerned transfers in order to make room in the state institutions . between march and may 1940 , mr. sprauer , the minister of the interior of the province of baden , sent orders that a certain number of patients ( usually 120 ) cases had to be ready for transport . excluding preceding collective transports of jewish patients , the transport administrator of gemeinn � tzige krankentransport g.m.b . h. took 800 patients out of the wiesloch . the last of the transports was sent out in the middle of 1941 . gradually the nature of the transports became talked about in the communities , because of the stereotyped nature of the letters received by relatives . these letters usually read " your mother " , " brother " , " sister " , " son " , respectively , " has died " . unfortunately all medical skill has failed to keep him alive . his / her ashes can be obtained by you by writing to ..... " the policy of exterminating the mentally ill by killing them had been initiated by the " reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft der direktoren der heil- und pflegeanstalten . " dr. m � ckel stated that he himself never went to their meetings . he avoided going to them by excusing himself on account of illness , but the truth was that he did not want to go . dr. m � ckel then added sheepishly : " we also had a children � s station of which dr. schreck was the head . he is pensioned now . the purpose of this children � s station was � intensive treatment � of mentally defective children , which was to culminate in their eventually being � put to sleep � " . " this children � s section was established in 1940 . it was organized and staffed from berlin . i have not admitted any of the children myself . i went through that section only twice when there were some complaints about the food . dr. scheck now lives in pfullendorf am bodensee . the children � s section ran only for a short time , approximately � to � year . " dr. m � ckel knew of only 23 children who were in that special children � s section , and he knew only of 11 children who were killed there . dr. m � ckel then turned over a list of 23 children , 12 of whom are marked as having died . he stated that one of them died from natural causes . he then turned over another file concerning children . of interest in that file was a letter which dr. von heener of the " reichsausschuss zur wissenschaftlichen erfassung von erb- und anlagebedingten schweren leiden " wrote to dr. m � ckel on 14 march 1941 . in this letter he asked him to come to a meeting in berlin w.8 . , vosssatrasse 4 , on 20 march 1941 . the letter ends with a request : " if you can not come personally please do not send a representative " . dr. m � ckel obviously did not want to go to that meeting because he stamped the letter as having been received on 29 march 1941 . after the children � s station was removed in 1940 , a delegation came from berlin which was headed by professor carl schneider of heidelberg . this delegation arranged for the killings in the future to be carried out elsewhere , after the patients were removed from the institution by the gemeinn � tzige krankentransport g.m.b . h. these patients were taken to killing centers which had been instituted in former state hospitals in grafeneck , near t � bingen in w � rttemberg , and in hadamar , near limburg an der lahn in hessen - nassau , germany . the transport chiefs of the gemeinn � tzige krankentransport g.m.b . h. which had to arrange the transports from wiesloch , were schweninger and seibel . dr. m � ckel turned over all documents concerning the killed adults to an officer of the u.s. army , by name of william f. nilan . he also stated that he had given all the secret papers to this officer ( it was over to the 7th army document center from where they were sent to j.a.g. etousa , attention : war crimes section , on 8 may 1945 , and received at 1100 hours on 11 may 1945 by pfc e.a.hose ) . the number of the documents at the 7th army document centre was 2090 . their registration number with etousa is a 340 . dr. m � ckel was quite proud of the fact that the mortality figures at his own institution had risen only slightly since 1935 ( table 3 ) . table 3 mortality figures among patients at the state hospital in wiesloch 1935 5 % 1936 4 % 1937 4.4 % 1938 5.2 % 1939 5.2 % 1940 5.7 % 1941 8.1 % ( dysentry ) 1942 7.6 % 1943 7.8 % 1944 6.8 % this table indicates a certain deterioration of care for those patients who remained at the institution without being officially marked for killing . the killing at the children � s station was carried out by berlin nurses . they used mostly luminal . at the killing centers in grafeneck and hadamar in 1940 and 1941 , gas and electricity were used for the killings . there were other killing centers in brandenburg and in vienna , and some patients who were sent from wiesloch to one of the nearly ( sic ) killing centers were sometimes later sent to brandenburg or vienna . dr . m � ckel added : " i never wanted to hear about what they did at grafeneck . it always nauseated me " . " later i could not stand it any longer . whenever a transport was to leave at night , i usually left the institution at noon and did not come back until the next day . " at first the patients did not know where they were being taken , but later it became known among the patients , and there were frightful scenes when patients did not want to be taken away . finally a storm of protest arose among the population because of the stereotyped death notices which they received from grafeneck , hadamar , brandenburg and vienna . at some time during that period sprauer held a meeting and said that patients who had been transferred would no longer be " put away " , but 8 or 14 days later another flock of death notices went out . because of the wave of public protest , the mass killing of patients in special killing centers was discontinued in the middle of 1941 , and a policy of extermination by starvation in the state institutions themselves , without transfer to a special killing center , was substituted . the policy of starvation had the advantage that the deaths were more spread out and masses of patients did not die on the same day . however , the former killing centers were partly maintained in that a relatively large number of starvation wards were instituted there , and transfers were still made to those starvation wards . thus 600 cases from wiesloch were transferred to hadamar for starvation up to june 1944 , when the last of these transports was carried out . these are not included in the previously given figure of 800 who were transferred to grafeneck and hadamar for mass killing between january 1940 and june 1941 . dr. m � ckel transferred patients for starvation also to other institutions , namely to eichberg and to various bavarian institutions , especially kaufbeuren . 150 cases , 60 men and 90 women , constituted the last transport to kaufbeuren on 4 june 1944 . a starvation center fancifully named " research house " was also taken over and staffed by professor carl schneider on dr. m � ckel � s own hospital grounds , where it was operated through 1942 and 1943 . dr. m � ckel claimed that he did not know how many patients were were killed there , and he stated tht he did not know until recently that any patients were killed there at all . dr. schneider had his own personnel there which was separate from the personnel of the state hospital at wiesloch . " our personnel was indignant over the way these people lived . they received wine and beer by the car - load directly from berlin . " the killing by gas and electricity had been objected to by legal experts of the government . they held that unless a " law for annihilation of valueless lives " ( " gesetz zur vernichtung lebensunw � rdigen lebens " ) was promulgated , these killings were illegal because a law against killing was still on the statute books of germany , which provided that whoever killed somebody else with premeditation should be punished by death . also the theologians objected to the killings . the bishop of m � nster , count galen , declared publicly from his pulpit : " who has knowledge of a murder and does not announce it becomes punishable himself . i have personal knowledge of 300 murders which have been committed , and i herewith proclaim and denounce them publicly " . all these objections which were whispered about in public forced those who had administered the extermination policies to " lay low " , and to confine their activities since 1942 to carrying out their killings by the slower and less conspicuous method of systematic starvation in special starvation wards , while the mass executions were discontinued since late 1941 . killings by slow starvation , however , continued until the nazi administration became defunct in 1945 . the patients transported to killing centers as well as the patients killed at wiesloch itself from 1940 to 1945 did not include any jewish victims since the jewish patients of wiesloch had been disposed of together with the normal jews living in wiesloch and surroundings as early as 1935 . they had all been taken away to an unknown destination which was supposed to be " somewhere in the pyrenees " . jewish patients were written off the books as " transferred to an institution outside of the province of baden " . dr. m � ckel stated that one of his nurses once set out to have a look at the killing center in grafeneck . dr. m � ckel felt that this nurse apparently had developed a certain amount of depression from seeing a lot of her patients transported off to be killed , and she developed a sort of obsession that she had to see the place . she was arrested after she go to grafeneck . dr. m � ckel suddenly got a telephone call from grafeneck informing him that one of his nurses miss amalie widmann , had been arrested because she had been spying about the place . she was arrested there by the s.s. on dr. m � ckel � s request they finally let her go after they threatened her with a concentration camp if she tried a thing like that again " and that means death " . i then expressed a desire to talk to miss widmann and she was called to dr. m � ckel � s office and interviewed in his presence . b. information received from miss amalie widmann , nurse at the state hospital in wiesloch , near heidelberg miss widmann stated that the first transport of patients to a killing center left wiesloch on 29 february 1940 . among the patients were a good many who had become endeared and attached to miss widmann . after they had been taken to the killing center , miss widmann became unable to take her mind off the sad fate of these patients , and she became unable to rest day or night . she had to think about them all the time . she finally felt that it might give her ease of mind if she could actually see what happened , and she decided to visit the killing center in grafeneck herself . so she asked for a furlough , not telling anybody what she planned to do , and she went to grafeneck on 22 july 1940 . when she got off the train at marbach a.d . lauter bei m � nzingen , which is the railhead for grafeneck , the people whom she asked for directions to grafeneck looked at her in a peculiar way as if there was something strange or funny about her . when she finally arrived in front of the institution in grafeneck , she found a sign reading : " entry strictly prohibited because of danger of infection " ( " zutritt wegen seuchengefahr strengstens verboten " ) . there were heavily armed men in green uniform , obviously police about the area . suddenly miss widmann felt gripped by an overwhelming feeling of anxiety and she ran away over an open field crying bitterly . she sat down and cried for a while . she then saw that she was on the premises of a stud farm . the farmer came and asked her whether he could do anything for her , and she told him that she wanted to go and see the institution in grafeneck . the farmer then told her : " do not go there . one must not say anything " . shortly afterwards , an ss man appeared , accompanied by other ss men , with hounds . they took her into the building , where she was brought before an official who asked her what she wanted . she said that she wanted to see some of her old patients and find out how they were . the official then stated that the patients liked it so much there that they would never want to leave again . he then interrogated her sharply abut her antecedents and her connections with any group , if any . he then called up dr. m � ckel . miss widmann added that she felt she owed her life to dr. m � ckel because if he had not talked for her they would have killed her . the reason why she went there was because of her deep feeling of close relationship with her patients ._. _ _ areapitl full area menu ( feature level ) pitlochry area connections ( feature level ) facts and figures : ben vrackie is 841 m or 2759 ft in height . the route described here is about 9 km or just over 5 miles in length . it involves some 700 m of ascent . the route can be seen superimposed in red on the photos below . left index ( feature level ) the smallest legal stills in scotland lying in the hills overlooking pitlochry from the east , is edradour distillery , the smallest distillery in scotland . edradour is the last survivor of the long tradition of farmhouse distilleries , and its annual output of 240,000 bottles per year would emerge from the stills of a large speyside distillery in less than a week . edradour entrance the still house the old maltings distilling in the highlands was for many centuries carried out by a large number of very small - scale , usually illegal , stills in farms , caves or wherever else they could find that was hidden from the vigilant excisemen and the troops that supported them . everything changed with the excise act of 1823 , which allowed small highland distilleries to compete on equal terms with the increasingly industrial lowland distillers . the 1823 act also introduced a minimum legal size for a still , just large enough to be difficult to transport and hide . the stills at edradour are the smallest in any distillery in scotland , and just above the minimum size allowed in the act . edradour distillery came into being , as a legal operation at least , in 1825 . it is one of the most beautifully arranged distilleries in scotland , comprising a neat whitewashed collection of buildings located in a small rising valley , either side of the burn that provides its water . in mid 2002 the burn provided rather too much water , washing away most of the garden and car park after very heavy rain . both have since been made good . view from the road distillery buildings it 's not uncommon to find distilleries that employ more people in the visitor centre than in production : this is certainly the case here , where the production side is run by just three men . the rest of the staff are engaged in the shop or conducting the popular free tours . the " standard " single malt now produced by edradour is a ten - year - old , a highly rated highland malt that for us carries a distinct and attractive overtone of the salt and seaweed much more characteristic of an island whisky . you can find out more about making malt whisky from our series of feature pages showing the stages in the process . edradour has changed hands a number of times during its history . after 20 years under the ownership of pernod ricard it was brought in 2002 for � 5.4 m by the signatory vintage scotch whisky company , the well established edinburgh based whisky bottling company . in its earlier life edradour had a fairly colourful history , and much of its production was alleged to have ended up in the usa by various means during the prohibition era of the 1920s . it has also been alleged that during this period the distillery was briefly and indirectly owned by the mafia . whatever the truth of this , the us market remained an important one for edradour . one result of this was that when the cargo ship the ss politician struck rocks just off the north shore of eriskay in the western isles on 5 february 1941 , en route to new york , a significant proportion of the content of the 264,000 bottles of scotch whisky in its hold was produced at edradour . as soon as the crew were safe , the islanders set to work saving the cargo . it is thought that over 2,000 cases or 24,000 bottles were liberated before the authorities arrived on the scene . in the aftermath , police and customs officers searched the entire island and several islanders were actually jailed for theft , not something advertised in compton mackenzie 's bestselling 1946 novel whisky galore based on the story of the ss politician , or the film it spawned . buy these books direct from amazon ; or visit our bookshop to browse through a large range of

a potential rival to the university of birmingham , a leading member of the elite russell group of universities . michael sterling , vice - chancellor of birmingham , welcomed the initiative and said it was time for some creative thinking about higher education in the city . " clearly , with three very distinct universities in one city , it 's sensible to take a hard look at the big picture and how we can best work together , whether separately , in combination , or even as one institution , " he said . his intervention provoked a furious reaction from peter knight , vice - chancellor of uce , who made it clear his approach was only to aston and that he did not believe a merger with birmingham was possible or desirable . aston - which recently turned down merger proposals with birmingham university - is saying nothing until its council meets next wednesday . there would be no talks with birmingham at the moment , said dr knight . " my board met yesterday and has a very clear policy to approach aston with this proposal . we have no policy to approach birmingham and no authority or intention of engaging in such discussions . in my opinion it is not possible , even if it was desirable , " he said . dr knight has the backing of the uce governors to ask the government to dissolve the former polytechnic ( established as a university in 1992 ) and allow it to merge with aston . he said : " aston and uce have very little overlap in their academic curriculum so it is much more manageable . it [ the merged university ] would be a big hitter and a major economic force in the north and east of the city , which needs regeneration . together we could really make that part of the city hum . " the two neighbouring institutions were operating on what was effectively one campus , explained dr knight . uce heated the aston student union because the boiler was in one of its buildings , and as the university expanded it would be daft to put in separate facilities , he added . in a paper to the uce board he stated : " there is no doubt that the most stable relationship , which would yield long - term benefits , is likely to be a full merger . as the two universities have different constitutional structures this could be achieved by the transfer of uce to the chartered university of aston . such a development would establish aston university as a major university , mainly in the north and east side of the city with a turnover approaching � 200 m . it would ensure that integrated and coherent provision was available to all students studying at the enlarged aston campus , and that the commitment of both institutions to the economic development of the learning and leisure quarter in eastside was reinforced . " aston university issued a brief statement that it had been informed of the approach and would make no further comment until next week 's meeting of its council . related articles 22.03.2001 : aston pulls out of merger talks with birmingham tvu and reading 27.10.2003 : tvu merges with reading college 12.08.2002 : tvu in merger talks with reading college manchester 07.03.2003 : super university for manchester 01.08.2002 : merger creates ' forward looking ' university who else is merging ? 25.07.2003 : bradford merger fails 01.11.2002 : bradford institutes announce merger plans 18.03.2003 : cardiff university to merge with medical college 11.03.2003 : welsh universities in merger talks the ucl / imperial merger 18.11.2002 : opposition ends imperial and ucl merger dream 18.11.2002 : ucl merger halted to stop ' damaging ' rows 19.11.2002 : merger on the rocks ? the market for mergers 03.12.2002 : risky business 03.12.2002 : together we stand_vbp _ _ bskyb poised for bold entry to broadband market with aggressive ' triple - play ' deals energywatch casts doubt over new ombudsman return to glory for an italian icon arcelor investors vent anger on directors costain shuts international unit as new ceo makes his mark feelgood factor liable to be offside for the economy , says halifax drax to pay special dividend as prices soar apple admits it may have mishandled stock options richard wray : market forces mastercard faces � 230 m fine as eu flexes muscles as sir alan tells his new apprentice she 's hired , the real winner is the bbc quiet achiever michelle dewberry , 26 , triumphs in all - female final owen gibson , media correspondent thursday may 11 , 2006 the guardian alan sugar with michelle dewberry , the winner of bbc 2 's the apprentice . photograph : ian west / pa for 12 weeks she and her rivals on the hit bbc2 show the apprentice endured the worst that sir alan sugar could throw at them . but for michelle dewberry , a former supermarket checkout girl from hull , the brickbats and bitching were last night forgotten when the irascible entrepreneur told her : " you 're hired . " she described her victory over the no - nonsense sales dynamo ruth badger as " unbelievable " . the showdown between the two finalists , who have become friends in the six months since filming finished , had been dubbed " the icewoman v the badger " by the tabloids . article continues " it was n't until right at the very end when he said i 'd won that i believed it , " she said . " it shows you do n't need to be loud and cocky and bolshie , just work as hard as you can and hopefully you will get on in life . " victory is liable to prove lucrative for the softly spoken ms dewberry . on top of her six - figure salary , rival tabloids were yesterday engaged in bidding for the exclusive stories of both finalists . last year 's bafta - winning series , in which the former london underground marketing man tim campbell triumphed , was a word - of - mouth hit . but the second has performed even better , attracting audiences of more than 5 million . ms dewberry 's victory marked the latest chapter in a tale of triumph against adversity that appeared to soften even the hard - as - granite image cultivated by sir alan . she left school with two gcses and a year later her elder sister fiona died at 19 after falling from an eighth - floor window . " i 've lost people close to me , but i did not let it destroy me . instead , i used it to propel me and give me strength and determination , " the 26-year - old said on last week 's episode . by the age of 24 she was running her own telecoms business and gave up an income of � 100,000 a year to compete against 13 other contestants . living together in hampstead , they were split into two teams and set new tasks each week , from flogging fruit at a street market to letting property and organising events on a cruise ship . at the conclusion of each episode , sir alan called the losing team into his boardroom to tell one of them : " you 're fired . " ms dewberry was fairly anonymous early on , when flamboyant characters such as the wideboy salesman syed ahmed dominated . but despite being described as " cold as a fish " by one of sir alan 's aides , she came into her own as the series progressed . both finalists have spent the six months since filming finished working for him and two endings were filmed to keep them guessing ahead of the denouement . ms badger , who endeared herself to viewers despite a domineering manner , is unlikely to let the result affect her confidence . the 28-year - old sales manager from wolverhampton said she was " absolutely gutted " not to win . her mother , edna hall , added : " ruth had a sales glint in her eye the day she was born . if she could have flogged her bottle she would have done . " she has already launched her own promotional website , offering viewers the chance to win a dinner " with me , ruth badger " . sir alan said it had been a " very , very tough " decision . " i think it 's down to the job that i have in mind that pipped it for michelle , " he said . " i found her very focused , very determined , very organised , and this particular job i have in mind requires all of those skills . " ms dewberry 's new role is far from glamorous . she is to set up a division called xenon green , disposing of companies ' unwanted computer equipment . contestants who appeared in the first series have used it as a launchpad for a media career . saira khan , the motormouth bundle of energy who finished as runner - up , is making a bbc daytime self - help show called temper your temper and writes a column for the daily mail , while paul torrisi sold his property company for � 4 m and has landed his own show on sky . mr ahmed was yesterday tipped by agents and broadcasters to be the contestant most likely to remain in the public eye . mr campbell , who developed an anti - wrinkle skincare gadget called integra for sir alan , is still with the company . a succession of pundits have opined that the apprentice is as far removed from the world of business as its glamorous shots of the square mile are from sir alan 's amstrad headquarters in essex . the self - made millionaire now makes most of his money from property and contestants appeared baffled when asked what the company actually did in the penultimate episode . yet critics have been almost unanimous in their praise . the bbc has ordered a third series and is developing a celebrity version to air during comic relief . roly keating , controller of bbc2 , said yesterday that the show had " exceeded all our expectations " , adding : " it is a phenomenon and a real talking point . audiences have responded to its blend of documentary skills and a truly great format . " view from the boardroom " it is brilliant tv and anything that gets young people interested in business is good , even if it is crass and over - simplified . it brings to life dull and theoretical concepts . we have been known to stand around the water cooler and say there are things we could learn from the previous night 's show . but the bullying behaviour is completely unacceptable . i would have a problem if anyone in this organisation behaved like that . " alan giles , chief executive , hmv group " it is not a business programme . it is entertainment , although i do n't think it is very entertaining either . businessmen do not turn up in a bentley and scream you 're fired at people . i think it puts business in a very bad light . alan sugar does everyone a great disservice by doing it . young people will be turned off because they think they will be shouted at by a horrible fat old rich bloke . " sir digby jones , director general , cbi " it is pretty riveting stuff . intelligent entertainment . it is really just a very extended interview and it set quite intelligent tests to suss out the candidates . but i would n't want to take 15 weeks to choose one person . it is not the best use of my time . and it is much harsher than real life - most people are pretty civilised these days . " sir gerry robinson , former chairman , granada , and the boss in the tv show i 'll show them who 's boss " the general principle of a businessman taking counsel from a limited number of people and then making swift decisions is fairly typical . it is how many people work . i do n't think alan sugar is too rude and i do n't think he humiliates people that much . but i think that some of the candidates deserved it - and i think i would have been fairly rude to them too . would i have wanted ruth badger sitting in the office next door to me ? absolutely not , everyone else in the company might leave . " moray maclennan , chairman , m&c saatchi uk_nnp _ _ entering an avalon ui context - 4/9/2004 12:06:54 pm jason olson has just posted an article showing how avalon 's multithreading handling improves on the way windows forms works . it 's a good summary of the issues , but he misses out my favourite feature . as you may already be aware , i 'm a fan of code that generates try ... finally blocks automatically for locking constructs . however , jason shows an example which uses an explicit try ... finally block to ensure that the ui context he acquires gets released . his code is more or less of this form : private void updateuifromworkerthread ( ) { try { this .context . enter ( ) ; // do stuff to ui now that we 've got the context ... } finally { this .context . exit ( ) ; } } this is all very well , but i 'd prefer to use less code - i want things to look as elegant as they do when using the lock keyword in c#. fortunately , avalon supports exactly the same trick i used in my blog showing what to do if you like the lock style of syntax , but need to use timeouts when acquiring locks . avalon 's uicontext provides a function called access ( ) , which enters the uicontext and returns a temporary object that implements idisposable . this temporary object calls exit ( ) for you when you dispose ( ) it . this means that you can take advantage of the c # using construct to generate the relevant try and finally blocks , with a generated call to dispose ( ) ( and therefore , indirectly , exit ( ) ) inside the implicit finally block . this means your code can be much simpler : private void updateuifromworkerthread ( ) { using ( this .context . access ( ) ) { // do stuff to ui now that we 've got the context ... } } this code will exit ( ) the context when the flow leaves the using block . no need to clutter your code with explicit finally blocks . interestingly , the current build ( 4051 - the pdc version ) gives access ( ) a return type of idisposable , so they 're not using the optimization that eric gunnerson pointed out for my solution : if you return a struct as the helper object that calls dispose ( ) , you can avoid a heap allocation . but making the return type returning idisposable effectively prevents this optimization - if you do return a struct , the clr has to box it onto the heap , negating the purpose of the optimization . maybe they 'll change this in a future release of longhorn . ( although maybe not - using a specific struct as a return type means there 's another type to document , making the api appear to be more complex to the user . so perhaps the user education issues mean the optimization is n't worth it here . ) the only fly in the ointment is that , as the documentation says , this uses an infinite timeout when entering the context . as i said in my previous blog , i think that 's a risky thing to do . so what i would really like to see is some kind of way of specifying a timeout so that a deadlock will cause an error to be thrown ( eventually ) rather than locking up my application for ever . copyright � 2002 - 2005 , interact software ltd. content by ian griffiths . please direct all web site inquiries to_in _ _ jacques tati : serious playtime french filmmaker jacques tati quietly booked his place amongst the pantheon of film comedy 's legendary figures with a small but exquisitely conceived body of work . in astutely re - interpreting some of comedy 's oldest and purest techniques , filtering them through a distinctly modernist framework , tati became an influential guiding light for the generations of comedians and filmmakers that followed . tati developed his comic intentions in the early part of his career as a performer in the french music - hall . supplying the customary apprenticeship in the essentials of comedy , it would also prove to be the point of departure for an ambitious tati to spread his wings , eventually transferring his stage qualities to film , in 1948 he directed and starred in jour de fete , his first feature film . as fran � ois , the over - worked and irritated postman of a peaceful rural village , tati began his cinematic formulation of physical comedy with an extended finale sequence reminiscent of a charlie chaplin or buster keaton set - piece , featuring francois tearing around on an antiquated bicycle in a torturous effort to complete his rounds , and avoid the myriad perils of the countryside . humour derived from the awkwardness of tati 's own physique ( he was very tall and lanky ) quickly established itself as a major pre - occupation in his work , receiving further attention , on a more universal level , in his later films . tati introduced his most enduring character , the near - silent and bumbling monsieur hulot in 1953 with monsieur hulot 's holiday , perhaps the best loved and most accessible of all his films . donning his comical hat and arching his pipe inquisitively , hulot leaves the city for a spell in the sun , ruffling the feathers of the parisian holidaymakers and causing untold devastation along the way . tati 's unfussy plot decisions simply constructed the necessary unfamiliar environment within which hulot could be best placed to act as the comedy stooge in relation to the strangeness that surrounded him . tati understood that great comedy , and great comedy moments , are created out of difference and alienation . the � fish out of water � formula employed in monsieur hulot 's holiday ensured the necessary sparks of conflict and tension that could then be released in a number of hilarious pay - off scenes . with each film that followed the ambition and complexity of tati 's comedic style grew . he committed himself fully to a rigid filmmaking approach that became increasingly apparent onscreen . tati pioneered a comedic process that relied almost exclusively on visual elements infused with ambient sound ; dialogue was almost entirely abandoned as a means to convey humour . presented in an often uniform and unobtrusive fashion with the camera doing very little work at all , tati 's subsequent feature films appear as little more than a collection of frieze - like sketches strung together for cheap laughs . however , this surface simplicity belies a complex , multi - layered process of preparation and choreography that tati stuck to meticulously . an encroaching satirical edge , until now largely dormant , soon manifested itself much more clearly in tati 's work . themes of alienation and disenfranchisement soon found specific targets as tati launched his attack on the complications of contemporary french society , publicly citing particular grievances with the self - automated blandness of modern homes and workplaces . mon oncle ( 1958 ) features hulot in his own , disappearing natural habitat : suburban paris . hulot makes his rickety home above the local shop in a sleepy enclave of traditional � frenchness � , complete with rustic market stalls and cobbled , hand - swept streets . tentative trips to the other side of town leave hulot baffled by his relatives ' modernist shrine , where every gadget and convenience simply compounds his confusion . hulot is presented as an anachronism , ill at ease in a changing environment ; puzzled by modern devices and customs and unable to function or interact successfully with individuals ( such as his sister and her husband ) eager to embrace the new technology . tati managed to wrap a charming story concerning the relationship between hulot and his cheeky nephew around his more serious social pre - occupations . emerging nine years later in 1967 , tati 's masterpiece of cerebral comedy : playtime drew together all of his ideological concerns in one tightly packed visual canvas . shot on 70 mm film stock and featuring bold set and sound design , every scene in playtime is a cascade of visual comedy effects , going off like fireworks one after the other , producing an overwhelming sensory assault that is , at times , physically hard to take in . tati maintains his customary distance , never resorting to the tight close - up but preferring to expose hulot 's everyman figure as isolated and insignificant amidst the imposing uniformity of his surroundings . hulot is a passenger ambling through a fully modernised paris of sleek glass and steel office towers , now transformed to resemble every other major city in the world , as depicted in numerous tourism posters . the city 's treasured monuments are but a fading memory , seemingly incongruous with the new ethos of cold conformity . the eiffel tower , the arc de triomphe and numerous other icons of antiquated french culture are spotted in reflections as people pass through the clear glass doors , as constant reminder of what has passed . in order to facilitate his vision for playtime , tati had an entire scale - city built on the outskirts of paris . dubbed � tativille � it featured moveable , cut - down models of skyscrapers that could be positioned accordingly and large ground - level street sets custom - made to suit the directors ' pre - planned intentions . tati built sets to represent a notion of modern day paris , it seems ironic that jean - luc godard 's sci - fi noir thriller alphaville , filmed two years before , was shot on location in the french capital , despite the events of the film taking place some time in the future . grandly designed and curiously executed , playtime is a uniquely conceived piece of cinema . jacques tati once said famously that he endeavoured to produce films that would make people smile . on reflection , his body of work proves that he went much further ; subtly encouraging people to observe more intently and to think more astutely about social concerns through a gentle form of humour . those concerns may seem a little less relevant today , but the films lose none of their potency or charm as a consequence . filmography parade ( 1974/i ) ( tv ) trafic ( 1971 ) playtime ( 1967 ) mon oncle ( 1958 ) les vacances de m. hulot ( 1953 ) jour de f � te ( 1948 ) gai dimanche ( 1935 ) oscar , champion de tennis ( 1932 ) vive la france people not familiar with their french cinema can often be quite derogatory about it , snootily suggesting that the sum of the gallic movie business over the past decades amounts to brigitte bardot lying on a bed asking a brooding , cigarette smoking ..._: _ _ lack of objectivity in home office country reports source national coalition of anti - deportation campaigns home office minister , des browne said today that " accurate , objective and up to date information is vital to ensure a robust but fair asylum system " it 's true . the government 's country information policy unit ( cipu ) country reports reports are used for assessing asylum decisions , used extensively by home office presenting officers at appeal level , and are taken by most members of the judiciary to be objective and impartial . des browne says cipu report information is " of a high standard " and that he is " confident of the impartial way in which it is produced " ias has now published a comprehensive analysis of 2004 cipu reports ( see below ) , and says that although there have been improvements since * 2003 , there are still many issues . below are describing words used by ias ... " lack of objectivity " " unbalanced representation " " serious breach of objectivity " " inclusion of such blatant political opinion " " all reports contain unattributed statements " sourcing issues are " so endemic as to give the reader serious doubts about the validity of the report " ias concludes that cipu reports still can not be considered ' credible or free from political or policy bias ' . shockingly , amnesty international found that ' caseworkers were discouraged from searching on the internet ... furthermore some caseworkers do n't even feel the need to use the cipu information or any other sources of information as they felt their knowledge of the countries was sufficient merely based on casework alone " the ias say that problems with the below cipu reports are " so serious that they make the report an inaccurate representation of the conditions in the country to the extent that , in our opinion , it should not be used in determining asylum claims . - afghanistan , albania , angola , china , colombia , drc , eritrea , iran , northern iraq , nigeria , sri lanka and zimbabwe . ncadc 's suggestion is that so - called " failed " asylum seekers from these countries convey ias 's comments to their legal advisors and ask if the comments could contribute to further challenges of refusals of their claims . asylum seekers of the above countries whose claims have not yet been determined should ensure their legal advisor has a copy of the ias report and uses it . ias also comments on cipu reports of the following countries - somalia , sudan , egypt , uzbekistan , sierra leone , serbia & montegnegro ( incl . kosovo ) , romania , algeria and burundi . one improvement announced today by the home office is that " the production of country information material used by the home office will now be undertaken by a country information unit dedicated solely to that function and the country policy function will be performed separately within the home office 's immigration and nationality directorate " . whilst ncadc welcome this improvement , we think that production of country reports should be undertaken by an independent non - governmental organisation . the home office also said that " country reports will be published on the top twenty asylum producing countries ( and other countries identified by operational need ) instead of the current thirty five countries . this will enable resources to be focused to assure the standard of the material produced while ensuring that country reports are produced on the main asylum generating countries " ... this may possibly mean that cipu reports of the " top 20 " countries get better , but reports on the other 15 countries fall further and further out of date , and thus , possibly unhelpful . the full ias report can be found below . * the immigration advisory service ( ias ) did an analysis of cipu 2003 reports and said that there was a " surprising degree of plagiarism , misquotation and inaccurate citation of source material " . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + " lack of objectivity in home office country reports " immigration advisory service ( ias ) has published a comprehensive and damning analysis of the home office country information reports used for assessing asylum decisions . http://ias.live.poptech.coop/c2b/document summary of findings ias found that the majority of the april 2004 cipu reports constituted a significant improvement on their april 2003 counterparts . however , a number of major problems remain . the most significant of these is a lack of objectivity . at times this involves the direct insertion by the cipu author of opinion into the text , at other times it is by way of an unbalanced representation of material from selected sources . other notable concerns include the poor presentation of the reports which allows contradictory material to stand without comment , over - reliance on one source of material , serious omissions and poor sourcing . in some cases ( see below for a list ) , these problems are so serious that they make the report an inaccurate representation of the conditions in the country to the extent that , in our opinion , it should not be used in determining asylum claims . in the ias ' home office country assessments : an analysis ' ( september 2003 ) one of the major criticisms was the surprising degree of plagiarism , misquotation and inaccurate citation of source material . this rendered the cipu assessments an unreliable source of information . in many of the country reports , these concerns have been substantially addressed . some country reports , however , remain as poorly annotated as in april 2003 . in several of the reports there is a noticeable lack of editing . we are aware that cipu noted the criticisms raised by ias and other organisations in response to the consultation last year and we have been impressed by cipu 's openness and willingness to implement change and improvement . ias understands that cipu hope to implement the full set of changes by the october 2004 reports , and so these comments below are given as an assessment of how the changes have affected cipu so far . home office opinion each country report opens with a section on the scope of the document . in the ' instructions on producing country reports ' it is stated that ' all country reports must contain the standard wording as in annex 1 ' . the first sentence of paragraph 1.2 states unequivocally that the report ' does not contain any home office opinion or policy . ' ias researchers found that the opinion of the writer ( and therefore of the home office ) had crept into the reports on many occasions . in rare , but highly significant instances , this had occurred directly . more common was a lack of balance found in the reports , where positive information was , without any stated reason , given precedence over negative information . the negative information was often not included at all or only in brief form . the issue of opinion was of key concern to the advisory panel on country information and was discussed at length at the meeting in march 2004 . this is given further elucidation under the conclusion and recommendations section of this overview . direct insertion of opinion in the nigeria country report , on five separate occasions , cipu have added sentences that give a significantly better impression of internal security than that contained in the source material . three of these statements give evidence to the effect that the nigerian police reacted in a timely and fair manner , one that the police were justified in their use of force , and the other that the government relies less than previously on the armed forces . on all of these occasions , it is claimed that this is the opinion of a particular source . however , not only was this opinion not offered by these sources , the opposite was true : the sources all testified to the inefficiency of the police , their unjustified use of force and the increase of reliance on the armed forces . this is such a serious breach of objectivity that it means the nigeria country report is not a reliable document on which to assess asylum claims if those claims involve the question of availability of state protection , or police or state abuse . another example is found in the first three paragraphs of the general introduction to human rights in the eritrea country report , which include two comments to the effect that the standard of human rights is better than under other military dictatorships found in neighbouring countries . in the first instance , this is not relevant information for a decision - maker trying to assess the protection needs of an eritrean claimant . information on the appalling detention conditions and torture and abuse by government forces would be better placed here . in the second place , this reflects a significant lack of editorial scrutiny . the inclusion of such blatant political opinion from an unnamed embassy source which infers that it is acceptable to return someone to these atrocious conditions because they are not as bad as they could be , makes cipu complicit in that view . this is not a question of offering a balance of information to that given by the us department of state and amnesty international ( both of which find significant evidence of torture , and appalling detention conditions ) because the source is not offering any verifiable alternative view . indirect insertion of opinion of particular note with regard to the above are the country reports on somalia and iran . somalia was one of the countries assessed independently by the advisory panel on country information and it is surprising , for this reason , that more care has not been taken with regard to this report . information that is outdated or only indirectly relevant to the subject matter is retained in place of more recent and relevant information that gives a more negative assessment of the situation . the most surprising example of this practice is the exclusion of material from a home office source ( the report of a joint fact - finding mission to somalia ) . with respect to refugee returns , for example , the cipu report devotes two paragraphs to listing the specific numbers of somali returns from neighbouring countries , whilst vital information from the fact - finding mission on at - risk categories of returnees from western countries is omitted . in relation to iran , the cipu writer appears to be unable to accept that human rights conditions have deteriorated in this country . whilst ample information is given regarding the election victory of president khatami and the reformists in 1997 , 2000 and 2001 , the report gives barely any information with regard to the majles elections of february 2004 in which the conservatives won a landslide victory ( following the disqualification of many reformist candidates ) . the report repeatedly chooses to cite un sources from 1998 which talk hopefully about an improvement in the human rights situation rather than using more up to date sources . this blatantly violates paragraph 1.5 of the country reports ' scope of document ' , which claims that the sources ' remained relevant and up to date at the time the document was issued ' ( see below for more on this ) . there are many other examples of imbalance leading to a positive gloss on the presentation in the country reports . we believe that in the cases listed below , this is severe enough to make these sections of the cipu report unreliable sources for use in asylum decisions . afghanistan o the effect of the constitution o internal security o us abuse of afghans o returns o role and ability of ngos albania o mental health o media restrictions o roma o trafficking angola o situation in cabinda , particularly government involvement china o the effect of the constitution o aids statistics colombia o justice and impunity o the political administration of president uribe o ties between the paramilitary and government forces o sufficiency of protection dr congo o political prisoners o hiv / aids o child care provision o impunity eritrea o human rights overview iran o the political situation , and political activists o human rights generally o stoning northern iraq o judiciary o effective protection of human rights o women 's rights o law and order o social services o political system nigeria o sufficiency of protection , particularly police o police abuse sri lanka o prosecution of security force personnel zimbabwe o persecution of perceived political opponents o persecution of family members of political opponents o medical facilities poor construction / lack of analysis cipu employs a standard format for the layout and presentation of information in the report . it has proven impossible to fit the correct information into the relevant section for some countries with this fixed format . it may be that the editorial board of cipu need to allow the writers greater flexibility within the standard format . in most , if not all cases it appears that the up to date information has been tacked on to the end or the beginning of the section . this means that no attempt is made to point out discrepancies between sources - on several occasions cipu give conflicting information from one paragraph to the next , without any indication that the conflict exists , let alone why preference should be given to one source over another . this can range from minor contradictions to more serious ones . in the iran country report , paragraph 6.198 begins with the assertion ' activities of opposition groups such as tudeh , iran paad , komala , and fedayeen have not been evident in iran in recent years ' . in the same paragraph cipu continues ' a number of kurds , including members of komala , have been executed in recent months ' . it is a basic editorial activity to recognise that the first quote comes from a 1998 source ( hence ' recent years ' is not all that recent ) and to cut this statement in preference for the second source which refer to executions in 2003 ( which not only proves komala active , but demonstrates the interest of the authorities in the group ) . in the afghanistan country report , paragraph 6.84 tells us that the situation for hindus and sikhs is good . 6.85 then says hindus and sikhs returning to afghanistan have found that their houses and temples have been total ruined or are occupied and they have no means of repossessing their property due to fear of reprisals and that most are homeless and without jobs . often these contradictions are not even placed in subsequent paragraphs , leaving it up to the perseverance of the reader to ascertain that there may indeed even be a contradiction . in the same report cipu state the number of pashtuns as being 38 % ( at 6.114 ) and then 44 % ( at 6.121 ) ; hazaras as 19 % ( 6.114 ) and 10 % ( 6.136 ) ; uzbecks as 6 % ( 6.114 ) and 8 % ( 6.152 ) . in the colombia country report there is only one general section on ' persons targeted by guerrilla and paramilitary forces ' , consisting of an unwieldy nineteen paragraphs , many of which give contradictory information . since the majority of colombian asylum - seekers to the uk fear persecution from guerrilla or paramilitary forces , this should surely be the crux of the report . it would be sensible to give detailed evidence on groups , political or otherwise , that are at risk . whilst the country reports do have information on the various arms of the internal security forces , none of them have dedicated sections to availability of state protection . internal security is covered in the standard ' section 5 - state structures ' which attempts to set out the technical legal or constitutional position in a country ( for example , stating that torture is unlawful ) rather than the actual position on the ground and any reported human rights abuses by these forces . in countries such as colombia where the vast majority of claims are related to non - state actors , it would be pertinent for cipu to create a section dedicated to this . information on protection in the colombian country report is dispersed throughout in four non - related paragraphs , the most relevant of which is hidden in a section entitled ' treatment of non - governmental organisations ' . over - reliance on a single source all of the cipu reports rely extensively and uncritically on the us department of state human rights reports . on average about 60 % of the material is direct quotation from the us department of state . this raises several different issues . the first relates to political opinion and the reliability of this as a source material , the second to the broader issue of the role of cipu . the ' country reports on human rights practices ' from the us department of state are unsourced documents which rely on primary and secondary sources of information . according to the ' preface ' these reports are compiled by the relevant embassies through their contacts with ' human rights organizations , public advocates for victims , and others fighting for human freedom in every country and every region of the world . ' whilst for many countries this can be a very good source of information , for others it leaves much to be desired . it has become quite evident over the last two years that us government awareness of the situation on the ground in countries where they have no embassy is questionable . for example , the us had no presence in iraq from 1991 - 2003 . their intelligence was based therefore not on embassy sources as cited above , but on satellite photos and the word of dissidents . the debate over the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq has made it amply clear that information from these latter sources is far from reliable . particular care should therefore be taken when using these reports to reflect the current situation in dr congo , iran , somalia and sudan which do not have a us embassy . furthermore , the us department of state is not itself free from political bias or opinion . it has been criticised by both the us - based organisation lawyers committee for human rights and human rights watch for the lack of objectivity in its reports concerning countries in which it has a politically sensitive stance . this would certainly apply to colombia , egypt , iraq , and uzbekistan . the colombia country report directly quotes from the us department of state in 110 out of the 215 paragraphs . the political opinion of the us department of state has been incorporated wholesale into the cipu country report and this has particularly affected the objectivity of the report with regard to justice and impunity , the political administration of president uribe , and the ties between the paramilitaries and the army . there is an abundance of evidence available to cipu from credible organisations such as the unhchr ( february 2004 report ) , human rights watch ( who , unlike the us department of state , give detailed footnotes for their primary sources including information regarding who they interviewed , when , what evidence they saw , etc . ) and international crisis group . the cipu country report for colombia has to be considered an unreliable document for determining asylum claims in light of this , as the wealth of evidence supplied by virtually all other sources either directly contradicts what is said by the us department of state , or gives details which expose its positive glossing of the situation . there are many other examples of over - reliance on the reports of the us department of state , such as in the sierra leone country report , where the outstanding and award - winning work of human rights watch only receives two references , one of which is erroneous . amnesty international , similarly , are only accredited with the fact that sierra leone retains the death penalty . the strong reliance on the us department of state reports also raises the question of time , money , and necessity . since 60 % of the country reports is directly copied from the us department of state , it would be simpler , quicker , and more accurate if home office caseworkers were advised to read the us department of state report in the first instance . whilst this is not written for the asylum process , the danger of segmenting it into various chapter headings is that , even when accurately quoted , information relating to the same point gets omitted or lost into another section . this is systematic throughout the cipu reports ( see above ' poor construction ' ) . sourcing paragraph 1.2 of the ' scope of the document ' states that : a ) ' all information in the report is attributed , throughout the text , to original source material . ' paragraph 1.4 of the ' scope of the document ' states that : b ) ' the great majority of the source material is readily available in the public domain ' and ' copies of other source documents , such as those provided by government offices , may be provided upon request . ' paragraph 1.5 of the ' scope of the document ' states that : c ) ' all sources have been checked for currency , and as far as can be ascertained , contain information , which remained relevant at the time this report was issued . some source documents have been included because they contain relevant information not available in more recent documents . ' paragraph 1.6 of the ' scope of the document ' states that : d ) ' where sources identified in this report are available in electronic form the relevant link has been included . ' none of the above statements is accurate for any of the 23 country reports checked by ias . in the ' report of advisory panel on country information consultation exercise on cipu country reports october 2003 ' cipu respond to this criticism by commenting ' although errors of this kind do not , in our view , compromise the fundamental integrity of the reports , they may undermine confidence in them and must be eradicated as far as possible ' . while ias is very happy to note cipu 's determination to rid the report of these sourcing errors , we still believe that when a considerable amount of the material in a given report is wrongly sourced , this completely undermines the integrity of that report . if an expert before the immigration appeal tribunal were to produce a report claiming that conditions in detention in france , for example , amounted to a breach of article 3 , and the iat found that over 50 % of the material did not come from the credible source that the expert had cited , the court would be unlikely to give much weight to the evidence of the expert , and the thesis that detention conditions in france were inhuman and degrading would remain unproven . when it is found that these credible sources actually state the opposite , as is often the case in cipu reports , the expert report would have to be considered as fundamentally flawed , lacking in integrity and would therefore be rejected in its entirety . the same would apply to a journalist writing an article , an academic writing a research paper or a student writing an essay . it is extremely difficult to understand why cipu maintains that such errors do not affect the overall reliability of the reports . in the ' home office country assessments : an analysis ' ( september 2003 ) , ias found the level of sourcing was so poor that many of the reports were chronically unreliable and little faith could be given to their thesis that these countries were largely free from risk for certain individuals . in this year 's analysis , ias is happy to report that there has been a significant improvement in most of the countries assessed , particularly with regard to plagiarism and basic inaccuracies . however , sourcing is still not up to a satisfactory level to give the reader confidence in the reports , and some country reports are as bad , or worse , than in april 2003 . a ) ' all information in the report is attributed , throughout the text , to original source material . ' all reports contain unattributed statements . some of these are literally left without a source , others have been credited to a source which does not give the relevant material as claimed . in some country reports this is so endemic as to give the reader serious doubts about the validity of the report . in the iran country report in sections five and six alone there are 35 mis - sourced statements and 12 unsourced statements . in the angola country report ( sections 5 , 6 and annexes ) there are 27 mis - sourced statements . in the somalia country report there are 15 mis - sourced statements . in the iraq country report , mis - sourcing or misunderstanding the source accounts for 30 % of the information checked . of particular concern is serbia and montenegro ( including kosovo ) which is so badly sourced and edited as to raise serious doubts about the validity of the whole report . indeed at one point the endnote to the paragraph even states ' no source found ' . are we then to believe that cipu are making this up ? why was this paragraph included in the document if it can not be sourced ? the editing notes have been left in throughout ( this also occurred with afghanistan , china , liberia , nigeria , sierra leone and turkey ) which displays poor editorial work if nothing else . almost without exception , virtually all of the page numbers given for the us department of state report did not relate to the online version or the printed - out version of this report . they were all inaccurate . in some cases the reports did not even run to the page number claimed . cipu should use the section references supplied by the us department of state rather than invented page numbers . b ' the great majority of the source material is readily available in the public domain ' and ' copies of other source documents , such as those provided by government offices , may be provided upon request . ' about 40 % of the material is not readily available in the public domain ( not a great majority ) . some is correspondence , a lot is by subscription service only . for the purposes of this analysis , ias requested these unavailable documents from cipu for certain countries . unfortunately this was not an efficient process . with regard to romania , half the sources did not arrive , those that did arrive contained only partial amounts of the document ( so it was not possible to check if the information was contained in them ) and they arrived a month after requesting . requests for documents on iran never arrived at all ( despite three requests being made ) . given that cipu 's reputation has been so severely tarnished with regard to misquoting from sources , this would have been a good opportunity for this fear to be set aside as regards documents not in the public domain . this did not happen , which leaves the possibility open that the documents do not contain what they are supposed to contain . documents for eritrea , drc , iraq , sierra leone , somalia and sudan arrived as requested , albeit some four to six weeks after the request was made . this would often be too late for use in an asylum appeal , and definitely too late for use in an initial decision . c ) all sources have been checked for currency , and as far as can be ascertained , contain information , which remained relevant at the time this report was issued . some source documents have been included because they contain relevant information not available in more recent documents . ' this is also not true . several reports contained examples of sources used which had not been sourced at all ( usually left in from previous years ) . in the nigeria country report , there were many times when the footnote had been amended to make the material from the us department of state report for 2003 , when in actual fact it was a direct quote from 2002 or 2001 . with regard to serbia and montenegro ( including kosovo ) there have been 21 documents released on the amnesty international website on these countries since last year and not one of them is used or referenced in cipu 's april 2004 report . use of out of date material is also particularly problematic in the algeria and iran country reports . d ) ' where sources identified in this report are available in electronic form the relevant link has been included . ' this is not the case . most of the sources are found electronically , and only the homepage has been given not the actual link . even then , some are cited so badly that it is not possible even to find the homepage . the ' instructions for producing country reports ' actually state ' [ t]he length of link should ideally be kept short and if necessary further navigation details given from that . ' we have seen no evidence at all of further navigation details being provided . the length of the link is so short as to preclude the finding of the document . for some the homepage or website given is no longer live and has clearly not been checked since the previous year . several of the sources in each report are listed so badly that it is impossible to know to what they are referring . for example no date is given or no name of the article . one such example is from the iran country report which states ' [ 16a ] various - punishments [ guardian , times , daily telegraph ] 17 february 1998 ' . ( the times published two articles on this date relating to iran , neither the guardian nor the daily telegraph published anything to do with iran on this date ) . in some instances the report simply refers to the website without specifying what on the website ( this is hugely problematic if this relates to an organisation with a large website with thousands if not millions of reports such as the united nations ) . this is against the instructions given by cipu on the production of country reports , and is a simply point that should easily have been spotted by an editor . basic inaccuracies this relates to mistakes in dates , names or basic information . this was a vast improvement from the april 2003 assessments . concerns still remain with regard to albania , burundi , china , eritrea and serbia and montenegro ( including kosovo ) . plagiarism the most noticeable improvement on the april 2003 assessments is the use of quotation marks to denote when material is being taken directly from a source . out of the 23 april 2004 country reports analysed by ias , concerns remain with regard to afghanistan , eritrea and serbia and montenegro ( including kosovo ) . conclusions and recommendations 1 . objectivity the purpose of cipu is to provide country information of relevance to decision - makers involved in determining asylum claims . this can be sub - divided into three strands of people : policy - makers , caseworkers , and judiciary . policy - makers it has been pointed out that the name itself ' country information and policy unit ' is problematic . cipu do not , despite their title , attempt to drive or make policy . however , they do produce information ( both the country reports and the operational guidance notes ) which feed into policy decisions . it remains highly problematic that cipu are part of the home office . the more detached and objective the country reports become , the more questions must be raised about home office policy . for example : 1 . how can the home office justify inclusion of sri lanka on the non - suspensive appeals ( nsa ) list when the cipu report makes it clear that the necessary criteria are not met ? 2.how can the stance on returns to iraq and somalia be justified , when the cipu reports indicate the general high - level risk to all returnees ? according to the nationality , immigration and asylum act 2002 , the secretary of state may add a state to the nsa list if there is ' no serious risk of persecution ' . the cipu report details the continuing regular use of torture by both the government and the ltte and the culture of impunity for human rights violations . it also reports that the legal mechanisms in place are not sufficient for tortured detainees to receive a fair trial . the regular use of torture in detention to extract confessions which are then admissible in court hearings , surely , constitutes ' a serious risk of persecution ' . cipu state that their reports are used in decisions on whether failed asylum seekers can be returned to a country , but given the above , it is clear that they are ignored . caseworkers cipu 's main users , the key target audience , are home office caseworkers making initial decisions on asylum claims . however , as noted above , it is clear that the reports do not meet the needs of the caseworkers as they make such a poor attempt ( and fail ) to ' signpost ' caseworkers in the direction of information . in addition to this , research by amnesty international found that ' caseworkers were discouraged from searching on the internet . they were instructed to contact cipu through a senior caseworker if further information was required about a claim . ' furthermore some caseworkers do n't even feel the need to use the cipu information or any other sources of information as they felt their knowledge of the countries was sufficient merely based on casework alone . judiciary in the minutes of the 2 march 2004 meeting , andy saunders , assistant director of cipu , commented that ' none of the points accepted [ i.e. the individual criticisms received by cipu from ias and others ] would have affected any decision on an asylum claim ' . whilst it is possible that no single individual point may be responsible for a wrong decision , ias is of the opinion that certain country reports as a whole have been the leading factor in making many wrong decisions . the cipu country reports are used extensively by home office presenting officers at appeal level and are taken by most members of the judiciary to be objective and impartial . the iat representative to the apci , andrew jordan , commented ' he could not emphasise strongly enough how much the iat relied upon cipu 's reports and how important it was that they were impartial . ' similarly in saber v sshd ( ct of sessions ) , [ 2004 ] inlr 222 - 231 it is said , ' if , for example , an adjudicator were to accept evidence from an appellant that was expressly contradicted by all sources of independent information , such as cipu assessments , the tribunal might well disturb the adjudicator 's finding . ' cipu argue that any political bias on behalf of the writers of the reports is not a deliberate attempt to skew information in any one direction . however , the chair of the apci , steven castles , commented that : [ e]rrors of the types listed might be expected to be random , and therefore to more or less cancel each other out . yet in this report the overwhelming majority of errors seemed to lead to an overly optimistic picture about sri lanka . this suggested that the errors may not be completely random , and that some other factors may be at work . cipu must accept that a degree of political opinion is bound to be present . according to cipu ' although country experts may have a better contextualised understanding of the country situation , they are also more likely to have subjective opinions on the matter . ' ias considers this statement unsubstantiated and naove . one of the fundamental criteria for any expert is objectivity as far as such a thing is possible . experts , by their very nature have received training and have years of experience in producing academic objective opinion that is thoroughly scrutinised and supported by evidence . in addition , when experts give evidence in appeals , they routinely sign documents stating their awareness of their duty to provide impartial information to the court or tribunal . cipu country officers lack both this training and experience , and , as has been shown above , their work is barely scrutinised at all and very often is unsupported . 2 . structure the structural failings already identified and the standard template lead cipu to disperse relevant information throughout different sections and make the documents extremely difficult to use . we recommend that cipu structures each country report to be of relevance to that particular country . for example , if the majority of claims relate to persecution by non - state actors , then cipu should provide a section on the availability of state protection . at the very least the standard template should be re - examined . cipu reports should include analysis and comment only to the extent that discrepancies between sources are pointed out to the reader . where sources conflict and it is possible to give precedence to one report over the other , cipu should state this and give its reasons . for example , ' different figures are given for the number of aids sufferers in ruritania , but cipu concur with those of the world health organisation as these are based on a 2003 two - month in - country assessment by a team of experts , rather than the figure reported by aids sufferers unite as this report is reliant on 2001 estimates . ' rather than being a string of quotes starting with the positive and leading to the negative , often emphasising the former disproportionately , cipu should begin each section with a brief introduction along the lines of ' while the us department of state reports that human rights were adhered to in general in ruritania , amnesty international and human rights watch both give specific examples of torture in detention ' . 3 . editing cipu note that they have included an additional week into the schedule ' for the specific purpose of thoroughly checking each report ' , and that they have implemented a ' revised management structure which provides for closer control ' . the ' instructions on producing country reports ' states that ' country reports must be rigorously checked internally prior to publication . country reports must never be published without having first been quality assured ' . this policy is either not followed , or the editors are extremely deficient in editing skills . the editing of the reports remains atrocious . the publishing of seven country reports with the editing notes still in place in the document is extremely surprising and provides a clear indication that the reports were not given any final check . basic issues such as obvious spelling errors throughout , poor sourcing ( see below ) , and unintelligible sentences also remain prevalent . the early editing of the reports is also weak . the ' instructions on producing country reports ' commands the editor to check a ' minimum of 20 sources ' . yet ias found a large number of statements were mis - sourced . if this editing facility was done at random as suggested by the instructions , then such a large number of mis - sourced statements should not remain . the alternative explanation is that the majority were mis - sourced to begin with , but we would hope that an editor who found more than half of the random sample to be mis - sourced would have the initiative to go on to check a further 20 . those chosen to edit reports should be trained in editing and basic research skills , and need to be absolutely rigorous in the application of these skills to the reports . if reports do not reach a minimum standard by publication date they should not be released until that standard has been met . 4 . sourcing cipu should use footnotes . every statement should be properly annotated as is done in this report with the title of the document , the name of the body producing the document , the date and the weblink ( where applicable ) included . if there is no weblink , cipu should write ' available in hard copy only from * * * * ' and give a precise telephone number or email address . these sources must then be provided expeditiously and in full on request . to work to less thorough standards of sourcing in this context is not good enough . if cipu is to provide objective evidence for matters pertaining to life and death , it absolutely must be able to support every single statement it makes to a clearly signposted location . 5 . past and present tense ias welcomes cipu 's assertion that all reports will be written in the past tense . this was not done for all of the april 2004 reports and it is hoped that this will be the case for october 2004 . 6 . dating of material ias welcomes cipu 's initiative to use the most up to date information on all occasions unless material from older sources is still relevant . when using older sources , cipu should state that more recent information was not available from the sources consulted . cipu should state a cut - off date for when the writers have stopped incorporating new material . this is extremely important in the context of asylum claims and appeals , where the decision - maker is making a judgment about risk on return as if it were to take place tomorrow . at present , cipu reports mislead decision - makers into believing that the information is current when in fact it is not . it is important that this perception is corrected by the stating of a cut - off date . the problem is complicated by the sporadic nature of cipu updating . some reports include one or two articles from february or march 2004 . however , as this is only one or two , it is often a valid criticism that cipu have not engaged in the events of these months with proper rigour . amnesty international ( published may of the year after ) , human rights watch ( published january of the year after ) and the us department of state ( published february / march of the year after ) note that their information is solely regarding the previous year and ends on 31st december . whilst it is highly relevant for asylum decisions that the most up to date information be available , this should be by way of supplement rather than hurried inclusion into the country reports . ias hopes that this analysis will be helpful to cipu and the apci in improving the standard of the country reports to a level where they can be considered reliable and useful documents . however , ias still believes that information on countries for use in making decisions in matters of life and death should be given to an independent body that is respected and admired by all sides in the process : an independent documentation centre . the content of the reports produced should also feed into and dictate the subsequent formation of home office policy as it relates to returns of failed asylum seekers . in the house of lords report on ' handling eu asylum claims : new approaches examined ' , the lords stipulated that ensuring the availability of ' authoritative and credible country of origin information ' to those making the decisions was essential to improving the current asylum process . the lords noted that the cipu country assessments were not accepted as ' authoritative , credible or free from political or policy bias ' . ias research proves that despite the measures put in place by cipu following recommendations from the apci , the cipu reports still can not be considered ' credible or free from political or policy bias ' .

" which would be fine if they actually did make money . but , as we noted on the front page of this site , the videogames business is actually a financial disaster area . roughly 95 % of all games released actually lose money , and publishers only survive by raking in massive sums on the few successful games they manage to produce . taken as a whole , the industry loses hundreds of millions of pounds every single year , which is why its trade body elspa is continually going cap - in - hand to the government asking for huge subsidies of taxpayers ' money like those granted to the movie industry . yes , not only is the videogames industry happy to rip you off by charging far more than videogames ought to cost - and far more than they cost anywhere else in the world - they actually want you to hand over your tax money so that they can keep doing it . so if games lose money , why do we think they should be cheaper ? the truth is , were the price of games to be reduced , a wider spectrum of software would be successful , people who currently quite rightly feel ripped off would buy more games instead of resorting to illegal pirate copies - which the industry insists help to fund terrorism , drug - dealing and pornography , by the way - and people who currently do n't play games at all because of the prohibitive cost would be brought into the market . sales would soar by more than enough to make up for the price reduction . every time the industry has seen significant price reductions - such as in 1997 when a price war reduced the nationwide price of playstation games from � 40 to � 30 - sales have rocketed by far more than the relative size of the price cut . unfortunately , the fat cats can never resist the temptation to force the price back up as soon as possible , because they do n't want people to get used to cheap games . ( if they did , the next big blockbuster might make less money , you see . they simply fail to grasp that with lower prices , the 95 % of unsuccessful games they also publish might not be unsuccessful , so they 'd actually make more money overall , and by not putting all their eggs in one basket they 'd be running a much less risky business . ) fair play does n't want to destroy the videogames companies . it 's the belief of almost everyone in the industry , from consumers to journalists to game developers , that significantly lower prices would ultimately bring more money and profit into the industry . the only people who do n't believe that , the only people who insist on the high prices , are the people whose incompetent management of the industry have caused it to lose billions of pounds and tens of thousands of jobs in the last few years . so you 'll forgive us if we do n't have too much respect for their professional skills . but these people are n't , sadly , smart enough to listen to simple arguments .. so we want to persuade them using the only language they ( even vaguely ) understand - money . if we hit them in the pocket , they 'll listen ._. _ _ mandatory electronic payment - surcharge default notices if you are a large employer you may face a surcharge at the end of each tax deduction year if hmrc does not receive cleared funds in respect of the full monthly payment by the new payment date ( 22nd of each month ) . hmrc will send large employers a default notice every time a cleared monthly payment ( or any part of it ) is received after the new payment date . amount of surcharge the amount of surcharge depends on how many times you pay late and are sent a default notice and is a percentage of the amounts payable for the year as shown on the end of year return , form p35 . each default attracts a percentage rate of surcharge which increases as the number of defaults continue within a surcharge period . the actual percentage used for the annual surcharge calculation is the total of the percentages that apply to each of the defaults within the year . the surcharge period starts at the point in the deduction year in which the default first occurs and does not end until there has been a complete tax year with no defaults . once default has occurred it could take an employer as long as 23 months to be completely clear of a surcharge . for example , if the employer defaults in may 2004 ( deduction year 2004 - 05 ) they will need to ensure they do not default again in the remainder of deduction year 2004 - 05 and ensure they do not default at all in deduction year 2005 - 06 . each default is counted within each surcharge period . the first two defaults in a surcharge period are charged at zero per cent . further defaults are counted and are charged at increasing percentage rates as shown in the following table . default number ( within the surcharge period ) specified percentage % 1 0 2 0 3 0.17 4 0.17 5 0.17 6 0.33 7 0.33 8 0.33 9 0.58 10 0.58 11 0.58 12 and more defaults 0.83 example 1 an employer defaults four times in 2004/2005 , five times in 2005/2006 , once in year 2006/2007 four times in year 2007/2008 , no defaults in 2008/2009 and three defaults in 2009/2010 . surcharge would be calculated as follows : tax year default count ( at tax year end ) surcharge percentage ( at tax year end ) % surcharge on a net charge of � 600 k pa surcharge on a net charge of � 12 m pa 2004/05 4 0.34 ( 0 + 0 + 0.17 + 0.17 ) � 2,040 � 40,800 2005/06 9 1.74 ( 0.17 + 0.33 + 0.33 + 0.33 + 0.58 ) � 10,440 � 208,800 2006/07 10 0.58 � 3,480 � 69,600 2007/08 14 3.07 ( 0.58 + 0.83 + 0.83 + 0.83 ) � 18,420 � 368,400 2008/09 0 no surcharge and surcharge period ends as no defaults in the tax year 0 0 2009/10 3 0.17 ( 0 + 0 + 0.17 ) � 1,020 � 20,400 the example illustrates that the surcharge calculation only starts again from zero per cent after a full tax year has passed without any default . in this example , that is not until tax year 2009/10 . any large employer who defaults and is liable for surcharge will be sent a surcharge notice with a calculation detailing the amount of surcharge due for the tax year . example 2 an employer incurs no defaults at all in 2004/2005 . in 2005/2006 the employer fails to make a payment by the due date on three occasions and receives three defaults . in addition the employer pays its cis deductions late twice that year and receives a further two defaults . in 2006/2007 the employer again pays its cis deductions late twice and receives a further two defaults . surcharge would be calculated as follows : tax year default count ( at tax year end ) surcharge percentage ( at tax year end ) % surcharge 2004/05 0 0 � 0 2005/06 5 cis defaults and 3 defaults each on paye , nic and student loan ( sl ) duties cis % used = 0.51 ( 0 + 0 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17 ) paye / nic / student loan % used = 0.17 ( 0 + 0 + 0.17 ) cis surcharge is � 255 this is based on 0.51 % of the 2005/2006 cis annual charge of � 50,000 the paye / nic / sl surcharge is � 935 this is based on 0.17 % of the combined 2005/2006 annual charge of � 550,000 so total 2005/2006 surcharge is � 1,190 ( 255 + 935 ) 2006/07 7 cis defaults and no defaults for paye , nic and sl duties . cis % used = 0.66 ( 0.33 + 0.33 ) no surcharge charged on paye , nic and sl duties . the surcharge period ends in respect of these duties as no default of these duties occurred in the tax year cis only surcharge , which is � 330 this is based on 0.66 % of the 2006/2007 cis annual charge of � 50,000 appeals a large employer has the right of appeal against a default notice on the grounds that either : they are not in default ( they may have a reasonable excuse for paying late , as a result of circumstances beyond their control ) . they are not a large employer ( however the employer can not appeal on the grounds they are not a large employer , if they have already appealed unsuccessfully against the statutory notice telling them they are a large employer ) . inability to pay is not a reasonable excuse . a large employer may appeal against a surcharge notice on the grounds that the number of defaults stated in the notice is incorrect or the amount of surcharge is incorrect . in both cases the appeal has to be made within 30 days of the notice . the appeal must include : the paye reference . the paye scheme name . the reason for the appeal . the appellant 's position in the business . the appellant 's signature ( followed by being printed in capitals ) ._. _ _ give us the perfect excuse to treat yourself to mackie 's ice cream everyday and you could win free mackie 's for a year . we are collating our favourite excuses to enjoy mackie 's -

why transplant a whole pancreas and not just the islet insulin producing cells ? is a pancreas transplant suitable for all diabetics ? is it a simple procedure ? do i need to take any other medicines afterwards ? are there any risks ? what are the benefits of a pancreas transplant ? how successful is it ? how long will i be in hospital ? is it dangerous ? what happens to my old pancreas ? do i need to continue on a diet ? what next ? what is the pancreas and why is it transplanted ? the pancreas is an organ situated inside the abdomen , close to the stomach . it secretes pancreatic juice that helps the body to digest the food we eat . it also secretes hormones into the blood . one of these hormones is insulin . small clusters of cells within the pancreas called islets produce the insulin . when these cells are damaged , they do n't make insulin and a lack of insulin causes diabetes . by transplanting a new pancreas into a diabetic patient we also transplant the islets . this provides a new source of insulin , which means patients no longer need to inject insulin . why transplant a whole pancreas and not just the islet insulin producing cells ? although research has been conducted for many years into islet transplantation , it is not yet that successful . only about 2 % of the pancreas is made up of islet cells and it is a difficult procedure to extract the cells to transplant them on their own . a few patients have received islet transplants , but the islets work better and for longer when a whole pancreas is transplanted . is a pancreas transplant suitable for all diabetics ? no . only type i diabetic patients , those who become diabetic when they are young and do n't make any insulin . type 2 diabetics do still make insulin , but develop a resistance to it so that a pancreas transplant would not help . in addition it is normally restricted to patients who also need a kidney transplant . is it a simple procedure ? a pancreas is usually transplanted at the same time as a kidney . it is a more complicated procedure than a kidney transplant and takes much longer to perform . the operation itself involves connecting the blood supply of the pancreas to the vessels that take blood to and from the leg , usually the right leg . the leg normally gets much more blood than it needs and does not suffer from the operation . in addition to connecting up the blood vessels another join has to be made into a piece of bowel to drain away the digestive juices that the new pancreas produces . all this is done through an incision in the abdomen . do i need to take any other medicines afterwards ? yes . like all transplants you need to take drugs called immunosuppressants . however since you will be having a kidney transplant at the same time you will be having these drugs anyway . what you wo n't need again is insulin . are there any risks ? like all transplant operations there is the potential for problems . in the case of pancreas transplants these problems include rejection of the pancreas , clotting of the blood supply , and inflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis ) . rejection will happen in about a third of pancreas transplants , and clotting of the blood supply in about 5 in 100 . we are always monitoring you for these problems and you will be given treatment to avoid them or treat them . in addition some patients , ( about 4 in 10 ) will need a second operation to fix a problem that occurs early after the transplant . it is true to say that problems in the early days are more common if you have both a kidney and pancreas than if you just have a kidney . however you will be carefully assessed to make sure you are fit enough to withstand the procedures before your name is placed on the waiting list . what are the benefits of a pancreas transplant ? as well as not needing to give yourself insulin injections anymore you wo n't need to worry about frequent blood sugar tests or diabetic diets . the biggest benefit is that once you have a pancreas transplant , and your insulin is controlled automatically , most of the other damage that diabetes does to you is stopped . in some cases some of the problems may improve , although it usually takes several years to see any improvement . this includes problems with nerve damage and heart disease . the pancreas will also stop you damaging your new kidney in the same way your diabetes damaged your own kidneys . how successful is it ? a kidney transplant in a diabetic patient is very successful , with over 85 % working one year after , and with an average life of 8 to 10 years . results of a pancreas transplant are also good , with over 75 % working at a year and lasting an average of 8 years . because of its improved success it is now the recommended treatment for patients with diabetes and kidney failure in america . nevertheless occasionally it is n't successful and the pancreas may need to be removed ( 10 % of patients in the first year ) . how long will i be in hospital ? for a kidney transplant alone patients normally stay for 7 to 10 days . following a kidney and pancreas transplant the stay is longer , normally 3 to 4 weeks . is it dangerous ? diabetes is dangerous � it damages your kidneys , your eyes , your arteries and your nerves . pancreas transplantation is potentially dangerous , and therefore you will be carefully looked after . occasionally patients may die from combined pancreas and kidney transplantation , just as they may die after kidney transplant alone � but it is uncommon ( less than 5 in 100 ) . what a successful pancreas transplant would do is allow you to reduce the damage which diabetes causes so that your chances of being alive in the long term ( 10 years from now ) are better if you have a pancreas and kidney than just a kidney alone . what happens to my old pancreas ? we do not touch your own kidneys or pancreas � they are left alone . your own pancreas continues to work producing digestive juices . do i need to continue on a diet ? you will not need to follow a diabetic diet , or a renal diet . we would ask that you avoid putting on a lot of weight . what next ? the transplant doctors will see you and they will assess your suitability for a transplant , if you would like to be considered for one . if you want to ask any further questions please feel free to do so . you may contact the pancreas transplant coordinator julia baylis on 01223 216536 . authors : mr chris watson , consultant transplant surgeon & julia baylis , pancreas transplant coordinator at addenbrooke 's hospital july 2005_cd _ _ at suzarn , we believe jewellery should not only be beautiful , but should also be made of quality materials . great jewellery is a combination of the talents of the designer and artisan and the treasures supplied by nature . it should lift your spirits and your outfit every time you wear it . our pearl and gem jewellery is hand crafted to give you the pleasure of owning something very special with its own individual charm . our silver jewellery is hand finished in contemporary designs to give a stylish and versatile accent to your look . at suzarn , we have over thirty years ' experience of crafting and seeking out beautiful jewellery to help you feel special , attractive and confident . jewellery is an important part of what you wear and we believe our customers deserve quality and stunning design . treat yourself , you deserve it . about the stones amethyst : the birth stone for february , amethyst is a translucent stone varying from pale lavender to purple in colour . aquamarine : aquamarine is a pale greenish blue stone which goes especially well with spring and summer outfits . it is the birth stone for march . citrine : citrine is a crystal varying from almost clear to yellow , often containing both in the same stone and appearing to glow from within . it is one of the birth stones for november . pearls : the birth stone for june , pearls are an organic gem produced by oysters and require gentle handling , but follow a few easy guidelines and they should keep their beauty for years to come . pearls should be cleaned by wiping them gently with a damp cloth without any detergent or other chemicals . ideally , pearls should be put on after other jewellery , clothing , perfume or hair spray and the first item taken off when undressing . they are best stored away from other pieces of jewellery or any other hard items . rock crystal : one of the birth stones for april , rock crystal is a clear stone which looks great either faceted or polished in chip shapes . it goes especially well with white pearls . rose quartz : a lovely stone , pale pink in colour , which combines beautifully with the lustre of pearls and with silver . peridot : a stunning green stone , peridot is the birth stone for august ._. _ _ you are here : home � council services � licensing � prohibited streets for street trading � street trading seaton seaton beer road , - extending from queen street to westcliff terrace . castle hill colyford road , - as far as the cemetery and harepath road as far as harepath hill . court lane cross street eyrecourt road fore street , � - extending from marine place to its junction with court lane harbour road car park harepath road , � - extending from queen street to its junction with homer lane and including the triangle of grass contained within harepath road , homer lane and barnards hill lane . highwell road manor road marine crescent marine place meadow road orchard car park queen street seafield road seahill seaton town hall - marsh road car park seaton town hall reserved car park seaton down road - � extending from harepath road to cherry drive . stock lane the burrow the esplanade the square the underfleet , - � together with the roundabout which forms the junction with underfleet way and all its surrounding highway ( up to and including its junction with harbour road car park ) . trevelyan road underfleet way unnamed road - � extending from crs ( pioneer ) supermarket to seaton town hall reserved car park_nnp _ _ 22 march 2006 give us justice widows battle back over lost pensions by isabelle kassam and clinton manning six brave widows robbed of their husband 's pensions have vowed to keep fighting for justice . their courage symbolises the struggle of 85,000 families who have been refused compensation for pensions lost when the firms they worked for went bust . last week , the government rejected the parliamentary ombudsman 's demands that the victims be compensated . ann abraham 's savage report said the government should shoulder responsibility , as it convinced workers that their company pension schemes were safe and guaranteed . advertisement pensions secretary john hutton refused to accept the findings of the report . but this has not dented the widows ' belief that they will eventually win what they are entitled to . " we 're not asking for handouts , " insisted jean wade , the first widow among the pension theft victims . " our husbands worked all their lives and contributed to these pensions every week . as far as we are concerned , they are deferred wages . all we are asking for is our own money back . " jean,58 , wrote to mr hutton on behalf of six widows - the first six wives among the pension theft families to lose their husbands - asking him to meet with them and discuss their plight . mr hutton , who will get a � 90,000 a year pension when he retires , ruled it out , claiming he was too busy . barbara powell brave barbara , 55 , laid flowers on the grave of her husband paul on monday - the first anniversary of his death . " paul had heart disease and had a triple bypass operation , " she said , fighting back tears . " but the worry over the pension pushed him into declining ill health . " i watched him grow weaker each day and i 'm convinced that the anxiety he felt about our future resulted in his early death . " barbara has taken a job as a receptionist to boost her � 7-a - week pension . paul was entitled to a � 10,000 a year pension but lost it when crown wallpapers - the firm where he worked for 34 years - went under . despite his illness , paul found a new job in an attempt to rebuild the retirement fund . but travelling from his home in rossendale to manchester in the rush hour each day caused his health to deteriorate . he was only 56 when he died . barbara said : " i may have to sell it to finance my own retirement if the government does n't finally face up to its responsibilities . " its rejection of the ombudsman 's directive is enough to make you give up hope . but i 'll carry on fighting for all the widows and pension members who have been robbed . " sue day sue , 59 , lost her husband ernie in 2004 , after a year - long fight against bowel cancer . he had worked for label maker samuel jones for more than 30 years and paid into the pension scheme for 25 of them . sue also worked there and paid into the scheme for 18 years . when the couple 's eldest son matthew died in 2000 , they were devastated and ernie asked for early retirement to come to terms with the loss of his boy . " his requests for early retirement were repeatedly turned down until april 2002 , when he was told he could retire in december , " explained sue . however , the company went into administration in july 2002 , taking ernie and sue 's pensions with it . " ernie died desperately worried that after 38 years together he had not been able to provide properly for me . " i can never replace what has been taken from me . our plans for retirement were to travel and enjoy together . now i wo n't be able to either of those things . " but determined sue insisted : " i 'll never give up this fight . " jean wade jean , 58 , is also determined to fight on in the hope of retrieving her late husband 's pension payments . " the government has betrayed us . pensions secretary john hutton has refused to meet us but i will not give up , " she insisted . jean , of gosport , hants , was forced to sell her family home after being robbed of the pension her husband bernie had paid into for 28 years at steel - maker asw sheerness . " the parliamentary ombudsman ruled in our favour . " she said that we should be compensated by the government because it has lied to us . " so i am sickened that it has rejected that finding out of hand . " jean should have had a widow 's pension of � 188 a week but is now forced to survive on � 64 a week . she has also taken on a parttime job in a shop to help make ends meet . jean wrote to john hutton asking him to meet the widows . " he wrote back saying he was too busy - he should be ashamed of himself . " " what can be more important than helping widows who have not only lost their husbands but , thanks to the government , their financial security as well ? " marlene cheshire marlene , 61 , felt compelled to lie to her husband dave on his deathbed so he could die in peace . " he was broken - hearted about leaving me financially insecure , so i told him the government had agreed to restore our pensions . " dave from hemel hempstead , herts , died of prostate cancer in july , aged 62 . he had been fighting for his � 10,000 a year pension since 2003 , when shelving firm dexion - where he worked for 32 years - went bust . marlene gets � 78 a month from the financial assistance scheme but is determined to fight on for her full pension rights . carol bowden carol , 59 , barely gets by on a � 25 a week pension . that 's all she is left with , despite husband roy paying into his company scheme for 36 years . roy , a steel worker at asw cardiff , died 13 months ago aged 59 . his pension had been due to pay out a lump sum of � 85,480 on retirement . " i am not going to give up fighting for my husband 's pension because it was deferred wages . " i 'm also bitterly disappointed that the government has chosen not to act on the parliamentary ombudsman 's report . it just is n't right . " sylvia teagle sylvia , 55 , is convinced the stress of losing his pension sent her late husband alun to an early grave . the steel worker , who also worked for asw cardiff , died of a heart attack in june , aged 54 . " i 'm sure that the stress caused by the loss of his job and pension contributed to his death , " insisted sylvia . alun worked for asw for 33 years and was in its scheme for 31 years before the company folded . the couple had been expecting a lump sum of � 84,217 when alun retired but now sylvia only gets � 1,024 a year or � 19.69 a week . " i get by on my savings but have to watch every penny . the government has let us down badly . "_'' _ _ ' gaze ' theory for radio ? ' radio drama 's significant other - film ' - paper by alan beck gaze 1 a main problem is that so much film theory is linked to the visual . an example is the male ' gaze ' and associated psychoanalytic theory . the ' gaze ' was polemically outlined by laura mulvey in ' visual pleasure and narrative cinema ' ( mulvey 1975 ) and subsequently augmented by teresa de lauretis ( de lauretis 1984 ) . here is a quick definition . formal elements of film are linked to unconscious psychic processes , particularly the point - of - view shot . the male look at women is privileged , either fetishising the continuously - threatening image of women - threatening , that is , to the male psyche - and/or sadistically punishing the fetishised object . the ' gaze ' is an entr � e into psychoanalytic ' master narrative ' theory and it is about deconstructing male power . ( see daniel chandler 's media and communication studies site , ' notes on the gaze ' . ) the greatest contribution of ' gaze ' theory to film studies is that it has enabled discussion of the gendered construction of narrative and gendered positioning . so , if the ' gaze ' is about oppressive ways of seeing , are there oppressive and analogous ways of radio listening ? these would be of use to radio theory . my answer is probably not , from this theoretical angle anyway , and mainly because the ' gaze ' is an unacceptable first principle , or point of deduction , for radio . it is visualist and there is no getting around that . gaze 2 let me chase radio ' gaze ' theory through to its unacceptable conclusion . i recognise two things . firstly , michael bull , in his valuable study , sounding out the city . personal stereos and the management of everyday life , has written on the urban gaze in the lifeworld , and the ' fragile strategies whereby subjects attempt to maintain those bourgeois rituals of civility and etiquette ' ( bull , 2000 , chapter 6 ) . he studies , through interviews , the use of a personal stereo which ' permits the user to control the ' gaze ' through a variety of interpersonal strategies ' . bull does most valuable work to extend apparatus theory , and here linking listening apparatus to what i have termed the ' listening zone ' in the lifeworld ( beck 1997 ) . gaze 3 secondly , i also recognise that for some film theorists , the ' gaze ' master - theory has been discredited anyway and for a decade . david rodowick argued that mulvey 's approach was too reductive and that her analysis of the female character on the screen and female spectator in the auditorium did not allow for the possibility of female desire outside a phallocentric context . ( see rodowick 1991 , and especially chapter 1 , on how mulvey has been ' canonized by professional film theory ' ; currie , 1995 , xv ; prince in bordwell et al , 1996 , 77 ; carroll in allen and smith , 1997 , 45 . ) note . most recently , gill branston wonders why so much time has been spent in some film classes on the classic mulvey ' male gaze ' position . she describes it as a ' sacred relic ' ( branston , 2000 , 27 ) . she notes that mulvey herself refined and critiqued it only a few years later ( mulvey , 1989 ) and others have taken the critique even further . ( see gamman and marshment 1988 ; gledhill , 1995 ; cowie 1997 . ) gill branston calls for a move to aesthetics and to analysing other ways of looking in cinema ( women - looking - at - men , as well as men - looking - at - women , men - at - men , women - at - women ) . she also calls for further work on ' the powerfully inherited modes of melodrama which continue to shape contemporary cinema ' ( with reference to the striking work of gledhill , e.g. gledhill 1995 ) . there is also much valuable work to be done on modes of melodrama in radio drama . gaze 4 and so to radio . i have to follow a rather dense argument here . if an attempt were made to transpose a laura mulvey- teresa de lauretis - peggy phelan type of ' gaze theory ' to radio 's language , for example - and that has not been ventured - then ' radio gaze theory ' would impose itself even more severely on radio theory and radio text analysis . i mean even more severely than in film . suppose radio is to follow film along the same lacanian path . then language itself , being phallocentric , could be argued to coerce a radio listener identification , with a position of male antagonism towards women . mulvey 's male looking and female ' to - be - looked - at - ness ' of film would become radio 's male hearing ( the constructed and coerced radio listener - male or female ) and female ' to - be - heard - of - ness ' on radio . that is , either female speaking in phallocentric language or female silence . gaze 5 this will not do . it is unconstrained master - theory association , in linking ' gaze ' with radio . frankly , if one starts from a proposition which is a contradiction in itself ( visualist master theory for radio ) , anything can be deduced and there is no chance for coherence in argument . ' gaze ' theory just will not do for radio . the foundations for the gendered constructions of radio must be sought elsewhere . it is , of course , an urgent and continuous task . in a forthcoming book chapter on ' gay radio ' , i attempt to hitch radio theory to queer studies , though in a limited way . for radio reception theory and radio aesthetics , the search may well be in the direction of pleasure and desire - of ear - to - brain contact , the erotically ambivalent and in what suggests sexual deviance , for example . gesture , eye contact and dress are ' absent ' in radio drama , and the radio display is one of voice , but only primarily . there is a contradiction here . voice , without the benefits of paralanguage , reveals a male / female binary and is this irreducible ? does the radio voice contradict the possible deceptions of drag and masquerade ? this is a puzzlement . what about sex - reassignment surgery and its after care in radio drama characters - male - to - female transsexuals characters , female - to - male transsexuals ? are we left with a casting negation , like male - to - female transsexual hayley cropper in ' coronation street ' ( played by julie hesmondhaigh ) ? gaze 6 to sum up . my argument is that ' gaze theory ' just will not do for radio . it links radio theory to a discredited psychoanalytic master - theory , and as jean - francois lyotard suggests , the age of ' grand narratives ' is over . but there are alternatives here . radio higher - order theory might need a theory synthesis that is integrated across all the formats ( genres ) of radio ( music , commercials , sport , drama etc . ) . it might need a theory synthesis that is linked to successful work in other areas , such as psychology ( forrester 2000 ) , film ( allen and smith 1997 ) and anthropology . this would be radio core theory . a possible starting point is with listening , with the listener and the broadcasting apparatus , and the ear - to - brain . this is a whole collection of research on an area i term aurality - the listening - in - itself , and extended radio apparatus theory . this core theory synthesis would have to be coherent and credible . the alternative is a radio higher - order theory area that is a bunch of disparate theories , partially realised , and some of them small theories . and that is what we have to live with for the while . the search for radio higher - order theory is long and will not be arrived at all at once . and maybe not at all . right now , radio is plunged into the digital age and the possibility of the very ' death of radio ' ( beck , ' the death of radio ? ' , forthcoming ) . we are left with the need for higher - order theory work , not least to assure radio studies of its further existence . gaze 7 there still remains - not the ' gaze ' - but the radio glance . and i am very interested in the glances within radio drama , character glances , acting subtext , pauses and the angles of glances . edward branigan says of the glance on the screen ' a glance bristles with implications about space , time , and causality ' ( branigan , 1992 , 51 ) . the radio drama listener can experience characters ' glances and a lot else besides . this additional listener activity is what i term ' perceptual filling - in ' or ' the compensation that the listener makes for what radio has filtered out in its representation of the extra - radio world ' ( beck 2000a ; also beck 1997 ; beck 1998 ) . phenomenologists such as ingarden and fitch ( ingarden 1989 ; fitch 1991 ) , working on reception theory and the novel , have stressed the complexity of the reader 's concretisation of the fiction work within his or her mind . concretisation is an ongoing series of ' completions ' , where the fiction work is raised to the level of ' imaginational experience ' and scenes become ' fleshed out ' ( ingarden , 1989 , 333 - 4 ) . represented objects can never be completed ( 341 ) , that is , wholly ' filled in , ' as it were , by the reader 's imagination , in that process of the reader 's indwelling in the story world . only a few phenomena from the sum of phenomena in the fiction work are focused upon as central in the imagination at any particular moment . this explains why any two concretisations of the same work necessarily differ from each other ( 339 ) . now this focusing on a few central phenomena particularly suits the ongoingness of the radio drama scene , where regularly effects and music are separated from dialogue , in what i term standard production . radio 's ' economy ' is an obvious contrast to the instantaneous plenitude of the film sound track . ( see chion , 1994 , 55 for film 's plenitude . ) a second way into the listener 's imaginative meaning - making in the radio play is to make use of edward branigan 's ' schemata ' from his much admired narrative comprehension and film ( branigan 1992 ) . the film viewer relies on his or her own memory store , personal experiences and acquired knowledge . all these latter set expectations and principles of organisation . these are what branigan terms schemata ( frames , scripts ) . it is what branigan explains as ' top - down ' processing work on the incoming fictional data . of course in the lifeworld , such schemata operate too . these schemata are forms of cultural knowledge and are the scripts involved in , for example , buying groceries , making dinner , taking a trip , attending a seminar . ( see forrester , 2000 , 1.4 on our ' cultural repertoire ' and erving goffman for ' frames ' in his ' frame analysis ' , goffman 1974 . ) gaze 8 so a radio drama listener will perceptually fill in ' glances ' in characters ' dialogue , if that is the sort of concretisation or ' top - down ' schema processing that suits such and such an individual . and a radio drama listener will also experience a laura mulvey - teresa de lauretis - peggy phelan type of ' gaze ' , if that suits that individual . that is the active audience thesis ( watson and hill , 1997 , 2 ) . another very present factor is media intertextuality , and particularly the cross - over with tv and film . so my conclusion on importing or appropriating film ' gaze ' theory to radio is that such an attempt would turn out to be the disembodied , non - purposeful , abstract activity that rightly gives some theory - making a bad name . the risk of selectively borrowing pieces of theories is that the scholar may miss exactly those portions of one source that contradict the assumptions of others . ( see bordwell 1996 , 25 for film bricolage . ) this would create an impossible radio subject - position theory and one easily vulnerable to empirical objection . however , the intellectual problems remain - the gendered constructions of listening and of radio , and the deeper need for core radio theory ._. _ _ this investigation is intended to bring to light some reasons for connecting the notion of artificial life to certain kinds of interpretation of transcendental philosophy . since the conception of a machine has undergone an apparently decisive alteration in the post - newtonian world it will be part of the burden of this piece to suggest that the possibility of the evolutionary development of life beyond the organic is itself a product of new thought about the relation between the organic and the processes of interpretation and understanding that we have summarized under the heading � mind � . the ultimate point of the piece will be to suggest both that the underlying conceptual approaches to artificial life have serious deficiencies and to indicate that the development of which they are a part nonetheless has an essential relationship to futurity . the research programme of artificial life to begin setting out the argument that there is an intimate and creative connection between the project of artificial life and new interpretations of transcendental philosophy it will first be necessary to provide as clear an account as possible of what the research project of artificial life involves . this area of enquiry is still in the process of development and there are considerably rich debates between researchers as to the precise outlines of their province . however , christopher langton , the organizer of a series of conferences on this topic has provided an account of the general area both in a � preface � to the first volume of proceedings and in his own contribution to these proceedings . since the former includes a standard baseline account of the area in general i will begin with this before progressing to look at langton � s overall account as provided in his own article . whilst this will limit my account to a mere overview of the area and leave aside the difficulties involved in particular projects this approach will have the advantage of a high level of generality thus permitting easier access to the philosophical underpinnings of the whole research programme . in the � preface � to the first volume of proceedings langton describes what he terms � the distilled � essence � of artificial life � in the following manner : artificial life involves the realization of lifelike behavior on the part of man - made systems consisting of populations of semi - autonomous entities whose local interactions with one another are governed by a set of simple rules . such systems contain no rules for the behavior of the population at the global level , and the often complex high - level dynamics and structures observed are emergent properties , which develop over time from out of all of the local interactions among low - level primitives by a process highly reminiscent of embryological development , in which local hierarchies of higher - order structures develop and compete with one another for support among the low - level entities . these emergent structures play a vital role in organizing the behavior of the lowest - level entities by establishing the context within which those entities invoke their local rules and , as a consequence , these structures may evolve in time . ( langton , 1988 : xxii ) there are a number of important points within this short paragraph . artificial life is here understood as revealed to be present through the manifestation of certain types of behaviour pattern characteristic of living things . the cardinal distinction between local interactions and global connections allows for an extrapolation that there are occurring developments of a type whose pattern we have given in embryos . structures are taken to involve a high degree of order that requires support from lower - level entities , a support that is only available to those � life - forms � able to compete effectively for it . � emergent � structures govern the development of the lower - level entities by establishing a context within which they develop local rules and hence such rules come to � evolve � . since the � life � in question has to be man - made to count as artificial and since it is determined as � life � because there are � no rules for the behavior of the population at the global level � which latter condition indicates that there is openness in development which comes from self - organization we can see that this description marries one of the central tendencies within contemporary evolutionary theory to a set of machines whose existence is hence circumscribed as involving more than simply use by humans . langton offers an alternative and much briefer description of the research programme in his article contributed to the workshop : artificial life is the study of man - made systems that exhibit behaviors characteristic of natural living systems . it complements the traditional biological sciences concerned with the analysis of living organisms by attempting to synthesize life - like behaviors within computers and other artificial media . ( langton , 1988a : 1 ) the alteration of focus in this definition from the previous description of the � essence � of artificial life is instructive . whilst the former description utilized a sophisticated vocabulary of levels to orchestrate an understanding of the internal characteristics of the � life � form in question this definition simply relies on the behavioural criteria to state that the closeness of this phenomena to a � natural � one enables us to speak of life . the key difference however is that this second statement of langton � s clearly explicates the connection he sees between this research programme and the traditional activity of biological science . whereas biology is stated simply to look at the inner workings of organisms this research programme will demonstrate how to initiate the workings of organisms through constructing them . the presentation of a project of initiating the creation of life requires a very clear view of how the properties of � life � relate to the manifestations these have taken to date . hence langton states clearly that the research undertaken under the rubric of al views life ' as a property of the organization of matter , rather than a property of the matter which is so organized ' ( 1988:2 ) . hence life is given a formal rather than a material basis and the latter is comprehended as the province which biology has hitherto been concerned with . whilst this is one way in which the distinction between an � analytical � and a � synthetic � approach is to be understood it is not the most important one that langton provides . he adds that the approach of biology has been to view the organism as a whole entity and then to work downwards to an appreciation of its components whereas artificial life will instead start ' at the bottom , viewing an organism as a large population of simple machines ' and work upwards ( which is taken to be a � synthetic � method ) . this leads to a stark statement of the nature of how behaviours arise and what in sum � life � itself is taken to consist in : [ e]very part is a behav ior itself , and life is the behav ior that emerges from out of all the local interaction among individual behavors . it is this bottom - up , distributed , local determination of behavior that al employs in its primary methodological approach to the generation of lifelike behaviors . ( langton , 1988:2 - 3 . ) the distinction between � synthetic � and � analytical � approaches is not drawn in a manner that is traditional . a � synthetic � approach is understood by langton to involve subscription to a basic atomist presupposition that takes the elementary units of a form to be what basically produces the possibilities of that form . the departure from a strict atomistic approach undertaken through the reliance on the notion of � emergence � indicates however that whilst ' each part is a beha vior itself ' that it is only the interaction between the parts that involves the production of � life � . hence � life � itself emerges from a set of parts which themselves are each to be considered as active elements yet which only in combination are capable of performing the synthetic operation which gives us � lifelike � behaviours . the first question that arises about the endeavour to create artificial life therefore is how a set of elements which are not themselves truly � alive � can in combination be said to constitute a � life � . the rationale for thinking this possible emerges from both the understanding of evolutionary processes and the new type of comprehension of � machines � . with regard to the connection between the two we come upon the important notion of � program � . since the term � program � designates a control structure what is important about it is that this control structure is � abstract � in its operation , that is , it can be stated in a set of rules ' without regard to the material out of which the machine was constructed ' ( langton , 1988:11 ) . hence the basis of the machine is found not to rely on any particular components but rather in the code that is transmitted through these components . as langton puts it : today , the formal equivalent of a � machine � is an algorithm : the logic underlying the dynamics of an automaton , regardless of the details of its material construction . we now have many formal methods for the specification and operation of abstract machines , such as programming languages , formal language theory , automata theory , recursive function theory , etc . many of these have been shown to be logically equivalent . ( langton , 1988:11 ) if the machine is to be understood formally then it is reducible to the terms of a logic and this logic if stated in a number of distinct but formally equivalent ways is capable of running many different types of operation with a mere variation in the statement of the code . since the reduction of the machine to its logic is to understand machinery itself as simply a manifestation of coded statements in particular formats then the basic research programme of artificial life simply states an extension of the properties of machinery to life itself , understanding the latter as a set of coded elements in particular combinations . that this programme relies therefore on the work of watson and crick in terms of a new specification of living properties is clear but perhaps less clear is the extent to which the work of the latter already itself was based on translating the properties of � life � into those of machines . since the notion of � program � had already been applied to genetic material from the comprehension of computability as a general mechanism for the realization of code , life was comprehended in machinic terms , an achievement which then allows for the understanding of machinery itself as being a � life - form � . in order for this conceptual revolution to be plausible it is first necessary to re - present the theory of genetics in terms of a generalizable set of statements . this is done through exemplifying the notions of phenotype and genotype as notions permitting a coding which is not specific to any material . langton hence speaks of a gtype ( generalized genotype ) and a ptype ( generalized phenotype ) which are then described in terms of a recursive logic : ' the local developmental rules - the recursive description itself - constitute the gtype , and the developing structure - the recursively generated object or behavior itself - constitutes the ptype ' ( 1988:25 ) . since by this process a computer can simulate the characteristics of any machine we wish to instantiate it becomes possible to present complex behaviour based on simple rules and to see the rules as key to the behaviours we term � life � . whilst langton � s account of artificial life may not be in all respects equivalent to that adopted by others within the research programme its general parameters do not seem to be disputed . it will hence be relied on in the account i now wish to give of a convergence between the research programme and some leading interpretations of transcendental philosophy . conceiving transcendental philosophy as machinic the notion of artificial life is a development emergent from the research programme of artificial intelligence . what i wish to make clear in considering a particular line of interpretation of transcendental philosophy is how the gap between the notions of artificial life and artificial intelligence can be reconceived . this form of interpretation of transcendental philosophy will turn on showing how a functionalist theory of mind can be presented not as an empirical � discovery � but rather as a set of conditions for the possibility of representation occurring for a � mind � at all . reconceived in this way the functionalist account of mind will be thus conceived as the � inner truth � of transcendental philosophy . presenting this interpretation of transcendental philosophy will require drawing upon some contemporary readings of kant . the reading of kant i will be exploring is provided by andrew brook but before referring to his work in some detail and drawing out the sense in which it provides us with a linkage between intelligence and life in a manner which enables the gap between the programmes of ai and al to be considerably narrowed it will first be necessary to underline the limits of brook � s account and the aspects of it which i will not be accepting . brook considerably weakens his interpretation by presenting it as based on an empiricist notion of mental functioning which he opposes to the � cartesian � picture of mind which he imagines to be entailed by transcendental idealism . since it is a natural error for an empiricist to suppose that someone whose position is divergent from his own is a rationalist perhaps this notion of a � cartesian � transcendental idealism should not be entirely surprising . since it supports a radical failure on brook � s part to investigate the notion of � transcendental � beyond the level of imagining that there are � transcendental arguments � separable from any positive notion of philosophy the full possibilities of a functionalist form of transcendental philosophy can not be exploited by the author who is primarily responsible for alerting us to them . 1 with these very important caveats made it is plausible to construe the interpretation presented by andrew brook as providing us with a notion of transcendental functionalism which will enable us to see how the programs of ai and al can be brought together into a coherent whole . the key to brook � s interpretation is what he terms � apperceptive self - awareness � ( asa ) and , in examining the notion of it he takes kant to have , he states : at the first level � he argues ( 1 ) that we refer to ourselves � transcendentally � ( a355 ) , a kind of reference that is nonascriptive , and ( 2 ) that because the subject of representations must � presuppose � itself to think about itself , we must be nonascriptively aware of ourselves , and of ourselves as ourselves , to ascribe things to ourselves . then , at a deeper level , he explains ( 1 ) and at least aspects of ( 2 ) by an analysis of the nature of the representational base of asa and of the apperceptive acts we perform on that base . ( brook , 1994 : 71 - 2 ) beginning from this notion of a reference which involves no ascription of properties enables brook to suggest that at the base of information - processing is a broad and anonymous operation which does not require in any � thick � sense a consciousness of self . how then does this nonascriptive awareness arise ? this is equivalent as a question for brook as to how it is possible to generate a � base � representation of asa . brook indicates that this � base � is provided by an act of � transcendental apperception � that generates a � global representation � . since the � global representation � is the state of intentional directedness to a particular object conceived as the object that it is , it begins to appear that brook � s reconstruction of kant � s argument suggests that intentional relation to objects of representation is dependent upon ( and in some way brought about by ) this � transcendental apperception � , which is also the root of nonascriptive awareness of oneself as oneself . hence there is a root to both nonascriptive self - awareness and intentional relation to objects considered as unitary items of experience . how is this common root to be described and what entitles it to be presented as the unique basis of information processing ? the first point brook makes is that apperceptive self - awareness is distinct from most forms of self - awareness such as looking at oneself in the mirror due to the fact that asa involves being aware of oneself as a subject , not an object . since brook further interprets � object � as � intentional object � this commits him to the view that for kant there is a non - intentional relation which is the basis of intentionality and hence the basis of the possibility of mental processing in general including the self - ascriptive senses of � subjectivity � that we usually assume to be the ground of self - reference . this is explicated by brook in the following manner : when the act that makes me aware of myself is an act of global representing , i am aware of myself , not just as the subject of a single representation , but as the common subject of all of the representations included in the global object of that act of representing ; focusing on or paying attention to any one of them makes me aware of myself and that i am the subject of these representations . this awareness of myself as the common subject of multiple representations is the core of asa � .. i call it apperceptive because the acts of representing that yield it are acts of apperception , synthesizing acts of recognition . ( brook,1994:79 ) so if the core of apperceptive self - awareness is given in the transcendental unity of apperception and if the transcendental unity of apperception is also the basis for the synthesis of recognition in a concept that enables us to apply a rule of description to one thing through time and describe it as the same thing then there is an intrinsic interconnection between non - ascriptive self - awareness and object identification . this description of mental processing has as its direct consequence the result that self - identification is equated with the awareness of synthetic operations . as brook writes : ' i am aware of acts of ta [ transcendental apperception ] and of myself as their subject not by sensing them as the object of a representation but by doing them ' ( brook , 1994:80 ) . hence the distinction between the base of asa as given in ta and the presentation of identification of intentional states is that whereas in the former there is only awareness in the sense of action being understood to be taking place within the mind , in the latter there is an embedded difference between the intentional object and the awareness of an ability to relate to the intentional object as an object ( as it has to become an object for me and hence is distinct from me ) . in order to fill in how this model gives brook an account of information processing that allows a neutrality of material to be presupposed and hence permits a formality of comprehension which can allow us to postulate conditions in general of thinking we need to turn to a set of distinctions he makes between different forms of mental states , distinctions which in turn guide his comprehension of kant � s transcendental philosophy . brook sets out a difference between four different types of awareness . � awareness i � or � awareness ( information processing ) � is naturally the most basic notion brook uses and he describes it as involving : [ h]aving access to information about x such that either behavioural reactions to x that bear information about x or dispositions to react to x that bear information about x are set up ; dispositions can be either memories or dispositions other than memories . ( brook , 1994 : 48 ) whilst this is an intuitive base notion of awareness it alone seems very insufficient as whilst it gives some sense to a relation to intentional objects taking place in a set of processes it does not give us much comprehension of something acting for anything as an intentional object . to fill out the intentional nature of the intentional object further therefore brook supplements the notion of � awareness i � with a higher level of � awareness � , namely � awareness r � or � awareness , representation � which notion he fills out in the following manner : having access to x such that ( i ) awareness i is present and , in addition , ( ii ) behavior with respect to x can be explained only by reference to how x is represented to someone , not by how x actually is . ( brook , 1994 : 49 ) whilst this notion of � awareness � is clearly circular it captures a notion of � awareness � much fuller than � awareness i � and with the second condition we have given a sense that the object of which one is � aware � takes its properties from one � s type of awareness not from some independent state . this hence renders the object in question � intentional � rather than merely � objective � and in so doing makes it an item of � awareness � . that this still is insufficient for a full account of � awareness � seems to brook clear however in the sense that whilst we now have a comprehension of how an intentional object is represented to us it doesn � t involve an account of how reflective relationships to intentional objects can take place such that we can discover that the intentional object before the mind now is precisely the one necessary in order for us to achieve some set aim or purpose . the lack of ability of the two given notions of awareness to capture this ensures that a crucial element of intentionality is not yet given . hence brook sets out the notion of � awareness rr � or � awareness , representation , recognition � which is described as : ' being aware of x , plus recognizing x ' . ( brook , 1994 : 50 ) . the difficulty with this notion , a difficulty very quickly acknowledged by brook , is that it incorporates disparate types of � awareness � and that there is clear value in distinguishing between these . this constitutes a potential challenge to the third type of synthesis traced by kant in the transcendental deduction , the synthesis of recognition in a concept . brook suggests that there is a difference between recognition in a concept and recognition in consciousness and describes the former as � awareness rr - cc � and the latter as � awareness rr - cs � . in the former type of awareness we merely have the ability to apply one or more concepts to a representation whilst in the latter this ability has to be something that is reportable and this report indicates the recognition by the one making the report that they are making it . this last form of awareness is intimately related to the type of awareness involved when a recognition of something occurring is only possible because it is occurring , a state entitled by brook � awareness h � and defined by him as : ' recognizing a representational state one is having on the basis of having it ' . ( brook , 1994 : 53 ) this finally brings us to the base notion which brook has been seeking to justify , namely the situation whereby the relation between representer and represented is recognized as such and is , as such , the basis of the representation then being given . this is what brook means when he states : ' when one is aware not just of the object and oneself but of representing the object , it would seem that this representation is the representational base of all three acts of recognition , all three acts of awareness rr ' ( brook , 1994 : 81 ) . the awareness of oneself as subject is thus not a form of awareness like the other types traced as there is no � object � of awareness in this self - construal . there are not properties of oneself being recognised in the awareness that involves the recognition that one is aware of having awareness . ' it follows that , so far as anything my awareness of myself as subject could tell me , i could be any object or any compilation of objects or any succession of objects whatsoever . ' ( brook , 1994 : 90 ) the importance of this result as a reading of kant now needs to be drawn out and its relevance for both the notion of artificial life and the relationship between artificial life and artificial intelligence made clear . the result of brook � s reading is that it is both possible and desirable to undertake a discussion of kant � s philosophy that interprets it as presenting a functionalist account of mind . this possibility centres on the important double role of the transcendental unity of apperception . whilst it is presented by kant as ' the supreme principle of all use of the understanding ' ( b136 ) there is also a genetic approach to its role in the mind provided within the transcendental deduction that shows it arises from other mental activities . traditionally this argument is stated to have been made in the a - deduction and abandoned in the b - deduction . however , whilst the a - deduction provides us with reasons for seeing the transcendental unity of apperception as based upon the activity of imagination [ 2 ] what brook � s account makes clear is that there is a � subjective deduction � in the second edition of the first critique , a � subjective deduction � that makes the analytical priority of types of awareness that are not implicated in self - awareness talk over those types of awareness that are implicated in self - awareness talk clear . not only is this an interesting result for kant experts but it has strong implications for a relationship between a � kantian � theory of mind and the type of explanation we have seen given in langton of how an artificial life is organized . the proto - functionalist account of kant brings out a mutual relationship between the � synthetic � operation of levelling down to the base of � information processing � and levelling � up � to the opposite base of asa . the two types of base of mental functioning are co - dependent and co - producing which makes the premium placed upon the notion of consciousness as the action of an agent hard to sustain . hence the operations performed within a mind according to this reading of kant are similar in kind to those that would be performed in life by an artificial organism . just as the artificial organism could not relate to its environment except through an emergent logic so the kantian � machinic � intelligence requires a principle of supervenience for organisation to take place . this crucial connection also makes clear in what a link between artificial life and artificial intelligence would consist . both al and ai require a reference to action that arises not from a primary centre to the periphery but the converse , the organisation of a centre from the inter - locking emergent behaviour of the parts . this dependence of artificial forms upon a � bottom - up � approach does not prevent them from claiming a reference to life or intelligence if it is the case that intelligent life forms already require such a directional relation in order to function at all efficiently . the connections therefore between a proto - functionalist account of transcendental philosophy and the research programmes of artificial life and artificial intelligence become clear . in both cases there is a relationship between a highly general description that requires no reference to the matter organized and an intricate dependence upon functionalist inter - connection . in both cases this has the result of formulating a set of general conditions of possibility of intelligent life beyond the specific conditions of humanity . epigenesis , recursivity and teleology towards the close of the treatment of the transcendental deduction in the second edition of the critique of pure reason kant writes : now there are only two ways in which a necessary agreement of experience with the concepts of its objects can be thought : either the experience makes these concepts possible or these concepts make the experience possible . the first is not the case with the categories ( nor with pure sensible intuition ) ; for they are a priori concepts , hence independent of experience ( the assertion of an empirical origin would be a sort of generatio aequivoca ) . consequently only the second way remains ( as it were a system of the epigenesis of pure reason ) : namely that the categories contain the grounds of the possibility of all experience in general from the side of the understanding . ( b166 - 7 ) concepts of the understanding are justified immanently . kant , in closing the first critique , further argues that it is additionally the case that reason is immanently self - developing ( a835/b863 ) . this suggestion of a necessary immanence of rational principles and laws suggests that for cognition to be taking place there must be a relation between the elements of cognition and its overall grasp . this is an integral relationship , one described by kant in a number of places as � purposive � . kant took it be the case that such � purposive � relations where not available to what he termed � machines � and this is an important element of the critique of teleological judgment . the notion of � machine � with which kant was dealing was however one modelled on newtonian notions of physics and related to a network of efficient causes . the problem with the conception underlying the research programme of artificial life however is that the notion of � synthetic � organization within it flouts the fundamental principle of teleological connection expounded by kant . the reason for this is not primarily because of the fact that the � life � being spoken of is post - organic but that the principles governing the organization of the � life � in question are bound to leibnizian principles of relation and basically function as monads . the monadic organization is said to produce an emergent logical progression that depends upon an assumption of a pre - established harmony between the parts given . self - replication is only one of the principles of life - like organization . connected to it is a recursive connection between the parts organized , a connection requiring that the elements of the whole are effected by the organization they constitute in addition to forming such a whole . whilst a recursive connection between the gtype and the ptype is argued to be logically necessary by langton the relationship between this recursive logic and the emergent notion of organization is unclear . furthermore , in relation to the linkage suggested between the reading of transcendental philosophy thus far presented and al it is worth revisiting the structure of kant � s critique of pure reason from a different angle . thus far we have presented only a logical reconstruction of the transcendental deduction in which the b - deduction was patterned on the a - deduction . the recursive nature of reason is however insisted upon by kant in the � appendix � to the transcendental dialectic : if we survey the cognitions of our understanding in their entire range , then we find that what reason quite uniquely prescribes and seeks to bring about concerning it is the systematic in cognition , i.e. , its interconnection based on one principle . this unity of reason always presupposes an idea , namely that of the form of a whole of cognition , which precedes the determinate cognition of the parts and contains the conditions for determining a priori the place of each part and its relation to the others . accordingly , this idea postulates complete unity of the understanding � s cognition , through which this cognition comes to be not merely a contingent aggregate but a system interconnected in accordance with necessary laws . one can not properly say that this idea is the concept of an object , but only that of the thoroughgoing unity of these concepts , insofar as the idea serves the understanding as a rule . ( a645/b673 ) the possibility of the operations of the discursive understanding is provided to it by a rule of reason . this rule indicates that the possibility of progression in comprehension occurs through the following of the procedure of unificatory synthesis . as kant adds : ' for the law of reason to seek unity is necessary , since without it we would have no reason , and without that , no coherent use of the understanding , and , lacking that , no sufficient mark of empirical truth ; thus in regard to the latter we simply have to presuppose the systematic unity of nature as objectively valid and necessary ' ( a651/b679 ) . from the notion of systematic unity we derive logic itself , both in terms of such key formulations as occam � s razor ( a652/b680 ) and the possibility of applying logic to nature at all ( a654/b682 ) . the principle of all principles is purposiveness itself . without this principle that guides and directs the postulation of all other principles of investigation we would have no possibility of setting out to examine with precision the relations between phenomena . however , not only is the purposive unity postulated itself ' a mere idea ' ( a681/b709 ) but it is also subject to continuous modification as the discovery of new connections through the divisive operation of the understanding requires this . the nature of this constant revision indicates that the notion of purposive unity is a practical guide to investigation not an object of theoretical knowledge . this is the point at which the conception of artificial life presently given is shown to be problematic . since there is given in its conception only an emergent logic the operation of the life - form does not permit cognition in the ultimate sense of grasping the notion of law - like connection and nor is the � life - form � in question itself governed by such connection . this failure of harmony between the artificial life and the organic is decisive for the mechanistic basis of the former and prevents it from being cognisable as operated according to transcendental principles . recursive operations are said to operate only once the level of complexity of the � life - form � given in artificial life experiments has sufficiently � emerged � whilst transcendental accounts require this complexity to make possible the notion of � awareness � in general . hence artificial life forms lack epigenetic organization and in fact have the status of � machine � in kantian terms not because of the stuff from which they are made but because of the logical interactions which govern their operation and their possibility of comprehension . this also indicates the crucial link between ai and al as being mutually harmful in cognitive principles . futurity , machinery and life whilst the above considerations suggest a lack of future for the research programme of artificial life there is another way of addressing the nature of the project involved which indicates quite contrary conclusions and enables a final harmonization between the outlines of this area and a machinic notion of transcendental philosophy . this is provided from the work of bernard stiegler . working from across the divide between philosophy and anthropology , stiegler has presented some original reflections on the nature of technicity . writing about the nature of tools stiegler refers to their capacity to � store � information that transcends the life - spans of organic individuals . the capacity of a storing system that survives those who have apparently � invented � it to be accumulatively invested in by future generations requires a reflection on the relation between organic and non - organic forms . if the individual is organic organized matter , then its relation to the environment ( to matter in general , organic or inorganic ) , when it is a question of a who , is mediated by the organized but inorganic matter of the organon , the tool with its instructive role ( its role qua instrument ) , the what . it is in this sense that the what invents the who just as much as it is invented by it . ( stiegler , 1994 : 177 ) according to this analysis the emergence of recursivity is given in the relation between the organic and the technical . the relation between them is one of interlocking and mutually interactive development in which the progressive organization of a gigantic � memory � takes place . new memorizations facilitate that which they have anticipated and life is available to be seen as part of a vast enterprise of � programmability � . if the relation between organic and inorganic is what is recursive and the self - relation of the organism is constituted through technical supplementarity then there is in principle no problem with viewing � artificial life � as coterminuous with culture itself . this was also the conclusion of kant � s critique of teleological judgment : ' producing in a rational being an aptitude for purposes generally ( hence [ in a way that leaves ] that being free ) is culture ' ( ak. 5 : 431 ) . culture is the capacity to act and think purposively , being - in - community is to be able to work , that is , to be free . but this development is a product of what hegelians ( following here kant ) term � second nature � or artificial life . the increasing complexification of the outward manifestation of the gigantic � memories � which make possible activities of a type which are responsible for futurity just is the process of reaching for the self - conscious programme of conceiving of programmability itself as the development of life . the development of programmability as an end - in - itself is the self - surpassing of the human on the basis of its own premises of development . put within this larger context the surprisingly limited conceptions of artificial life to date are merely a consequence of failure to reflect on the conditions of possibility of being able to theorize on artificiality at all . reaching the horizon of reflection which permits this is to see that the transcendental nature of organicity permits and enforces an � artificial � environment as the ability to plan is part of an anticipatory systematisation that lacks final horizon ( is � infinitely open � ) . this way of phrasing the situation of the arrival of the post - human future indicates that the human has never been one with itself , is that which is incapable of being � at - home � and whose historicity is never past but futural . given the transcendental perspective of purposiveness we can now see that whilst the thought of teleological connection indicates a problem with seeing the research programme of artificial life as being concerned truly with life this is purely because of the self - limitation of enquiry which this programme has allowed itself to be given . if artificial life is taken as the futural name of transcendental philosophy then the way is open for conceiving its products and programme as nothing other than the search of the future for itself . endnotes [ 1 ] it is also worth mentioning at least once that the notion of � mind � is a weak translation of kant � s gemut . for an account of the full complexities of this term in kant see howard caygill ( 1995 ) a kant dictionary . oxford : blackwell .

" 37th over : england 108 - 2 ( cook 49 , pietersen 15 ) kumble drifts to leg and pietersen whips him through midwicket for four - a risk - free stroke executed to perfection . two more follow with a shovel to midwicket as kumble drops short , and this is good , positive batting from pietersen . his back trouble does n't seem to be affecting him at all . 38th over : england 109 - 2 ( cook 50 , pietersen 15 ) harbhajan continues over the wicket to cook , who has been circumspect since lunch , but then fiddles outside off and is beaten by one that turns slightly . that 's his first real indiscretion outside off - stump . but there 's his fifty , courtesy of a tickle to fine leg . what a start to his test career ! 39th over : england 110 - 2 ( cook 51 , pietersen 15 ) cook 's half - century came up off 113 balls , with six fours , most of them on the off - side . his singles were picked up almost exclusively on the leg - side . i think we 'll be seeing a lot more of him in the years ahead . but before i get too misty - eyed , back comes s sreesanth into the attack in place of kumble ( 8 - 2 - 21 - 0 ) . he has a nice , high action , and makes cook play in that over . a maiden is spoiled by a loose final delivery which cook clips to long leg for a single . 40th over : england 110 - 2 ( cook 51 , pietersen 15 ) kumble now comes on at the other end in place of harbhajan as india seek the third berakthrough , but cook is standing firm . it 's cat - and - mouse out there right now , and they 're playing chess . any other cliches gratefully received as kumble completes a maiden . " afternoon boothers , this time from singapore , " writes tristan haley - burrows . " too much cricket chat so far this series and not enough inanity . the main advantage of having two spinners on is that it takes less pressing of f5 before a new over commentary appears . " i hate it when two spinners are on , tristan . it does nothing for the rsi . wicket ! pietersen b sreesanth 15 ( 110 - 3 ) after being badly dropped by laxman at second slip , pietersen puts himself out of his misery by dragging a not - very - short ball onto his leg - stump as he goes on the pull against sreesanth . not a great shot in the circumstances , but just reward for a very fine over . " i made the mistake of asking some aussies i work with over here in melbourne where i could watch england play , and was met with first , a deathly silence , secondly , a whole heap of ' pom ' jokes , " writes erin jones . " so , still left in the dark about where to watch it , resorting to the good old obo . " 41st over : england 110 - 3 ( cook 51 , collingwood 0 ) the next hour and a quarter before tea could be make or break for england . if they lose two more wickets , they can probably kiss this test goodbye . 42nd over : england 111 - 3 ( cook 52 , collingwood 0 ) a lot depends on cook now , which is asking a lot of a 21-year - old . but if he can resist the temptation to play crazy shots on a flat pitch , why could n't strauss and pietersen ? what exactly were the lessons england were supposed to have learned in pakistan ? cook squeezes kumble into the leg - side for a single to keep the strike . 43rd over : england 113 - 3 ( cook 53 , collingwood 0 ) sreesanth is getting the ball to reverse - swing now , which makes the absence of simon jones all the more galling . but cook is equal to the task . he does n't get a huge stride in , but it 's bigger than trescothick 's , and he has an excellent eye . he 's uncomplicated rather than flamboyant , and it works for him . meanwhile , problems for sreesanth who has just been warned for the second time about running on the pitch . one more warning and he wo n't be able to bowl again in the innings , so sreesanth decides to go round the wicket instead , and promptly sends down a no - ball which cook whips to midwicket for a single . 44th over : england 115 - 3 ( cook 54 , collingwood 1 ) cook takes yet another leg - side single off a spinner as kumble drifts onto leg - stump , before collingwood gets off the mark with a nudge to long - leg for one more . " you can sympathise with kp , " says nick brice . " if sreesanth is the same as santh in the stickcricket , he is impossible to time properly . mind you , i was hoping for a moment that the drop earlier would bring us a repeat of the oval . 400 is looking a very long way away . " 45th over : england 119 - 3 ( cook 54 , collingwood 5 ) collingwood clips sreesanth off his toes through midwicket for four - perhaps those two warnings are playing on the bowler 's mind . having said that , he almost sneaks a yorker through collingwood 's defences shortly afterwards . " what a horrendous shot kevin played , " writes yajnaseni chakraborty in kolkata . " i bet even the barmy army are silenced . they are not on tv just now , but i can only admire their heroism as they battle the nagpur heat . " there are n't many of them , yajnaseni . but they 're making their presence felt . 46th over : england 123 - 3 ( cook 58 , collingwood 5 ) kumble goes round the wicket to cook to give him a new angle to think about , but cook simply flicks him on the up through midwicket - what a shot that was ! he needed it too , because his score was in danger of stagnating . " kevin pietersen at it again , " seethes david williams . " out to a stupid shot , while a 21-year - old shows him how to bat with application . great one day batsman , but barring one innings vs australia ( where he was dropped twice early on playing silly shots ) he 's averaging low - mid 30s in test cricket . " 47th over : england 131 - 3 ( cook 58 , collingwood 13 ) on comes irfan pathan , but his first ball is a leg - stump half - volley and collingwood picks up four through his favourite midwicket region . his second is leg - stumpish too , and collingwood collects four more , this time off his hip just behind square . good stuff from england - they need to pick up the run - rate here . " my mate rob has been banging on about cook for about four years now ( they went to the same school , although different eras ) , " reports james huxtable . " i 'm glad he 's playing well but i think rob will be insufferable today , especially if he goes on to make a ton . " 48th over : england 131 - 3 ( cook 58 , collingwood 13 ) kumble gievs the ball a bit more air as he tries to persuade cook to do something silly , but silly is not a word that applies to his batting . a careful maiden . i asked for more cliches and andy bowles has well and truly come to the party . " let 's hope that pietersen 's wild and woolly dismissal does n't open the floodgates , " he begins . " if england show any weakness india will give no quarter . mind you , not to count our chickens before they 're hatched , but i 'm quietly confident : cook looks as solid as a rock , and collingwood has a reputation for being touch in a pinch . i do n't think either of them will fold under the pressure , however daunting their task . if cook plays his cards right he could score a maiden century , which would be worth its weight in gold . of course , even if we build a big total that 's only the first hurdle , but we 'll cross that bridge when we come to it . " 49th over : england 131 - 3 ( cook 58 , collingwood 13 ) pathan is making the occasional ball come back into the right - handed collingwood , but there is no great movement for him , bar a touch of reverse . another maiden . rachel clifton has some thoughts on kp 's new hair . " although surely everyone 's first reaction was one of relief that the badger stripe had gone , did anyone else immediately think chris lewis , west indies , laughable sunstroke ? or was that just me ? " 50th over : england 133 - 3 ( cook 59 , collingwood 13 ) this has been slow going by england - just 15 runs in 80 minutes since lunch for cook - as kumble oversteps going round the wicket . that was a harsh call by aleem dar . cook then pushes a rare off - side single , and it 's a quick one too as sachin tendulkar tries to throw down the stumps from extra - cover and misses . " i think it 's time the pietersen - bashing stopped , " says patrick stone . " ok , he got out to a stupid shot , but he has played very well for england at times , and i do remember a young andrew flintoff getting out to the odd rash shot in his early days . " i quite agree . 8.37am update pathan oversteps for the fifth time before sky 's pictures go on the blink , leaving me in obo no - man 's land - a hideously soulless place . " i 've had a disastrous financial week , " says tom van der gucht . " i had laid 20 sheets on england winning the grand slam and a tenner on them to paste the jocks by between 31 and 35 points . my account was bled further by a crash - and - burn date with a woman who waited until after i had forked out on a four - course dinner and an evenings worth of drinks before announcing that she only liked me as a friend . my last ray of hope rests on the shoulders of new look england winning the series and the cash i laid down with my turf accountants yesterday . " 8.38am and now we hear that cook is out ! 136 - 4 , and england are in a spot of bother now . 8.42am " nasser on sky at lunch was saying england would be disappointed if they only get 350 , " says andy bradshaw . " am i the only one who would be chuffed if we actually managed to get anywhere near 300 . " you 're not , andy . cook 's dismissal might well have opened the floodgates . still no pictures , i 'm afraid . gah ! 8.45am this really is frustrating : no pictures , so i have no idea what 's going on . freddie 's probably scored his century . " i am constantly amazed by the attacks on pietersen 's batting by a dismissal off the scorebooks the brilliant 158 because he was dropped twice , " says andrew blacoe . " now david williams is ignoring it for the purposes of calculating the lad 's average . are opta index going to produce two averages for each player : the real one , and the one they really should have had if the umpiring / fielding had been up to scratch ? gooch was dropped on 36 on his way to 333 , so does that mean he loses 297 to his aggregate tally ? fair enough criticise the lad for his temperament / hair cut / bottom - hand , but let 's not deny him a truly great sporting effort . " 53rd over : england 138 - 4 ( collingwood 14 , flintoff 2 ) we 're back ! i 'll bring you details of cook 's wicket as soon as i have it . 54th over : england 141 - 4 ( collingwood 15 , flintoff 2 ) two leg - byes as england 's third captain in four tests tries to work kumble to leg . there are 20 minutes to go before tea and it 's vital for england that this pair are still in occupation . " does n't david lloyd on sky look like the new president ( of the usa ) in the latest series of 24 ? " suggests thomas priestley . 55th over : england 150 - 4 ( collingwood 16 , flintoff 10 ) cook , incidentally , was bowled by pathan for 60 off the inside edge as he tried to drive a full - length ball that swung late . several of you have pointed out that the header at the top of the page reads pakistan v england . i know . and i ca n't do anything about it for the time being . believe me , if i could change it , i would . and there 's four lucky runs for flintoff , who pokes pathan between first and third slip and away for four . and , no , there was n't a second slip . the next ball is driven wide of third slip , except third slip had reverted to second slip after the previous delivery . four more fortunate runs to england . 56th over : england 150 - 4 ( collingwood 16 , flintoff 10 ) harbhajan probes around collingwood 's off - stump , but if there 's one player who is n't going to throw it away , it 's collingwood . a maiden . 57th over : england 150 - 4 ( collingwood 16 , flintoff 10 ) sreesanth returns to the attack and india sense that they might be able to knock england over for well under 300 . or am i simply transferring my own concerns onto dravid and his team ? both , probably . that was a maiden as the sky feed dries up again . " i 'd heartily recommend the redback tavern on flemington road in melbourne to daniel marks ( over 32 ) to go watch the rest of england 's innings , " says jon casemore . " i 'd advise him to hurry mind , the tram takes a full 5 minutes to get up there from the centre of town . he might catch the tail enders if he leaves now . " 58th over : england 156 - 4 ( collingwood 22 , flintoff 10 ) collingwood cuts harbhajan for four , but the pictures have disappeared once more . charles colvile is not looking impressed in the sky studio . " sky lose their pictures while radio 4 lw decides to put on some rubbish about parliament for half an hour , " complains ben day . " suddenly cook is out . in my bitterness , i blame media coverage . for everything . " 59th over : england 157 - 4 ( collingwood 22 , flintoff 11 ) and that 's tea . join me at 9.30am gmt to see whether england can inch towards respectability ._. _ _ lynne cooke what is particularly interesting about the exhibition � art & the 60s : this was tomorrow ' is that , for the first time , it brings architecture and photography together with the fine arts at tate britain . normally , as you probably know , architecture and photography fall under the aegis of the victoria and albert museum , which was founded to concentrate on the applied arts considered from a pedagogical perspective . unlike moma in new york or the pompidou in paris , tate 's mandate does not include these disciplines . rem koolhaas was this a formal arrangement ? lynne cooke i think it was formalised early in the twentieth century . in recent years , however , it has broken down with regard to photography because so many artists today , such as thomas struth , practise as photographers . but with architecture , as far as i know , there has been no integration as yet . rem koolhaas was that due to the narrowness of the times ? lynne cooke well , it was also something to do with the status of architecture and photography at that moment . even in the 1960s , when there was so much talk of crossovers between the various art forms , architects seemed to stand somewhat apart . for example , the openings of the two key galleries of the time � kasmin and robert fraser � were attended by a very diverse crowd that included marlon brando , stanley kubrick and the rolling stones , but as far as i know , no major architects . when you went to study in london in the late 1960s did you have a sense that architects were part of a larger scene ? rem koolhaas yes , very much so . i think it was a really interesting moment � a time when any communication was questioned , when it was far from self - evident . it 's infinitely more parochial now . lynne cooke in the sense that there is less engagement with artists from other fields ? rem koolhaas on the surface there is more engagement � you have only to look at the architecture magazines to see it . but in practice there is n't , and that 's mutual . for example , if you read the art magazine frieze , particularly in the past five years , you find that it 's really withdrawing into its own territory , art � it 's amazing . the great thing about 1960s architecture in the uk is that it was realised in sites that are so accessible all these buildings are still around , and in the normal course of things you see many of them , some once a week . rem koolhaas and lynne cooke in conversation at the fairmont olympic hotel , seattle , 2004 photograph : adam l. weintraub , 2004 lynne cooke yes , but you see richard seifert 's centrepoint or any of those other key 1960s buildings in the middle of what is still today essentially a victorian or edwardian city . for all the discussion of a radically changing streetscape , of the re - urbanisation of london , these modernist buildings seem like nodes inserted into something that was n't fundamentally changed . rem koolhaas that is an interesting point . in europe , change is either resisted or wholesale � in london , you wonder whether cumulative change is not a very smart way of changing ? maybe the latter makes a little more sense . i 've always felt that because the british do n't have strong theoretical ambitions � because they are sentimental � they have an interesting inability to implement things on a theoretical level . if you look at denys lasdun 's keeling house , it 's sensational precisely for that reason . never claiming that the whole context should be erased , the british actually got away with this kind of intervention . meanwhile , everyone else in europe was trying to erase everything and so never got to the point of creating this eloquent interface between old and new . lynne cooke but how good do you think most of the buildings were ? was compromise inevitable with this kind of intervention ? rem koolhaas ironically , because so much of it was built for the public good , we now tend to think that it was compromised � simply because it was not � unique � and had no signature . what was generated in a spirit of benevolence looks impoverished to us , because we need the iconic to begin to pay attention . lynne cooke and we 're now talking of patrick hodgkinson 's brunswick centre housing project , which was not the worst by any means . rem koolhaas no . we can , of course , raise the issue of quality , but at the same time we can only regret the way our own expectations have become infiated , burdened with aesthetic and material demands that those people quite heroically decided to forego . in some ways we are very spoiled . if you look at neave brown 's alexandra road estate , you can see that we now demand luxuries , such as certain textures , that they were con.dent enough to have purged . lynne cooke does this imply that the aesthetic aspect is something of an overlay that can be added or subtracted ; that it is n't integral from the beginning ? rem koolhaas basically , there used to be an absolutely immediate and direct connection between architecture and an ideology of equality . today , we find this hard to take , aestheti - cally . in a way that was largely unconscious we abandoned that connection : even if our heart is in the right place , we are excited by the exceptional and enjoy master - pieces . for me this situation raises a question not only here in england , but when i go from west berlin to east berlin , or when i travel to moscow : the levels of luxury and surfeit in which we indulge now become very apparent in those zones of former equality . cedric price cover design for generator , to accompany his exhibition at the waddington gallery , 1981 � hillingdon press ( westminster press ) lynne cooke is that a product of the type of architecture that dominated the 1990s � buildings that were generated by the private as opposed to the public sector ? rem koolhaas they were connected to profit : they changed the city , yet they were not connected to urban change . lynne cooke do you mean they were isolated � autonomous � rather than integrated ? rem koolhaas yes . a self - evident consequence of the pro.t motive is the fact that most of the changes to the city were not made according to any established programme or ambition . many of the buildings of the 1960s are really clumsy and awkward , but even if they have few aesthetic virtues or qualities , they do have a sense of being deliberate , of being part of a plan or blueprint . lynne cooke as with manchester 's piccadilly plaza or the bull ring in birmingham , many uk cities had their centres � their hearts � redesigned . are they identifiable or distinguishable from each other ? do you think that was important ? rem koolhaas the beauty of , for example , covell & matthews 's piccadilly plaza is that people were so convinced , so secure in their sense of what london or manchester was that they could even see the programmatic aspects [ of the design ] � their deliberate neutrality � as a contribution to their status . i 'm always really astonished at the simplicity of what architects could get away with then . by contrast , it 's almost obscene what we 're forced to produce now . ironically , � identity � has become one of those obligations . we are in a very invidious moment in the sense that although we may not explicitly condone capitalist virtues , we contribute to the cult of identity , often at the expense of the authenticity that easily coexisted with the more na � ve architecture of our immediate predecessors . lynne cooke does that mean public housing projects are no longer possible ? rem koolhaas they 're no longer possible , or at least nobody does them . lynne cooke you 've spoken a lot about cedric price and how important he was . you have also argued that ideologues or theorists have n't really played a very strong role in britain . since he built almost nothing , how do you reconcile this apparent contradiction ? rem koolhaas i think cedric price did unbelievable things . he was an ideologue but not a theorist . in general , i am very sceptical that you can be theoretical in architecture , because there is really no theory . there are precedents , directions and movements which generate forms : it 's very important to separate that from theory . the most interesting part of price for me is that while he was , in a certain way , an arch nostalgic and conservative , ultimately , his most radical and innovative contribution was his relentless and endless questioning of the claims and pretensions of architecture and architects . he was a sceptic torturing a conservative discipline . so , the 1960s are very compelling in two ways . on the one hand there 's the scale and the sincerity and earnestness of the effort , and , on the other , the ruthlessness of the questioning of that very effort by people such as price . presumably , there is an internal connection between the two : he could only be ruthless because the period produced strong and compelling forms . lynne cooke yet there are curious anomalies in this situation . for example , not only the architec - tural historian nikolaus pevsner but also peter and alison smithson tried to preserve the eighteenth - century streetscapes of bath and the euston arch in london . that is , both the conservative and the more vanguard positions encompassed a strong sense of history and accorded it a role or place in the present , even while they did not share a belief in what should be built in relation to what remained of the past . almost nobody advocated a tabula rasa � the idea of starting again with a clean slate � as the way forward . rem koolhaas the whole issue of the tabula rasa is really interesting . i believe that a sense of history is ingrained in architecture probably more solidly than in any other profes - sion . for instance , the average architecture student knows more of history than the average painter does . our fundamental genetic material is so ancient . i am not surprised � and i would n't call it a form of conservatism either � that such elements as the euston arch would be an issue for preservation . i ca n't imagine a single architect at that moment proposing to get rid of it � except , maybe , in the interests of commercial development . the myth of the tabula rasa has had a very interesting life in architecture . it was proposed in the 1920s more as a poetic than as a literal notion . then in the post - war world it flipped over , becoming the most serious crime that an architect could ever commit . it was at first a form of propaganda used by architects to make their case more vividly and , presumably , also to advance their careers , but then it became the propaganda of the non - architects against architects . flyer for the koolhaas talk � programmatic instability ' , 14 april 1989 at the georgia institute of technology 's college of architecture � andrew seward duncan collection lynne cooke the most extreme case would be le corbusier . rem koolhaas i never believed that there was a serious effort to be anti - historical , even with iconoclasts such as le corbusier � it is mostly a myth that has turned against architecture as an inescapable form of original sin . lynne cooke you mean he did n't intend to execute his programme ; he did n't intend to raze a large part of paris ? rem koolhaas no . i 'm sure that he chose the most beautiful part of paris simply to make his point . you should also not forget that after the second world war there were actually many tabula rasa situations that existed for other reasons , independent from architecture . i think somebody should write a really serious history of the tabula rasa ; i 'm sure you would discover some incredible discrepancies compared with the official story . for example , i 'm totally convinced that a project such as peter and alison smithson 's one for robin hood gardens was in every sense conceptualised to coexist with all its then neighbours and the norms of that kind of context . lynne cooke in different ways richard hamilton and peter reyner banham , who seem to me to be the other key figures of this era , embrace these poles , forging a new alliance between the overtly modern and the historic . banham 's seminal book theory and design in the first machine age ( 1960 ) basically rewrites the history of early twentieth - century architecture to accord futurism a formative role . at the same time , he was writing paeans to innovative automobile design and new industrial objects . he 's very typical of a key strand in british culture of the 1960s . rem koolhaas i think the so - called purism which architects are often accused of is a projection , almost a hope � the rest of the world hopes that we , at least , have remained pure . architecture is a strange trope because it is so associated with elimination , with purism and intolerance , that both within its own domain and outside any sort of ambiguity is immediately considered an inconsistency . to the outside world the consistency of architecture is a given , from which you deviate at your own peril � which is ironic since it would be much better , and much more interesting , for the world at large if there were more deviations . lynne cooke by the 1960s there was a big contrast between britain and the united states , where the notion of the tabula rasa was polemically invoked by artists ranging from barnett newman to tony smith and donald judd , variations on a well - rehearsed desire to leave the past behind . when you were writing delirious new york in new york in the early 1970s , did you feel you were writing from within a milieu in which this was still a current notion ? rem koolhaas this may seem a subtle difference , but it 's not unimportant . although 1972 seems , in several fundamental ways , part of the 1960s , i would say that delirious new york was written more as a polemic against the first signs of post - modernism in architec - ture , rather than as an argument against modernity . this is definitely a book about europe and america � it was dissatisfaction with the mentality in europe that drove me to write it � but , at the same time , i was using a former america against the post - modern america . so in that sense it had a double agenda . my ambition with delirious new york was to identify and put on the map another modernism . we europeans are reasonably conversant with the ideas of suprematism , dadaism and surrealism , but we know little about the world of experimentation that occurred in parallel in the united states : america 's inter - war modernism . it seemed important to identify that particular form of modernism , because in the us historicism and post - modernity were being glorified . if you look at the 1970s , there were moments when our office and a few others really seemed deeply isolated in maintaining any interest in the issue of modernity . lynne cooke why did you leave britain for the united states ? were you dissatisfied with what was happening in architecture in the uk ? rem koolhaas now , when i look back with you at pictures of 1960s britain , i can respond more positively to the puritanism than i could when i was a student . then the puritanical aspect of architecture upset me . the reason i left europe was a frustration with the limitations imposed on architecture , with the limited way in which the growing interest in the historical city launched by people such as aldo rossi was used to discredit architecture . lynne cooke you left britain in 1972 . later banham left , along with a lot of other people who had been looking closely at the states during the 1960s . cedric price did n't , and he built almost nothing . do you think his contribution would have been different if he had worked in the us , or did he depend on this state of confrontation ? rem koolhaas that 's a really interesting question . he did participate in competitions abroad , for example for la villette in paris . if my memory is correct , i think he also proposed projects for an estate somewhere in florida . he journeyed regularly to america and also to countries that considered themselves as outposts of the london discourses . it is fascinating that he is making such an incredible comeback . i 'm not sure anyone really knows why . maybe in some way he represents our guilty conscience � lynne cooke and unexplored directions ? rem koolhaas yes . if i look at the new library in seattle , maybe in a pathetic way we are trying to be cedric price the folding and the facets of this building are actually quite close � in terms of their diagrammatic machine - like quality � to price 's aviary for london zoo . there are many features of that moment . front cover of reyner banham 's theory and design in the first machine age � the architectural press , london , 1960 lynne cooke i wonder if you could trace another lineage that went from the idea of price 's fun palace � as a kind of non - hierarchical cultural goods yard where people would constantly re - position elements in order to have different art forms come into play � and the pompidou as it was originally conceived , or your project for the los angeles county museum of art . rem koolhaas i do n't know a single person who does n't believe that the pompidou was derived from or intimately connected with the fun palace in some way . but lacma is not a free - for - all , nor even a non - hierarchical situation . it is more an attempt to deal with the encyclopedic museum in general . whereas the pompidou is basically a loft - building on several levels , with the lacma proposal i attempted to exploit what is theoretically the greatest potential for an encyclopedic museum � that it enables the display of parallel developments , across time . it offers an overview of several time - lines running in parallel . in an historical museum , periods and categories are � put in their place � . they have their own section , wing or pavilion . the essence of lacma is that it was set on a single plate , presented as an historical grid in which every kind of thing could be positioned so that you could see cultures develop in time , and make cross - references between them . you can never do that in a building with different levels or sections . lynne cooke but its whole is contained within a neutral frame ? rem koolhaas but i think the form was not neutral . in the first proposal it was perhaps more neutral . we were to present it on 12 september 2001 . after 11 september , the presentation was postponed and in the interval we modified it drastically . lynne cooke what were the paradigms that moved it away from neutrality ? rem koolhaas somehow , after 11 september neutrality felt too cold . it was nothing more concrete than that , but it helped us to move to a proposal that was less clinical . if you ask for reasons in architecture , it is always delicate , because things have to be presented as reasons or as reasonings , even if they are simply intuitive leaps or adjustments to contingencies . lynne cooke do you think the fun palace idea is not viable at this moment ? rem koolhaas i think that could be true . maybe tate shows the extent to which it is no longer possible , because the empty space at tate modern could be seen as the fun palace and it would be very exciting if it worked , but it has become a severely pro - grammed museum space . there 's none of the blurring of those earlier times : we demand clarity and consistency from our artists today , so maybe that prohibits a leaking from one area to another . although there is more multi - disciplinary activity now , it seems too programmed to lead to the sort of discoveries that were made then . lynne cooke the other idea of cedric price 's i wanted to ask you about is his notion of magnets as distinct from iconic statements � buildings which are integrated in a context , which imply a certain degree of cohesion rather than standing out as signature statements ? rem koolhaas you have to consider that price was lucky in a certain way : most of his work and most of his statements were made before the whole idea of a signature even emerged . it 's the most corrosive idea . at this moment it creates an incredible pressure because it is inescapable . there 's no way to outwit it . but maybe you can ignore it , with more or less effort . so while i sympathise with his notion on a fundamental level , in our culture it 's almost untenable , because so much has to � pay off � somehow � literally . lynne cooke there is an implicit claim in the � art & the 60s ' show that both the 1960s and the 1990s were extraordinary moments in british culture . rem koolhaas the 1990s were exciting mostly because of the internationalism of the country , but they did n't have any internal relationship with the 1960s . the special thing about the 1960s in the uk was that people were able to be simultaneously parochial , creative and innovative � and usually those three do n't go together . they were geniuses in cultivating that . there were totally bizarre fairytales , very myopic and intensely idiosyncratic engagements with certain contextual moments but still generating a surprisingly wide field of discovery . so i think the main difference between the 1960s and the 1990s was that the 1960s constituted maybe the last parochial moment , but one that was used almost as a tool . when i came to the architectural association in 1968 , there was a dining room with waitresses and a fireplace . it was an incredible scene , because the most moribund elements of english culture were being used as props against which the avant - garde could perform its tricks . there was a mutual reassurance and interdependency for the avant - garde to know that there was this background , and for the background to know that it was the last spasm of a particular culture that could n't last . there was a great pleasure in it , i think . that kind of role - playing is almost absent now because , basically , you can no longer have the luxury of the foreground and background : everything has become the foreground . lynne cooke yes , the courtauld institute , which was then located in a robert adam house , was like that too . the teaching faculty walked down the grand ceremonial staircase , while the students had to use the back staircase � the one designed for the servants . yet everyone ate together in the small , tacky caf � which was valiantly run by a single woman . while full of contradictions , the courtauld was actually very productive . rem koolhaas you can probably trace the flattening of a certain culture with the modernisation of bars and of interiors � with minimalism raising its head everywhere . taste . lynne cooke this brings us back to the idea you stated earlier : that today we require ever more luxurious settings . this completely undermines the makeshift . rem koolhaas makeshift is a beautiful word . it connected with banham and price , but we can not handle it anymore . � art & the 60s : this was tomorrow ' , tate britain , until 25 september . then touring to gas hall , birmingham , 25 october � 3 april 2005 . lynne cooke has been a curator at dia art foundation , new york , since 1991 and is a writer on contemporary art . rem koolhaas is an architect and director of oma , rotterdam . this conversation took place at the fairmont olympic hotel , seattle , on 17 july 2004 . in this issue ... architecture and the sixties sound waves : bruce nauman six reflections on robert frank " if we are to do beatiful pictures ...

' dinner ' comes the reply . 8.05 the turkey has been taken out of the oven ; pj helps himself to a few scraps of it . jonny asks lee if he 'll dish up equal shares for everyone . 8.06 the housemates gather around the kitchen area , plates in hand , to tell sandy how much of each food they want . kate wonders whether she should sit in sunita 's chair at the dining table . 8.07 the housemates begin to sit at the tables with their dinner . adele observes that anyone watching them will think they 're very healthy having only water to drink with their meals rather than wine . lee asks jonny if he 's got enough to eat , and also tells adele that they 'll ' have a real good chat ' later on . 8.08 alison compliments that the dinner is ' absolutely lovely ' , as jonny tells the housemates that he 's leaving the bread in the kitchen to cool down ; he is also finding it difficult to cut . 8.11 jonny wonders if the salt canister is working properly as it does n't seem to be depositing any on his meal . 8.16 lee gets a rousing response , mainly from the girls , after asking the housemates if they want any apple pie for dessert . alex advises him how it should be cooked , as pj and adele finish their meals . 8.17 alex encourages kate to finish her meal completely ; jade does , and jonny asks her whether she wants any bread afterwards . 8.18 pj begins the washing up ; adele and lee go to the kitchen to finish it . alison encourages jade to do tomorrow 's cooking , as spencer tries to get her to fetch the eggs in from the chicken coop ; she does n't want to do it as she is not very keen on getting her boots mucky . 8.20 kate ca n't finish her meal , despite lee trying to get her to . spencer sips his glass of water , and is protective of his microphone after jade puts her arm around him . 8.22 spencer jokes that sandy could be ' wife material ' , then wonders why he has to repeat every one of his jokes , thus ruining the effect . he tells the housemates how long it took him to remove his tattoos . 8.23 jonny accepts the offer of a cigarette from spencer , but not one of his . he also wishes that he could eat chocolate pudding and custard as an ideal dessert ; pj would much rather have treacle pudding . spencer questions how much their shopping budget'll be this and subsequent weeks . 8.24 jade tells the housemates that she loves danny , her boyfriend , as lee is called over by adele to check on his apple pie , which is nearly ready . 8.25 sandy and lynne are sitting by the pool ; lynne reckons that she 's calmed down a lot in the time she 's been in the house . meanwhile , alex waits to go into the diary room . 8.26 jonny asks if anyone has got the tea towel , as spencer , jade , kate and alison discuss what they should do with the chicken which is unwell ; spencer says that they should eat it , but jonny is averse to the idea , saying that he could n't kill it . adele reveals that it 'll taste rather hollow as well . 8.31 jade and adele do the washing up , as spencer and lee roam about in the kitchen . sandy and lynne have been joined outside by alex ; sandy reveals how he 'll progress with his life in a steady fashion after leaving the big brother house . they also consider how lucky they 've been to have been chosen to ' enjoy ' the bb experience , with alex pointing out that many have had work and home commitments meaning they 've been unable to enter . 8.33 lynne notices that big brother has provided the housemates with a steep learning curve , as alex goes back to his travelling days and how much they 've changed him as a person . alison has joined the housemates outside ; they compare the areas where they come from , as lynne suggests that they go to see adele 's appearance in a bodybuilding ' show ' in birmingham later in the year . 8.35 lynne observes that alex mutters ' you know ' after every sentence ; he maintains that he does n't realise he says it , as he 's not speaking spontaneously . 8.36 in the kitchen , adele does the washing up , and lee the drying up . 8.37 lynne tells the housemates in the garden that she 's felt left out at times as she feels that she 's not particularly bonding with anyone to a large degree . she also says that that 's made her feel like ' i can not handle this ' , but alison says that she feels like that too . 8.38 davina mccall 's voice comes over the tannoy , to tell the housemates to gather on the sofa . they all go hyper , effectively . 8.39 she informs them that the public have voted for two housemates to be put to the rest of them for eviction , and they have to get one out tonight . alison observes that ' that is tough , man ' . davina switches off , as pj clarifies how many are going out . 8.40 the housemates mull over the big news they 've just heard ; kate wishes them all good luck , as pj tells that he does n't want to go and jade says ' i 'm scared ' . adele checks that she 's alright , and wonders why they did n't do it before dinner . 8.41 jonny comes to terms with the fact that one of the housemates would 've only stayed in the bb house for a week , and how much their family will be down , as alison again clarifies that only one housemate is going tonight . sandy tries to settle jade , as she begins to feel a little sick . 8.43 spencer asks how long the public have been voting on the housemates for , as jonny mistakenly thinks that the public have already been told which two are up for nomination . 8.46 davina tells jade and lynne that they are up for eviction , and they go to the boys bedroom . the discussion around the sofa as to who to evict continues ; they have three minutes , and think before they have to put their hands up to decide who to evict . 8.47 lynne tries to calm jade down by telling her that she 'll go , rather than jade . 8.48 pj chooses lynne , adele chooses lynne , so does alex , and spencer , and jonny , and kate , as big brother reminds them that they have 30 seconds . 8.49 alison chooses lynne , and feels guilty for voting her out . bb tells the housemates that their time is up ; kate goes to the diary room , and evicts lynne . 8.50 the two nominees cuddle each other in the bedroom , as kate tells the housemates how the public have been voting . davina breaks the news to lynne that she will be evicted ; she cuddles jade , who is in floods of tears . 8.51 some of the other housemates go to the bedroom to console the two girls , as sandy ( who is in the lounge ) reflects on how exciting the first eviction has been ; kate 's says that it 's nerve - racking too . 8.52 lynne tells the housemates that it 'd be ' so shit ' to be the first to be voted out , but appears to be taking it in her stride . some of the other housemates think that the thought it was her crying . 8.53 lynne goes to the bedroom to pack ; kate 's there , and lynne wonders to her if it was her strop the other night that saw her go . sandy goes into the room to try and say something of comfort , and hopes that she gets a decent job when she gets out . 8.55 jonny consoles a tearful jade , as the guys around the sofa consider the manner of the eviction they 've just undertaken . even spencer looks a tad emotional . 8.56 kate comments on each of lynne 's clothes that she packs away ; even though lynne looks settled on the outside , you get the sense that she is really seething about it and is trying to hide that as best she can . kate tells lynne that she had an inkling a surprise eviction would happen . email print bookmark digg ds : bb is brought to you by digital spy , the uk 's number one digital media and entertainment news website ! showbiz news beatles stars attend fab four musical lindsay lohan planning secret party chris martin loses � 10k world cup bet david hasselhoff in hospital after accident paul o'grady admitted to hospital dmx put behind bars by judge tv news stephen fry to star in new itv drama itv greenlights celebrity genealogy series bravo picks up ' the unit ' , ' blade : the series ' soaps news ' emmerdale ' star speaks about peculiar fans leslie grantham to pen autobiography two new characters head for ' hollyoaks ' music news fall out boy hit back at flowers timberlake to debut material in london robbie to record with take that ? movies news marilyn manson to star in new film jesse eisenberg joins gere , howard writers make ' frenemies ' at paramount_nnp _ _ uk \ about us \ wateraid in the news \ the big clean up the big clean up india up to 150,000 indians die from water - related diseases every year luke harding reports on the struggle to make water work . for most people in britain , going to the toilet is a solitary experience . but for the residents of bells colony , a slum in southern india , it is a daily battle . the main enemy is the pig . the colony has no latrines , and so every morning the slum - dwellers troop off into the dense green thorn bushes to relieve themselves . this is not a pleasant experience . the pigs flourish amid the excrement , and have been known to attack small children . then there are the snakes . " there are lots of them lurking in the bushes . you have to make sure they do n't bite you , " one slum - dweller , mrs valli , explained . finally , there is the problem of floods . during the rainy season even getting to the thorn bushes is tricky . " we have to wade through waist - high water . there are holes in the ground . one old woman recently fell in . fortunately people go to the bushes in groups . we managed to pull her out , " she says . the problems of bells colony - an illegal urban slum next to the railway line in the pleasant temple town of tiruchirapalli - are by no means unique . across india , some 690 million people face a similar daily battle . they do not have access to proper sanitation . instead , they are forced to improvise : defecating in fields , thorn bushes , and sometimes along the tracks of india 's vast railway network - an arrangement that led the writer paul theroux in the great railway bazaar to coin the phrase " the turd world " . and yet open defecation is no joke . under india 's ancient caste system , the so - called " untouchables " have traditionally been responsible for disposing of night soil . this barbaric practice , known as " manual scavenging " , was made illegal in most indian states three years ago . and yet it persists . in some urban and rural areas , dalit ( " untouchable " ) villagers - fearful of retribution from higher caste landowners - continue to dispose of human waste . the residents of bells colony , who migrated there several decades ago and live in neat mud houses thatched with coconut leaves , are aware of the dangers of poor sanitation . " we want to change our lifestyle . we just need help , " valli adds . in other respects , the community exudes self - respect . the women recently formed their own self - help committee . every morning , they decorate their porches with kolam , an auspicious geometric pattern made from white powder . their alleyways are fastidiously clean . and like many women in south india , they wear fresh jasmine flowers in their hair . they have only one complaint : " we have no facilities , " mrs vijay lakshmi says . the lack of proper sanitation means that the slum - dwellers are often ill . they suffer from diarrhoea , dysentery , malaria , typhoid and brain fever . in the evenings , a dark crescent of mosquitoes hovers above the undergrowth kingdom of the pigs . five slum - dwellers recently contracted elephantiasis , a vicious disease spread by mosquito ( the medical name is lymphatic filariasis ) where the patient 's limbs and testicles swell up . when we turned up to inspect the slum , with its somnolent buffaloes and brightly decorated hindu temple , one child , suffering from diarrhoea , had just died . across india it is the same grim story . some 150,000 people perish every year from water - related diseases . the overwhelming majority are children aged three or under . this bleak statistic is hardly surprising when you consider that in urban areas of india only about 40 % of the population has access to proper latrines . in slums such as bells colony the figure drops to just 15 % . the answer to the slum - dwellers ' problems can be found on the other side of tiruchirapalli , next to a large banana warehouse where dozens of men swarm under a humid sky over bundles of green fruit . and it costs a mere � 600 to build . the british charity wateraid has come up with an ingenious solution to the hygiene problems in developing world slums - a community toilet . two years ago , the slum - dwellers of kalmandhai knocked down their old municipal latrine , which had fallen into disuse . the locals had reverted to their bad old ways : defecating not in , but around , the broken - down toilets . with a grant from wateraid , they built two new yellow - painted latrine blocks for men and women . they also constructed a special communal toilet for children - india 's first . most crucially , the local women who had previously had to disappear into the bushes before sunrise or after sunset managed the latrine themselves . they charged customers 50 paise ( less than 1p ) to use the facilities . they kept the blocks scrupulously clean . they provided soap . soon , about 1,000 slum - dwellers a day started visiting the new latrine , and the women found they were making a modest profit . " our aim is sanitation for all . if we get that , we will be happy , " the toilet committee 's manager , mrs ac ilangium , explains . round the back , they excavated several tonnes of excrement and planted a herb garden , full of flowering gourds . they opened up a shower block as well , charging the labourers working next door three rupees to have a shower . once the block was up and running , the women started experimenting with other entrepreneurial schemes . they bought some red worms from the neighbouring state of kerala and began making their own compost . they lent money to women from a neighbouring slum so that they could build another revenue - generating latrine block . and they employed a night watchman to stop drunks from clambering over the wall . last month , the women 's endeavours earned them a mention in indian newspapers when kalmandhai became the country 's first " 100 % sanitised slum " . the locals had stopped defecating in the open , for india nothing short of a miracle . other habits changed too . " in the past it was the job of lower castes to collect the night soil . but the ladies who run this latrine come from lots of different castes . everybody does it , " mrs ilangium , a formidable matriarch in a canary yellow sari , explains , sitting next to the toilet 's entrance where the daily tallies of customers are written in a ledger . even with unlimited resources , the problems of sanitation in india are not going to be solved quickly . it would take a generation . but wateraid , which has been working in india since the late 80s , is good at establishing virtuous models , run by local communities , where there is the added incentive of making a bit of money . the results from kalmandhai , meanwhile , have been dramatic . during the past two years the number of cases of diarrhoea among children has fallen from 73 % to 10 % . among adults , the figure has gone down from 20 % to 10 % . families who used to spend one - third of their � 30 monthly income on medicines suddenly found that they were better off . " i used to go to the toilet in the ditches , " martin , a 12-year - old boy from the slum , explains . " now i use the children 's latrine . i like the animals painted on the wall . i have only ever seen a lion in the circus . " but the enormity of the problem facing india - a vast country in the grip of rapid and chaotic urbanisation - is hard to exaggerate . a few miles away on the banks of the sluggish cauvery river , the inhabitants of kosameda slum have no access to proper sanitation . instead , they defecate on the river 's rubbish - strewn upper terraces . a few feet away , down in the bathing ghat , women wash their clothes in the same water . in the far distance , beyond the shimmering dragonflies , local youths splash in the river against a serene backdrop of palm trees . the setting is idyllic - but the reality is squalid . " there are scarcely any fish left in the river now because of the pollution , " one woman , vasantha , complains . " we did catch two crocodiles two weeks ago , though . we gave them to the police . " and the problems in india go beyond the mere provision of proper sanitation . the issue of water has become intensely political in a country of a billion - plus people . a historic dispute between the state of tamil nadu , where tiruchirapalli is situated , and neighbouring karnataka erupted bitterly a few months ago . tamil nadu 's chief minister jayalalithaa , accused her opposite number , s m krishna , of deliberately withholding water from the cauvery river , which flows through both states . krishna refused her request for more water , and said his farmers needed it . the row has provoked numerous demonstrations in both regions , a ban by tamil cable television operators of all channels from karnataka , and a nine - hour hunger strike by a tamil film star , rajnikath . one karnataka farmer even committed suicide . india 's central government has grudgingly tried to broker peace between both sides . very little water , meanwhile , is reaching tamil nadu . the cauvery at tiruchirapalli is little more than a looping trickle between gleaming mountainous sand banks . this water war follows several disastrous monsoons in india - the probable result , campaigners argue , of global warming . either way , the worsening drought in india makes life even more difficult for the country 's poor , some 170 million of whom do n't have access to safe water . wateraid now hopes to extend its operations from the southern states of tamil nadu , andhra pradesh , maharashtra , orissa and karnataka to northern india , where the problems are - if anything - even more acute . it works with more than 70 partner organisations , including , in tiruchirapalli , the impressive indian charity gramalaya , which operates in 25 urban slums . back in bells colony , the slum - dwellers are waiting for change . the pigs are still king . " we are trying to improve our slum scenario , " mrs valli says . " we just hope someone will help us . "_'' _ _ mossdale caverns- kneewrecker the introduction saturday , 28 january 2006 mossdale caverns - kneewrecker with the weather set to be fine all day and after a sleepless night and having checked the forecast three times that morning � there should n't be any rain � . off to the dales to meet mr c. after a rather late start as more neoprene had to be purchased for the forthcoming trip . the plan was to go to the end of tunnel caves and look for the voice connection with minicow passage and then possibly head up the dull north and far north . firstly although there are signs of the total devastation from flooding that can occur in mossdale all over the front of the scar , no point that we visited was safe from the effects of flooding . however the cave itself is far less oppressive than the scar gives the impression of it being . the rock is mostly very polished and clean . a series of involved crawls and short climbs between boulders lead to fossil chamber then down further boulders and crawling leads to the assembly hall . there were lots of routes through these early sections of the cave and the telephone cable helps a great deal . the assembly hall is a grand chamber where various routes lead off . the duo followed the passage at the base of the chamber to a low wide bedding with a sand and cobble floor aptly named � blackpool sands � . here holiday makers enjoying the views from their deck chairs , give you a warm smile and cheery � hello � as you pass through . there is a large increase of the water volume as a junction is met that carries in the main flow from broad street . by this time sam had lost feeling in his feet . then after a short distance the passage takes on a darker form with the only pleasantness being the light white fluffy foam of the recently sumped passage . this indicates the start of the drown or glories . this first section is wading through waist or chest deep water in a wide passage , where the draft indicates the way out on the return . the 1st drown or glory was glorious . the 2nd drown or glory was met shortly afterwards with a large pointy boulder pointing back into the passage you have just come from ( very useful on the return ) . this was followed by the swim . apparently it was once a swim but is now a short section of chest deep wading . the duo climbed out on to the boulders at the end of the swim for a moment before continuing on to the climb up into boulder hall . this is a large fine chamber with the way on being indicated by the gurgling and bubbling of the streamway lower down between the boulders . then follows confusion passage where the slow nature of the streamway and lots of interconnecting routes between the massive fallen roof blocks can make route finding difficult but by keeping left on the way in , a dry passage between blocks can be followed although the route out needs to be noted or a wet route has to be followed . confusion passage leads into broadway , a handsome stream passage of real walking height . this grand passage passes under a large aven before arriving at cigarette junction . the water flows to the left but we continued straight ahead to easy junction and then followed right passage to wiggle junction in straightway . at the far end of straightway is the great aven an impressive aven soaring out of sight . back along the passage a short distance is a route into rough chamber . leading off rough chamber is rough crawl which gives the first impression of the long crawls to come ! the small passage contains a very fast flowing stream that is intimidating . the stream leads to kneewrecker junction . this junction is where the marathon series begins . this is where mr c. raised concerns about the water levels as normally there is a 3 - 4 inch rise in water levels needed for water to flow down the marathon series but today was little different with 3 inch of water flowing straight into the marathon series . having just experienced the � sporting � nature of rough crawl a brief discussion ensued about whether to continue or not . it went something like : sam - � shit i ca n't feel my
