" . explanatory note ( this note is not part of the regulations ) these regulations are made under section 2 of the pollution prevention and control act 1999 ( 1999 c. 24 ) . they implement in england and wales the provisions of european council directive 1999/13/ec on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations ( the directive ) . the directive requires all installations carrying out activities listed in annex i of the directive above the thresholds in annex iia of the directive to comply with certain emission limit values ( sed installations ) . the majority of sed installations are already regulated under either the pollution prevention and control regulations 2000 ( s.i. 2000/1973 ) ( the 2000 regulations ) or part i of the environmental protection act 1990 ( 1990 c. 43 ) ( the 1990 act ) . these regulations use the existing pollution control regime set out under the 2000 regulations to deliver the requirements of the directive . as a result , these regulations adjust the transitional provisions under the 2000 regulations to align them with the requirements of the directive . regulations 3 to 7 deal with transitional amendments to incorporate the requirements of the directive into the existing pollution control regime under the 2000 regulations . regulation 3 deals with applications for variations of conditions of existing permits or authorisations granted under the 2000 regulations or the 1990 act for installations which contain new or existing sed installations with the purpose of incorporating the directive requirements into the permit or authorisation . regulation 4 sets out transitional provisions dealing with extensions of existing permits under the 2000 regulations covering part of an sed installation with the purpose of extending the scope of the permit to incorporate the whole of the sed installation . regulation 5 enables the operator to make supplementary applications modifying applications made under regulation 10 of the 2000 regulations in the situations specified in paragraphs ( 1)(a ) to ( c ) of regulation 5 . regulation 6 sets out the duties of operators wishing to operate an sed installation in accordance with the requirements of a reduction scheme as defined in regulation 2 of the 2000 regulations as amended by these regulations . regulation 7 specifies the duration of the transitional arrangements set out in regulations 3 to 6 to these regulations . regulation 8 makes amendments to the 2000 regulations to incorporate the requirements of the directive . regulation 8(6 ) inserts a new regulation 12a into the 2000 regulations requiring permits authorising the operation of an sed installation to include such conditions as the regulator considers necessary to give effect to the provisions of the solvent emissions directive . regulation 8(9 ) and schedule 1 to these regulations add a new section 7 to schedule 1 to the 2000 regulations . the new section 7 provides for activities listed in the table when operated above solvent consumption thresholds for that activity to be part b activities . regulation 8(10 ) amends the transitional arrangements in schedule 3 to the 2000 regulations and inserts new parts 3 and 4 to that schedule as set out in schedule 2 to these regulations . these regulations extend to england and wales . a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared and copies can be obtained from aeq division , department for environment , food and

statutory instruments | scottish statutory instruments | statutory rules of northern ireland | her majesty 's stationery office_nnp _ _ many of thomas hirschhorn 's art projects have taken place outside the conventional gallery space , and have usually involved the local community . for example , during documenta 11 ( 2002 ) he built a temporary monument to georges bataille , the radical french intellectual , which functioned as a library , a snack bar and a tv studio . constructed by people from the neighbourhood , who were paid by the artist and worked under his direction , it aimed to connect bataille 's writings to hirschhorn 's approach to art . in may this year , the artist set up a satellite museum � the mus � e pr � caire albinet � in the paris suburbs . run by local residents and showing work borrowed from the centre georges pompidou , it was more than an exercise in curating . � the mus � e pr � caire is a work of art , and not a socio - cultural project , � said hirschhorn . � i am an artist , i am not a social worker . � alfred pacquement , director of the mus � e national d'art moderne , centre pompidou , reflects here on how the project shifted attitudes to the display and experience of art . building the mus � e pr � caire albinet , aubervilliers , 2004 courtesy mus � e pr � caire albinet . photograph : emilie lamy in spring 2003 , thomas hirschhorn wrote to me about his desire to build a precarious museum in collaboration with the laboratoires d'aubervilliers , a public cultural organisation based in the paris suburb where he lives and works . he explained that the viability of his project hinged upon the availability of certain loans from the pompidou collection . yet , as this was an artistic proposition and not an institutional exhibition , his request could not be treated as a conventional loan . like any art historian or essayist , hirschhorn asserted his own criterion � artists who he believed wanted to change the world through their work � in order to select the eight artists that made up the mus � e pr � caire 's exhibition programme : marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kasimir malevich , andy warhol , salvador dal � , le corbusier , joseph beuys and fernand l � ger . it was crucial , in his view , to show major works such as duchamp 's bicycle wheel , or important paintings by mondrian and dal � � no second - rate pieces . it was an unusual proposal , as was the context in which the works were to be shown . our first reaction was rather sceptical : can we , and should we , follow this request ? however , we had a great deal of con.dence in hirschhorn because of his strong personal engagement in similar projects in the past , so we decided to enlarge the scope of our collaboration in order to find a way to make these loans possible . bruno racine , our president at centre georges pompidou , was keen to work with the local community to develop the project , and the idea emerged that the centre pompidou could participate with thomas and the laboratoires in organising an intensive , practical jobtraining programme for the young people who would be involved in running it . after doing several short internships � such as working on the installation of the biennale de lyon � a group of twelve young people had a two - month full immersion in the different departments of the centre pompidou , including security , art handling , framing , installing and public information and education . since they were well prepared before the opening , there was a strong sense that this mus � e pr � caire belonged to them . the hands - on involvement of the residents of aubervilliers was always at the heart of the plan , so we approached the training programme as we would any other professional internship . we made no special exceptions because of the size or the � precariousness � of their future museum . the result was a quite extraordinary atmosphere . on the one hand there was this incredibly relaxed environment . under usual circumstances , people tend to act differently in a museum � such as lowering their voices as they walk around the space . yet in aubervilliers , the residents did not change their everyday behaviour . there was music playing . there were kids hanging out in the mus � e pr � caire 's caf � , playing and running around in front of the exhibition space . in stark contrast though , there was an air of utter dedication when it came to the young people employed by the museum . it was obvious that they took their jobs extremely seriously . one could sense that they felt the responsibility and trust con.ded in them by the pompidou in lending them these artworks . centre pompidou 's ambition is continually to develop new audiences and to take modern art and culture to a wider public . contemporary art can not always compete with more popular forms of mass culture , such as cinema or pop music , and we are not always successful in reaching all sectors of the public . yet , as this particular project was initiated by an artist who took on the task of involving people who would not usually come to us , the mus � e pr � caire provided a

( nb if soil tends to be unstable excavate to 20 cm deep and fill with aggregate 10 cm deep , alternatively make a larger deeper ring beam ) fill the excavation with a concrete mix of 4:2:1 ( aggregate : sand : cement ) and cover with damp grass / leaves and leave for two days . start building the brickwork , with a plinth outer size of approximately 0.8 m , on top of the concrete ring using a mortar mix of 5:1 ( sand : cement ) to a height of 0.55 m as shown in figure 1 . leave a gap in the top course of bricks for the outlet pipe . figure 1 dimensions for the plinth foundation fill the centre of the plinth with rubble / aggregate , compacting it well to prevent later settling . figure 1a brickwork plinth cut off a length of 3/4 � gi pipe and fit on a 3/4 � elbow at one end and a 3/4 � to 1/2 � reducer and a 1/2 � tap at the other . local plumbers can thread the gi pipes , alternatively a low cost method of threading 3/4 � pvc pipe is explained in appendix 1 . cut off a piece of pipe 25 mm long pipe that has been threaded at one end and fit this to the elbow . this will give the jar a settling zone , but it can also be removed for washouts . dig out a channel in the rubble and place the pipe in so that the tap and the elbow are vertical . n.b. make sure the top of the elbow is 3 cm above the level of the rubble . apply a 1 cm layer of mortar to the top of the rubble and flush with the edges of the plinth , apply a layer of damp material and cover with plastic sheet , leave this to cure . prepare a disc of mortar 0.6 m diameter by 1 cm deep on to the plinth base . cut out a ring of chicken mesh to a diameter of 0.75 m and turn up the edges 0.1 m , so that it leaves a base diameter for the jar of 0.55 m . while the disc of mortar is still damp lay the chicken mesh on to the top of this and then apply another layer 1 cm deep to the mesh this should be level with the top of the elbow . figure 2 the filled polypropylene sack mould cut out and sew up a polypropylene or hessian sack to the dimensions shown in appendix 2 . fill the sack mould with sawdust ( rice husk , coffee husks , sand or any other similar available material ) and compact it as it is being filled . when full tie it up at the top and pat the sides to produce an even symmetrical shape then place this on the prepared base of ferro - cement as shown in figure 2 . the capacity of the jar can be determined by filling the sack with buckets of known volume , simply count the number of buckets to until 500 litres is achieved . place a medium sized basin centrally on top of the mould with a short length of pvc pipe for the overflow . apply the first coat of mortar of 3:1 mix with a waterproof additive ( quantity as per manufacturers instructions ) to a thickness of 1 cm as shown if figure 3 , ( the thickness may vary as the irregularities of the mould shape is compensated for ) figure 3 overflow , filter basin and first coat application when the first coat has been applied cover with a damp cloth and a plastic sheet , leave for 24 hours , making sure the cloth is kept damp . wrap around the jar a suitable length of chicken mesh to cover the whole area up to the filter basin pull the mesh tight and fix with short lengths of wire to secure in place as shown in figure 4 . figure 4 applying the mesh on top of first coat apply the second coat of mortar ( make this layer smooth by rubbing over with a small wooden hand float ) also apply mortar around the tap outlet to secure it to the base and jar side as shown in figure 5 . cover the shell again with a damp cloth and a plastic sheet , leave for 48 hours . when the shell is firm carefully remove the filter basin and untie the mould bag , and carefully take out the contents . fill the bottom of the jar with enough water to come up to the level of the outlet pipe and replace the damp cloth with the plastic sheet and leave for 7 days to cure . make a series of about twenty holes in the bottom of the basin using a hot nail or a drill ( � 6 mm ) for the rain to enter the jar . fill the basin with aggregate ( about 20 mm ) to about one third full . figure 5 detail of the outlet fixing cut out a section of clean cloth that will cover the basin and have sufficient to overhang down the sides , then tie around the sides of the basin with string or rubber inner tube strip to hold the cloth in place . lower the basin on to the top of the jar . fix the appropriate gutter to the roof and place the downpipe directly on to the cloth . cut out a small piece of mosquito mesh and fit this on to the end of the overflow pipe with string / twine etc . 9 . care of the jar on completion once the jar is finished and has cured for 7 days , fill with 125 mm ( 5 � ) of water each day so that the structure is gradually loaded rather than all at once . it may be noticed that the jar will leak slightly somewhere around the sides , it is best if this is left for at least a week , as quite often the jar will eventually seal itself if the hole is small ( based on masons personal experience in uganda ) . however , if it shows no sign of sealing or the hole is quite visible , empty the jar and make the repair with a nil mix ( i.e. purely a cement and water mix ) from the inside of the jar . it is important that there are no gaps around the filter and cover , or around the filter where light can enter as this will not only encourage the growth of algae but may be an entry point for mosquitoes both of which should be avoided . the water may have a cement taste at first so either rinse out well several times or use the jar for washing rather than cooking for the first few times . return to index page_nn _ _ your feedback on consumer direct your comments and complaints how to send your feedback complaints about traders and other consumer enquiries your comments and complaints we are committed to providing a high quality , accessible and responsive service to consumers . one of the ways in which we can continue to improve our service to you and to other consumers is by listening and responding to your comments and complaints . your comments we are always pleased to receive your comments about our work . it is useful for us to know when we have done a good job , as well as when things have gone less well . this helps us maintain and enhance our service to all our customers . your complaints we hope you will be fully satisfied with the service you receive from consumer direct , but if you have a complaint about our service we want to hear from you . we will take your complaint seriously , and will address it and respond to it as quickly as possible . top how to send your feedback you can send us your comments or complaints on our service , which we will deal with confidentially , by telephone , online or in writing . by telephone to telephone us with your comments or complaints , please call 08454 04 05 06 . online to provide feedback on any part of the consumer direct service , see feedback online . in writing if you wish to write to us with your comments or complaints about the consumer direct service , write to : consumer direct concorde house 10 -

dimensional point - like objects , but as one - dimensional strings vibrating in different ways . string theory is appealing because gravity emerges naturally from the mathematics . the first experimental tests of the predictions of string theory may be possible when the large hadron collider is completed at cern ._. _ _ see the landmarks that make london famous , from royal palaces to big ben . items 1 to 10 of 53 -

page : 1_cd _ _ motivational games to boost morale and retention in call centres as more and more call centre executives move to greener pastures , the attrition crisis is gaining improportionate shape . " you can smell lack of self - esteem when you walk through the door , " said kirk weisler , a public speaker and authority on team building and creating positive corporate cultures . it all boils down to one thing -- motivation , or rather , the lack of it . what 's required is a mix of company policy with motivational tactics , along with an active participation by the management , and a conscious effort to reward the employees , not only monetarily , but also with appreciation and recognition . sounds difficult ? games at southwest airlines rob lalim , one of the directors in southwest airlines , says , " we use caution not to create a kindergarten - type environment to motivate employees . our motivation efforts are geared towards treating employees like adults . we host fun - event days and internal contests to motivate " . the attrition rate in the telemarketing sector is currently around 25 per cent , and expected to rise in the next 18 to 24 months to 35 - 40 per cent . ( source : nasscom ) southwest airlines sets an example in this respect . their call centres are well known for a fun working culture . they always end the weekend in style ; friday is always a " fun day " . this creates an interest among executives and they look forward to coming to the office , and begin their shift . consequently , more and more call centres have started organizing events on a regular basis that encourage the employees to bond with one another . various contests such as , scavenger hunt , halloween howl , talent show , and mr. and ms. customer service contest are also organised for recognising the latent talents of the employees . the recognition they get further improves their morale . a simple act of showing appreciation , such as a pat on the back , makes a lot of difference , but is pass � . shauna verges , alias ishika ( 20 ) a call centre executive with daksh said , " the best boss i ever had came into my office at the start of every day and gave me a rousing welcome . he knew that if i felt good about what i was doing , my agents would feel good about what they were doing . he recognized that if he got me off to a rousing start , i would project that enthusiasm to my agents " . but recognition practices are not enough to make agents stick at a job for long . weisler puts the onus of the problem on management who do n't realise the importance of motivating their executives . he grimly observes , " who with good esteem would like to work in this type of environment ? many people who work in call centres are doing something until they can find the job they really want . " according to weisler , the all - important link that the management ignored so far was that motivated and happy staff would yield better performance , and result in increased profits for the company . though the level of motivation is very much correlated to the morale of the executives , but they are not the same . in absence of either of these , the performance of the call executives suffers . as kimberly croft , president of interweave , a tampa , fl . , based performance management consultancy for call centres , recounts her experience , " i 've been in call centres where supervisors have pulled agents out of bathrooms -- yelling at them because they were n't meeting performance goals " . that is why , while starting a motivational tactic it is elementary to build up the morale of the team . otherwise , as croft says , " contests can whip agents into a frenzy for today . then tomorrow -- when there is no game -- people are crumbling . that kind of emotional yo - yo just kills motivation " . thus , the requirement of the fun culture to motivate the agents . it can be a contest , a game , or any other event that has an element of fun . have a get - together of the agents , over a short coffee break , and ask them to put forth fun ideas to be incorporated at the centre . reward the executives with the ' monopoly ' money . fix some goodies that can be bought with that money . the rewards should be based on day - to - day performance of the agents . gauge the team spirit . hide some prizes , anywhere on the floor , and then give out clues to the team to locate the hidden object . you may give out the clues on the basis of the day - to - day performance , or hold a separate contest and give the clues to the winners . bob nelson , director of nelson motivation inc. , stressed that applying 5-i approach ( i.e. , interesting work , information , involvement , independence , and increased visibility ) as the fundamentals in a human - sensitive organization that ensures higher motivation levels among its executives . the result shows in the performance of the employees , as in the case of yash singhal ( 25 ) , a call centre executive with wipro spectramind . in his words , " i am a lot more self - confident than i used to be in my initial days . these interactive programs and fun sessions are really very helpful . i have started believing in myself again , and i am ready to take on any challenge " . but there 's a long way to go ! communication plays a major role in enhancing the motivation . and all the management experts , and the strategists unanimously agree on the importance of communication . the management has to communicate with the executives on a regular basis , regarding company policies , future plans , and the incentive plans . it is also needed that the agents be constantly updated about their performance . thus , the actual role of management lies not only in improving the performance of the employees , but also ensuring a quality life for them . ingeniously , if the employees feel cared for , the attrition issue gets resolved on its own , because no one wants to leave a good company . to initiate a fun and motivational approach towards work , think creatively !_. _ _ help disclaimer the rural community gateway website ( � the website � ) is a resource on the internet for rural communities . the

are over 27,000 new cases of lung cancer in the united kingdom each year . protein kinases are frequently mutated in human cancer and inhibitors of mutant protein kinases have proven to be effective anticancer drugs . the cancer genome project has screened the complete coding sequence of all 518 protein kinase genes in 33 lung cancers . this study , published in cancer research , is the largest survey reported to date of somatic mutations in lung cancer . the cancer genome project at the wellcome trust sanger institute was established in 2000 . its goal is to identify mutations that occur in cancer cells to enable the development of new diagnostics and new treatments and advance our understanding of the biology of cancer . the wellcome trust sanger institute cancer genome project and their collaborators have published the latest results of their survey of genes that might be implicated in cancer . the report is published in cancer research on thursday 1st september 2005 and is also available through cosmic . the gene set chosen was a class called protein kinases , key controllers of cell growth and death . members of this family have been shown to be important in cancer . however , the whole set has never been sequenced in a single set of lung tumours . the study generated over 40 million bases of dna sequence ( 1.3 million for each sample ) . this work identified 188 somatic mutations in 141 protein kinase genes . there was considerable variation in the number of mutations found in each tumour . the results indicate that several mutated protein kinases may be contributing to lung cancer development , but that mutations in each one are infrequent . larger studies are warranted to further explore these initial findings . cancer is a complex set of diseases that will affect 1 in 3 people . this work in the cgp is but one part of a global effort to further understanding of cancer and move towards better diagnosis and treatment . 31st aug 2005 sanger

from a systematic characterisation of the genetics and genomics of over 600 cancer cell lines including the nci-60 . for decades , human immortal cancer cell lines have constituted an accessible , easily usable set of biological models with which to investigate cancer biology and to explore the potential efficacy of anticancer drugs . nevertheless , cancer cell lines have been criticised because they may represent a highly selected subgroup of the cancer classes from which they have been derived and have acquired additional genetic abnormalities in vitro . prior knowledge of the genetic abnormalities in cancer cell lines may , however , allow more informed choice of cell lines in biological experiments and drug testing and better interpretation of results . the aim of these studies , therefore , is to systematically provide this information and hence to improve the utility of cancer cell lines for the cancer research community . we have assembled a large series of cancer cell lines from major publicly accessible repositories around the world . from this series we have currently selected a series of more than 600 lines for detailed analysis . this series has been designed to encompass a broad range of tumour types . it includes most cell lines that have been used extensively in cancer research , including the nci-60 set . the analyses that have been performed so far are ; sequencing of known cancer genes the coding exons and immediate flanking intron sequences of genes from the cancer gene census are being sequenced . these studies are ongoing and the current release includes braf ( 34 mutations ) , kras ( 79 mutations ) nras ( 46 mutations ) and tp53 ( 216 mutations ) . copy number analysis we have analysed the cancer cell lines for genome - wide loss of heterozygosity and copy number changes using affymetrix 10k snp dna microarrays . microsatellite instability the cancer cell lines have been assessed for microsatellite instability using the bat markers ( bat25 , bat26 , d5s346 , d2s123 and d17s250 ) . cell line ancestry the genotypes generated from the affymetrix 10k snp dna microarrays have been used to compare the genome - wide genotypes of all the lines with each other . this has identified lines with very similar genotypes suggesting that they originate from a common ancestor and are probably derivatives of each other . 31st may 2005 wormbase 143 released the wormbase group at the sanger institute has released the latest version of the wormbase database . click here for more information about the c. elegans genome project or look at our local wormbase pages ( with information about the latest wormpep release and local blast services ) 27th may 2005 zebrafish assembly zv5 in pre - ensembl the fifth zebrafish

alignments from different sources . please note that these preliminary databases do n't feature a gene build . subsequent annotations including the ensembl genebuild are ongoing and will be added as soon as they are completed . 23rd may 2005 protein kinases and breast cancer the cancer genome project has screened the complete coding sequence of all 518 protein kinase genes in 25 breast cancers . this study , published online in nature genetics , is the largest survey reported to date of somatic mutations in cancer . the cancer genome project at the wellcome trust sanger institute was established in 2000 . its goal is to identify mutations that occur in cancer cells to enable the development of new diagnostics and new treatments and advance our understanding of the biology of cancer . the wellcome trust sanger institute cancer genome project and their collaborators have published the latest results of their survey of genes that might be implicated in cancer . the report , published in nature genetics online on sunday 22 may 2005 , identifies a new � mutator signature ' and shows that there is no common mutation of a set of key genes in the 25 breast cancer samples examined . the gene set chosen was a class called protein kinases , key controllers of cell growth and death . members of this family have been shown to be important in cancer . however , the whole set has never been sequenced in a single set of tumours . the data , 1.3 million bases of dna sequence for each sample , is the most that has ever been obtained from a single tumour type . the study identified a novel mutation pattern that had never been seen before and gives new insight to the number and diversity of mutations in cancer . there was no indication that any of the protein kinase genes was frequently mutated in this set of breast cancer samples . cancer is a complex set of diseases and this one large study is only part of a global effort to unlock the genetic secrets of a disease that affects 270,000 people each year in the uk alone . 16th may 2005 ciona intestinalis " title="ensembl release of ciona intestinalis " / > ensembl release of ciona intestinalis the first

several different cities including newcastle , london , kyoto ( japan ) and most recently paris , have been vital in informing her understanding of the nature of the city and the possibilities of rendering space in two dimensions . she has made particular research into japanese momoyama period painting , studying the manner in which movement through time and space is integral to the construction of , and expressed by , the composition . this has led to images in which the depicted space is not restricted to a single point perspective . it allows her to explore an encompassing sense of space , to explore the relationship between an individual and the objects surrounding them at a particular moment : a moment when the spatial relationships seem suddenly dynamic and to manifest intersections of time and space . in many of the images , scaffolding , hoardings , bridges , railings and junctions are recurrent motifs . they are objects which dictate the pace and direction of movement through the city , by creating routes and linking one area with another . they seem to simultaneously create , and be expressive of , the experience of space within the city . the ' kingsland construction ' series is based on an area of london which is changing rapidly at the moment : buildings are demolished at lightning speed , new permanent structures equally swiftly constructed and in the interim a multitude of temporary passage ways and tunnels made of hoardings and scaffolding divert traffic around their sites . during this process , entirely new vistas are suddenly revealed and others blocked off , drastically altering an individual 's conception of space in that area . most recently she has made work using a map of paris as the starting point . within this series ( " carte " ) the aerial viewpoints , which were evident in the images based on london , have been exaggerated . the focus has also shifted from an immersion in the street itself , to a consideration of the city as a whole - through an exploration of the main entrances to , and exits from , the city , and of the routes which are carved through the city , by train lines , bridges , roads etc . however , the dynamism of urban space remains , as does the layering of forms , in order to create a structure capable of conveying the nature of movement through time and space within the city ._. _ _ advertise with us as a leading destination for freely available digital versions of important and hard - to - find texts and data which the historical research community find valuable ,

( 1996 ) the geomorphological characterisation of digital elevation models phd thesis , university of leicester , uk , http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~jwo/phd abstract techniques and issues are considered surrounding the characterisation of surface form represented by digital elevation models ( dems ) . a set of software tools suitable for use in a raster based geographical information system ( gis ) is developed . characterisation has three specific objectives , namely to identify spatial pattern , to identify scale dependency in form and to allow visualisation of results . an assessment is made of the characteristics of error in dems by identifying suitable quantitative measures and visualisation processes that may be enabled within a gis . these are evaluated by contour threading a fractal surface and comparing four different spatial interpolations of the contours . the most effective error characterisations are found to be those that identify high frequency spatial pattern . visualisation of spatiall arrangement of dem error is used to develop a deterministic error model based on local surface slope and aspect . dems are parameterised using first and second derivatives of quadratic surfaces fitted over a range of scales . this offers advantages over traditional methods based on a 3 by 3 local window , as geomorphometric form can be characterised at any scale . morphometric parameters are combined to give a feature classification that may also be applied over a range of scales . multi - scale measurements are combined to give a feature membership function that describes how properties change with scale . these functions are visualised using modal and entropy measures of variability . an additional method of visualising scale dependency is suggested that graphically represents statistical measures of spatial pattern over a variety of spatial lags . this is found to be most appropriate for detecting structural anisotropy in a surface . characterisation tools are evaluated by applying them to uncorrelated surfaces , fractal surfaces and ordnance survey dems of the lake district , peak district and dartmoor . chapter one : introduction surface characterisation - from gridded dems only , research objectives ;

vote for candidates of the alternative ! build the workers � opposition ! disaffection with representative democracy : the alternative is the future_nnp _ _ mr. shepherd : well , i got an answer that could have been written 10 , 12 , 14 or 20 years ago . no one in the chamber is trying to abuse the national security services . as i tried to suggest , the very words " national security " have a weighty presence . think of this . i quote a letter from a former under - secretary of state for social security published in the guardian on 24 september 1997 . he confirmed the role of mi5 in connection with his department 's work : currently , the security service is involved in an audit of security procedures in the dss as part of its publicly acknowledged role as principal adviser to government on protective security and practice . this involves the examination of the department 's internal management and systems controls . i knew that the minister would go heavily on arms , on the war that we fight with terrorists and so on , but there are many functions in the remit of the security services . in that instance , mi5 effectively carried out management consultancy for the dss , but the results of that work , which presumably was no different in substance to that which would otherwise have been done by an outside consultancy , would have been exempt merely because they were produced by mi5 staff rather than the staff of kpmg . there is a blanket response every time that one tries to talk about what should be accessible under the terms of a freedom of information act . we get the solemn and correct intoning of reliance on a service that virtually no one in the chamber knows anything about . i know almost nothing about the security services . over the years in which i have tried to advance some of the arguments to bring the security services in from the cold , if that is not a jeffrey archer title--[hon . members : " no . " ] no indeed . one of the arguments is that this is a question of confidence for the house . we respect those who protect us , but we know that because of its remit , which we have discussed on the floor of the house , the service has been concerned with all manner of things . 9 pm the service has a long history , which is relevant to the bill . the bill almost suggests that someone could say , " if i want to exclude a piece of information , i can ask the security services to pass it across my desk " . under the bill as it is now drafted , an umbrella of absolute exclusion would then be erected . i thought that , in presenting freedom of information proposals , the government were recognising that , although much was already open , we needed such measures as harm tests . whether the threshold should be higher or lower is not the point at issue . we are saying that some of the great organisations of state -- the police , the armed forces , the national health service and organisations whose members rescue people on the roads -- should be excluded because of the phrase " national security " . we know the background to some of the stories . the minister will have observed my assiduity in not going into certain horror stories with which i am acquainted , 5 apr 2000 : column 1062 whether or not they are true . i am thinking of greenham common , and incidents involving the campaign for nuclear disarmament . we learn that the home secretary himself , no less , was on a list that included the secretary of state for northern island . however , i make nothing of that . that was yesterday ; we now look forward to tomorrow . this is not an attempt to undermine any aspect of the proper and legitimate defences of this country , which are a responsibility of executive government , and a very solemn one . i recognise and respect that , but i am not happy about a blanket ruling . what if there is a rogue element ? under the bill as it stands , if the secretary of state for social security 's friend from the security services passes a piece of paper across the desk , and if it relates to something about which the secretary of state does not want to know , that will be subject to a total exclusion . this is what is really behind the measure . i understand why the minister responded as he did . he read a brief that has been read many times here -- but there were moments when i thought that , if my memory had been better , i could have joined him and we could have performed as a duo . the same thing often applies to our arguments about freedom of information , and our arguments about the security services , which i know will continue . in many instances the employees of the security services are brave and bonny people , but they should never be out of sight of those who are commissioned and paid for by the state , and are loyal citizens of that state -- indeed , fellow citizens . that is what this is about . it is not about any of the big things such as bombs and sensitivities about northern ireland ; it is about the mundane , common things that affect every department that serves this nation of ours . i beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment . amendment , by leave , withdrawn . clause 24 defence mr. david heath : i beg to move amendment no . 15 , in page 13 , line 13 , after " to , " , insert " substantially " . mr. deputy speaker ( mr. michael lord ) : with this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments : no . 16 , in page 13 , line 21 , after " to , " , insert " substantially " . no . 17 , in

substantially " . no . 22 , in page 14 , line 35 , after " to , " , insert " substantially " . 5 apr 2000 : column 1063 no . 39 , in clause 28 , page 15 , line 4 , at end insert-- ' and if its disclosure under this act would , or would be likely to , prejudice any of those purposes ' . no . 23 , in clause 29 , page 16 , line 10 , after " to , " , insert " substantially " . no . 24 , in page 17 , line 10 , after " to , " , insert " substantially " . no . 25 , in clause 31 , page 18 , line 4 , after " to , " , insert " substantially " . no . 26 , in page 18 , line 9 , after " to , " , insert " substantially " . mr. heath : amendment no . 15 stands in my name and in the names of an array of members of the progressive faction . all but one of the amendments deal with the same notion , while amendment no . 39 deals with a separate notion , which i intend to discuss separately . if i do so reasonably briefly , that does not mean that i am undermining the importance of the amendments ; it simply means that i believe that the house wants to reach a conclusion on the bill at some stage . moreover , many of the arguments were dealt with at length in committee . it is a shame that the hon . member for ryedale ( mr. greenway ) is not present , because he was very much involved in our debate in committee and expressed clear views . the amendment seeks to qualify the prejudice test by inserting the adverb " substantially " . that , we think , is a fairly important aspect of making legislation effective , and not over - prescriptive or over - restrictive . in committee , we had a long and rather fruitless debate -- which i am sure the minister will recall -- on whether the word " harm " was synonymous with the word " prejudice " and whether the words differ in connotation . ultimately , we had to accept that the minister prefers the word " prejudice " simply because he prefers it , and we left it at that . we should debate that point again today , but should consider whether there needs to be a slightly higher threshold . hon . members will recall that the white paper was very explicit on the issue , proposing a test of substantial harm . it was critical of the code for not providing a threshold of substantial harm . although i do not know whether prejudice is a higher test than harm , the white paper proposed that the bill should be set in specific and demanding terms . the background papers to the white paper , which were very instructive on the issue , noted that substantial harm would clearly be more stringent ( and so provide greater openness ) than the code of practice on access to government information ( which normally exempts on the basis of simple " harm " or " prejudice " ) and would be closer to the " real damage " test of pii . practical experience of applying a " real damage " test in litigation indicates that it results in a substantial reduction in the volume of material which would be withheld . therefore , from discussions both preceding and following publication of the white paper , we have had a clear indication that a test of real damage should be used in disclosing information . the home secretary was 5 apr 2000 : column 1064 clearly similarly minded . in his statement on the draft bill , he expressed his preference for the word " prejudice " and said that , in practice , the prejudice has to be real , actual or of " substance".-- [ official report , 24 may 1999 ; vol . 332 , c. 22 . ] that is the crucial point . the minister contends that that is the meaning of prejudice and that it needs no further qualification . he also contends that , even if prejudice does not mean that , that is how -- because of pepper v. hart , which the home secretary had in mind -- it would be interpreted . the difficulty with that construction is that , as pepper v. hart makes clear , a minister 's comments would be taken into account only if the provision were ambiguous or obscure or the literal meaning would lead " to an absurdity " . even then , the minister 's comments would be taken into account only if they addressed the issue . however , it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which the courts would test the ambiguity in the word " prejudice " . if they were to do so , would they take into account the home secretary 's gloss on the word ? i suspect that they would not . the bill contains nothing that equates with the home secretary 's test of real , actual or of " substance " . like other hon . members , i think that , if the bill is to do its job properly and we are to avoid exemptions that cover much wider classes of information than need to be covered , we need that type of threshold . amendment no . 39 would amend clause 28 , which provides a blanket exemption protecting all information on investigations by police and regulators , even if disclosure could not harm legal proceedings . the list of regulators is quite broad . it includes not only police , but -- as the minister advised us , for which we are grateful -- the health and safety executive , environmental health officers , trading standards officers , fire authorities , the drinking water inspectorate , the environment agency , the director general of water services , the maritime and coastguard agency , the civil aviation authority , the inland revenue , customs and excise , the crown prosecution service , the benefits agency , the department of trade and industry , the ministry of agriculture , fisheries and food , the housing corporation , the national criminal intelligence service and the serious fraud office . thus a wide range of bodies are covered . that extraordinary blanket exemption does not take into account all the factors that would justify revealing information . it does not apply the harm test which we might imagine would be inherent in any such provision . it simply says that all information held by those bodies in that context would be exempt . amendment no . 39 would allow the withholding of such information only if disclosure would prejudice the purpose for which it is held . that is not unreasonable . the reason for withholding information should be that its disclosure would disadvantage the investigating authority or the police in the execution of their duties . that is not a problem in other countries ' freedom of information legislation . there is a genuine concern about the circumstances in which material would be exempt . a local authority might refuse to release information on investigations into children 's homes or even to admit to there having been 5 apr 2000 : column 1065 an investigation . that is not a healthy situation . that is setting aside the effect on the police . the macpherson report , which has been given careful attention in the house , says explicitly that there should be no class exemption for the police . it argues that re - establishing public confidence in the police requires a vigorous pursuit of openness and accountability across police services . the report goes on to say that we consider it an important matter of principle that the police services should be open to the full provisions of a freedom of information act . we see no logical grounds for a class exemption for the police in any area . there could be no more explicit endorsement of my case . that view is shared by the law society , which has said that it fully supports the amendment . the argument that the amendment would prevent the police or regulatory authorities from doing their job effectively is untenable . even if clause 28 were changed much more radically than the amendment would change it , there would always be clause 29 , which clearly says : information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 28 is exempt information if its disclosure under this act would , or would be likely to , prejudice-- ( a ) the prevention or detection of crime , ( b ) the apprehension or prosecution of offenders , ( c ) the administration of justice and a list of other roles of regulatory authorities . this is a serious group of amendments . the minister must explain why he has chosen to reduce the threshold . amendment no . 39 is crucial . he must also explain why there should be a blanket exemption for that critical area of public service . i shall listen carefully to the minister . i suspect that the house will wish to give an opinion on both matters ._. _ _ listed below you will find the latest academy news and press releases . for information on current issues or

involving the coco pops monkey . special powers : an uncanny knack of catapulting himself 12 feet in the air whilst performing what can only be described as a ' quadro somersault . ' from a stationary pose . whilst being heard on battlecom proclaiming : " fuckin clays ! ! " favourite saying = " i'd ratther have a bowwl of co - co pops . " profile : wabbit was born in the early 70 's in a dingy back street underground laboratory . ( which cannot be named for legal reasons ) dna samples taken from the coco pops monkey were mixed with the cells of a one legged sheep farmer named reginald sidebottom from the sleepy lancashire town of blackburn . the results can only be described as mind blowing . at an early age wab was quickly beginning to show signs of abnormality . clearly not happy with the traditional baby food diet of ' farleys rusks ' and ' cow & gate baby milk ' it soon became apparent that the only sources of nutrients required for this ' entity ' could only be derived from a diet of bacon butties , bbq'd spare ribs and yes ..... a minimum of 3 bowls of coco pops per day . not forgetting the occasional helping of shreddies and shredded wheat . ( donkey 's bedding ) by the age of four wabbit was showing signs of what can only be described as amazing marksmanship . armed with an air rifle he could often be seen walking the moors of blackburn hunting wild haggis shouting " in de heeeeeeeeed ! " it is written in blackburn folklore that in one day alone ( now by the age of 15 ) the now older wiser , paunch wearing wabbit came back from the hilltops with 17 wild haggis ' , a one eared rabbit and a squirrel with mange . with an amazing act of kindness , he fed the town for a week and a statue was then erected in honour in the town centre . ( now sadly defaced with slogans such as ' sheep shagger ' ... ' woolly foreskin ' ...

statutory ) and a local commissioner to participate in either the london or york event . participants were requested to give their reactions to the direction the project was heading and to give feedback on the early drafts presented by the team . following the consensus events , the team considered the feedback and advice they had received from the more than 70 participants in the consensus events . this advice was incorporated into the next draft of the models of care document . 2 . inter - departmental government review the final draft of the models of care document was circulated within the department of health and by the department of health to a number of other government departments including the home office and the department for further education and employment to ensure that the guidance contained in models of care was not in conflict with the policies of , or other guidance issued by , various government departments . 3 . public consultation the final draft of models of care was released by ministers for public consultation in february 2002 with a period of three months allowed for this consultation . summary copies of models of care were posted to all drug treatment agency in england as well as to professional associations , membership organisations and academic institutions . the full report was made available to anyone who requested a copy and it was posted on the nta website for anyone to review and download . models of care was the subject of two workshops held at the nta national conference in manchester on the 10 and 11 april 2002 . more than 150 service users , commissioners , dat co - ordinators and staff from drug treatment services participated in these workshops . a number of other workshops were provided around england on demand , including one for the london drug and alcohol network . the public consultation came to an end on 31 may 2002 . more than 50 detailed responses were received and these comments have been taken into consideration in the final report ._. _ _ kruger fact file everything you need to know about krugerrands . one ounce of gold the south african chamber of mines had an inspired idea to help market south african gold . it was to issue a one ounce bullion coin , to be sold at a very low premium over the intrinsic gold value . back in 1967 krugerrands were first minted and issued in 1967 , and have been produced every year since . they have legal tender status in south africa , which allowed them to be imported into many , but not all , countries without import taxes , duty or vat . the krugerrand family originally only one size was issued , which contained one full troy ounce ( 31.1035 grams ) of fine gold . this was originally known as a krugerrand , or kruger , for short . from 1980 , three other sizes were introduced , namely a half , quarter , and tenth ounce size . because of these , the original krugerrand is sometimes referred to as a " full " or " one ounce " kruger or krugerrand , although within the trade , the word kruger or krugerrand is understood to be the full sized original one ounce version . british investors missed out at the time of the kruger 's introduction , it was not legally possible for british residents to acquire bullion gold coins , so that the krugerrand was almost unknown in britain until 1971 . low premium over gold content according to the publicity at the time , the kruger was to be made available to world bullion dealers at a 3 % premium over the current gold fix , so that after distribution costs , the coins would be available to investors in quantity at about 4 % to 5 % over intrinsic gold values , and possibly 10 % premium for single pieces . higher premium on smaller sizes the fractional sizes were issued at higher premiums to bullion dealers of 5 % , 7 % , and 9 % respectively . the fractional coins have never been as popular as the full one ounce coins , usually only being purchased as singles , so that in practice , it would usually cost 10 % to 15 % premium for the half and quarter ounce , and from 20 % to 50 % premium for the tenth ounce , most of which seem to have been used in jewellery . most bullion houses do not want the bother of handling small quantities of low value coins . as an example of this , in the 1970 's we , as a small provincial dealer , would frequently handle 500 krugerrands in a single day , but a purchase of 100 tenth krugerrands was a major event , yet it was only 1 / 50 th the size of deal ! not a pretty sight krugers were never intended to be an aesthetically pleasing coin , just a lump of gold with a known weight and value . they certainly can not be called pretty . collectors seeking aesthetically attractive coins would be better looking at british gold sovereigns , or some of the newer bullion coins . vat introduced in 1973 in britain vat was imposed on all coins , except antiques . in january 1995 , this was relaxed on almost all second - hand goods , including gold coins . this means that existing privately owned coins can be traded by dealers under a " special scheme " whereby the only vat chargeable is on the dealer 's margin , which is negligible . because vat was still payable on any " new " coins , it remained more difficult and expensive to buy and sell large quantities of bullion coins . continuous service from chard throughout the whole of this time , chard have maintained a dealing service for both collectors and investors in bullion and numismatic coins . during the period from 1965 to 1971 , we were one of only a small number of dealers who were granted a dealers licence . technical specifications the following tables summarise the specifications of all the sizes . size face value weight fineness gold content gold content rands grams /1.000 grams troy ounces full 10 33.9305 .917 31.104 1.0000 half 5 16.9653 .917 15.552 0.5000 quarter 2.5 8.4826 .917 7.776 0.2500 tenth 1 3.3931 .917 3.110 0.1000 size remedy ( grams ) min diam ( mm ) max diam ( mm ) min thick ( mm ) max thick ( mm ) edge 1 oz + 0.07 32.61 32.77 2.74 2.84 180 1/2 oz + 0.035 26.93 27.07 2.115 2.215 150 1/4 oz + 0.02 21.94 22.06 1.788 1.888 140 1/10 oz + 0.01 16.45 16.55 1.25 1.35 115 table notes we understand " remedy " to mean the excess weight which the coins are designed to have to allow for any manufacturing tolerances . the 1 / 12 th of the alloy which is not gold , is copper . min . = minimum . max . = maximum . diam . = diameter . thick . = thickness . edge = number of edge serrations if you ever get bored with counting your wealth in krugerrands , you can always check the number of edge serrations ! prices gold bullion prices fluctuate constantly . we do n't try to maintain a current price quotation on our website . please contact us if you wish to buy or sell krugerrands . when this page was originally created , we could offer krugerrands at 7 % premium for singles , and 5 % or � 10 premium for quantity of ten or more , over the intrinsic bullion price . please refer to our krugerrands for sale page for pricing . postage & packing uk registered post ( special delivery ) � 5 per order eu insured post � 10 per order usa airmail $ 10 per order usa insured shipping $ 20 per order_nn _ _ does discrimination against women in terms of pay propel them into entrepreneurship ?

war governments managed the economy using keynesian policies up until the beginning of the 1970s . then keynesian theory ran into trouble as unemployment and inflation began to rise together - a phenomenon known as stagflation . at this point another economist stepped in - milton friedman . he was known as a monetarist , and along with a number of other monetarist economists at chicago university did a lot of work trying to explain what caused inflation . however , the conservative government of the 1980s gradually became disillusioned with monetarism and then returned to a modern variation of classical economic management - neo - classical economics . like classical economics , it stresses the role of free markets in delivering the best possible level of economic growth . for more details on each of these areas , use the links in the side panel or below :_: _ _ 8 interactive input and output this module deals with the interaction between a user and the program via the standard input and output devices ( keyboard and screen ) . data represented by characters , which is a human readable form , are transferred to and from the program . during the transfer process the data are converted to or from the machine readable binary form . in particular the layout or formatting of the data will be considered . a subset of the formatting facilities is presented as the full set is complicated and a number of the features are rarely used . the process of i / o can be summarised as : the internal hexadecimal representation of a real number may be be1d7dbf which corresponds to the real value 0.000450 which may be written as -0.45e-03 this conversion of the internal representation to a user readable form is known as formatted i / o and choosing the exact form of the character string is referred to as formatting . the formatting of i / o is the underlying theme of much of this module . consider the i / o statements used in the previous modules : 8.1 format statement the format statement may be used to read or write data in a form other than the default format . a format statement is a labelled statement and may be used by a write or read statement within the same program unit by specifying the label number as the second parameter to either or by use of a keyword , for example : read ( * , 100 ) i , j write ( * , 100 ) i , j read ( * , fmt=200 ) x , y write ( * , 200 ) x , y ..... 100 format ( 2i ) 200 format ( 2f10.6 ) formatting is sometimes known as i / o editing . the i / o is controlled using edit descriptors . the general form of a format statement is label format ( flist ) where flist is a list of edit descriptors which include i , f , e , es , en , d , g , l , a , h , t , tl , tr , x , p , bn , bz , sp , ss , s,/ , : , ' , ( , ) only the following will be covered i , f , e , es , en , a , x,/ , : , ' , ( , ) many edit descriptors can be prefixed by a repeat count and suffixed with a fieldwidth . thus in the two examples given above , 2i and 2f10.6 , could be described as two integers and two floating - point real numbers with fieldwidths of 10.6 ( a description follows ) . the labelled format statement may be replaced by specifying the format descriptor list as a character string directly in the write or read statement , as follows : read ( * , ' ( 2i ) ' ) i , j write ( * , ' ( 2f12.6 ) ' ) x , y this has the advantage of improved clarity , i.e. the reader does not have to look at two statements which may not be consecutive in the source listing to determine the effect of the i / o statement . however , format descriptor lists may be used by more than one i / o statement and a labelled format statement reduces the risk of introducing inconsistencies between the multiple instances of the descriptor list . 8.2 edit descriptors edit descriptors specify exactly how values should be converted into a character string on an output device or internal file , or converted from a character string on an input device or internal file . the edit descriptors are defined in terms of the following key letters a repeat count w width of field - total number of characters m number of digits d digits to right of decimal point e number of digits in exponent the i / o statement will use as many of the edit descriptors as it requires to process all the items in the i / o list . processing will terminate at the next edit descriptor which requires a value from the i / o list . 8.2.1 integer i , iw , iw.m - integer data may be repeated i.e. ai , aiw , aiw.m if w is too small to represent the number then on output w asterisks are printed and on input the leftmost w digits are read for example : i i6 i10.3 5i 4i6.4 i6.4 specifies a total of 6 characters including a sign with a minimum of 4 digits thus : write ( 6,`(i10.6 ) ` ) 56 would ouput two spaces followed by 0056 8.2.2 real - fixed point form fixed point notation for real numbers possible forms : f , fw , fw.d af , afw , afw.d if no decimal point is supplied d digits are read as the fractional part . for example : f10.5 f12.6 5f14.7 f12.6 specifies a total of 12 characters including decimal point and where required a minus sign with 6 digits following the decimal point , thus : write(6,`(2f12.6 ) ` ) 12.6 , -131.4567891 would output ^^^12.600000 and -131.456789 where ^ represents a space 8.2.3 real - exponential form floating point notation for real data possible forms : e , ew , ew.d , ae , aew , aew.d the total fieldwith w includes the signs and decimal point the e descriptor specifies a number in the following form s0.xxxesxx where s signifies a sign , x digits and the character e separates the mantissa from the exponent on output the exponent is adjusted to place the most significant digit to the right of the decimal point eg . 0.123e-2 two alternative forms are available en - engineering - the exponent is always divisible by 3 and the value before the decimal point lies in the range 1 .. 1000 es ( scientific ) - the value before the decimal point always lies in the range 1 .. 10 8.2.4 character possible forms : a , aa , aw , aaw use to read or write single characters or character strings if a fieldwith w is greater than the number of characters then the characters are right justified and space filled on input the character string does not need to be enclosed in quotes 8.2.5 skip character positions ax - skip specified number of characters on input characters are ignored on output the required number of spaces is written 8.2.6 logical l - logical data on input t , f , .true . , false . are acceptable on output t or f will be written 8.2.7 other special characters / specifies take a new line : terminate i / o if list exhausted ( ) group descriptors , normally for repetition e.g. 4(i5.5,f12.6 ) ` output the character string specified 8.3 input / output lists input / output lists are used to specify the quantities to be read in or written out . on output expressions may be used but variables are only permitted for input . implied - do loops ( see below ) may be used for either input or output . an array may be specified as either to be processed in its entirety , or element by element , or by subrange ; for example : integer , dimension(10 ) : : a read ( * , * ) i(1 ) , i(2 ) , i(3 ) read ( * , * ) i read ( * , * ) i(1:3 ) array elements may only appear once in an i / o list , for example : integer : : i(10 ) , k(3 ) k = ( /1,2,1/ ) read ( * , * ) i(k ) would be illegal as i(1 ) appears twice . 8.3.1 derived datatypes i / o is performed on derived data types as if the components were specified in order . thus for p and t of type point and triangle respectively , where type point real x , y end type type triangle type ( point ) a , b , c end type the following two statements are equivalent read ( * , * ) p , t read ( * , * ) p%x , p%y , t%a%x , t%a%y , t%b%x , t%b%y , t%c%x , t%c%y an object of a derived data type which contains a pointer may not appear in an i / o list . this restriction prevents problems occurring with recursive data types . any pointers in an i / o list must be associated with a target , the target is the data on which the i / o statement operates , for example : real , pointer : : ptra , ptrb real , target : : x x = 10.0 ptra = > x write ( * , * ) ptra would output the value 10.0 , whereas write ( * , * ) ptrb would generate an error as ptrb is not associated with a target . 8.3.2 implied do loop the implied - do - list , which is often used when performing i / o on an array , has the general form : ( do - object - list , do - var = expr , expr[,expr ] ) this syntax is similar to the simple indexed do loop described earlier . consider the following examples : integer : : j real , dimension(10 ) : : a read ( * , * ) ( a(j),j=1,10 ) write ( * , * ) ( a(j ) , j=10,1,-1 ) the first statement would read 10 values in to each element of i. the second statement would write all 10 values of i in reverse order . the implied - do - list may also be nested integer : : i , j real , dimension(10,10 ) : : b write ( * , * ) ( ( b(i , j),i=1,10 ) , j=1,10 ) note : no do - var may be a do - var of any implied - do - list in which it is contained , nor be associated with such a do - var ( eg . pointer association ) . in an input implied - do - list a variable which is an item in a do - object - list may not be a do - var of any implied - do - list in which it is contained . 8.4 namelist this is a facility for grouping variables for i / o. the rules governing the use of namelist are fairly complex so , for the scope of this course , only explicitly declared variables will be used , pointers and allocatable arrays will not be covered . the use of namelist for output only will be considered as this can be useful for program testing and debugging . it 's use on input is slightly more complicated and is best considered only where necessary . the namelist statement is used to define a group of variables as follows : namelist namelist - spec where namelist - spec is /namelist - group - name/ variable - name - list for example namelist /week/ mon , tues , wed , thurs , fri the list may extended within the same scoping unit by repeating the namelist - group - name on more than one statement , as follows : namelist /week/ sat , sun more than one group may be defined in one namelist statement but this feature should not be used . variables should be declared before appearing in a namelist group . variables with the private and public attributes should not appear in the same namelist - group . the namelist - group may be used in place of the format specifier in an i / o statement . only the write statement is considered here . write ( * , nml = week ) will produce & week sun=1 , mon=2 , tues=3 , ..... / where integer : : sun , mon , tues , ..... sun = 1 mon = 2 ..... note the output record is an annotated list of the form : & namelist - group - name namelist - variable = value { , namelist - variable = value } / this record format must be used for input . arrays may also be specified , for example integer , dimension(10 ) : : items namelist /group/ items items(1 ) = 1 write ( * , nml = group ) would produce & group items(1)=1 , items(2:10)=0 / 8.5 non - advancing i / o the normal action of an i / o statement is to advance to the next record on completion . thus on input if a record is only partially read the rest of the input record is discarded . on output a write statement will complete with the cursor positioned at the start of a new line . non - advancing i / o permits records to be read in sections ( for example a long record of unknown length ) or to create a neat user - interface where a prompt for input and the user 's response appear on the same line . there is a complex set of rules covering the use of non - advancing i / o and its various associated keywords . this section only deals with the screen management aspects of this topic . the advance keyword is used in write or read statements as follows : read(*,*,advance='yes ' ) ... write ( * , * , advance='no ' ) .... there are two optional keywords , eor and size , which have the form : eor = eor - label size = integer - variable the eor keyword specifies a labelled statement to which control is passed if an error occurs ( see err keyword later ) or if the end of record is encountered . the size keyword specifies an integer variable which is set to the number of characters read . by default unfilled characters in an input record are padded out with blank characters but these characters are not included in the value assigned to size . the pad keyword to the open statement ( see later ) may be used to override the default action . examples . ( i ) write(*,*,advance='no ' ) ' enter new value : ' read ( * , * ) i if the user enters the value 10 this would appear on the screen as enter new value : 10 ( ii ) character(len=32 ) : : filename integer : : length bb : do write ( * , * , advance='no ' ) ' filename ? ' read(*,*,advance='no',eor=20 , size = length ) filename open(10 , file = filename(1:length ) , .. ) exit bb 20 write(*,'(/a , i ) ' ) ' error : maximum length exceeded.',length end do 8.6 exercises what values would be read into the variables in the read statement in the following : real : : a , b , c real , dimension ( 1:5 ) : : array integer : : i , j , k read ( * , * ) a , b , c read ( * , * ) i , j , k , array given the following input records : 1.5 3.4 5.6 3 6 65 2 * 0 45 3 * 23.7 0 0 given the statements : real : : a character(len=2 ) : : string logical : : ok read ( * , ' ( f10.3,a2,l10 ) ' ) a , string , ok what would be read into a , string and ok if the following input records were used ? ( a ) bbb5.34bbbnob.true . ( b ) 5.34bbbbbbybbfbbbbb ( b ) b6bbbbbb3211bbbbbbt ( d ) bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbf where b represents a space or blank character . write statements to output all 100 elements of a one dimensional array of real numbers with 10 numbers per line each in a total fieldwidth of 12 and having two spaces between each number . the array should be output in fixed point notation with 4 characters following the decimal point and then in floating point notation with three significant digits . hint : an implied do loop is useful when grouping array elements on the same line . write a program which will initialise all the elements of a suitably declared array to 123.456789 and will test the output statements you have just written . what would happen if the initial value was -123456789.789 ? a file contains records in two groups with each group headed by a specification of the format in which the following data is to be read . each group of data is terminated by the special value 99.9 . write a program to read in all the data . the general form of the input is known i.e .. he first group will contain 3 reals and an integer and the second group one real and an integer . example data : ' ( 3f6.4,i5 ) ' 3.40 5.6 7.9 10 4.52 6.3 3.2 11 99.9 0 0 0 ' ( f6.1,i10 ) ' 4.23 9 5.89 6 99.9 0 [ next ] [ previous ] [ top ] all documents are the responsibility of , and copyright , � their authors and do not represent the views of the parallel computer centre , nor of the queen 's university of belfast . maintained by alan rea , email a.rea@qub.ac.uk generated with cern webmaker_nnp _ _ privacy policy please close this window when finished , or print this page using the print button in your browser . if you have any question or queries , close this window and choose ' contact us ' from the menu on the left . your details are never knowingly sold , rented or disclosed to any third party outside of gra ltd unless they are undertaking marketing or market research on our behalf when you supply information through this website the following privacy policy will apply . this is in addition to our standard ( off -

" avner 's theme " binds the film together while " a prayer for peace " brings both solace and hope . more ... great film fantasies - music by john williams and howard shore although there are many cds available with a selection of film music tracks , this latest release has a unique aim - to cover three of the great fantasy series of modern cinema . music from all six " star wars " films is included , the first three " harry potter " films ( those scored also by john williams ) and the " lord of the rings " trilogy scored by howard shore . the combination of conductor erich kunzel and the cincinnati pops orchestra is superbly qualified to pull off this release in a way which pays full tribute to the strengths of original film recodings , yet demonstrates a new interpretation to heighten their appreciation . more ... sheet music for " pride and prejudice " - by dario marianelli if you 've enjoyed listening to dario marianelli 's music for pride and prejudice and also play the piano , then you must check out music notes sheet music from the film . each track is available for immediate download in digital format using the links below or for postal delivery you can order the music book which contains all 12 tracks . dawn stars and butterflies the living sculptures of pemberley meryton townhall georgiana arrival at netherfield liz on top of the world leaving netherfield another dance the secret life of daydreams darcy 's letter mrs. darcy the film music oscars john williams led the music awards this year getting the top spot in both the golden globes and the baftas for his score to memoirs of a geisha . but when it came to the oscars , it was gustavo santaolalla who won " best original score " for his music to brokeback mountain with the " best song " award going to " it 's hard out here for a pimp " from hustle & flow sung by three 6 mafia . other composers nominated for awards this year have included harry gregson williams , james newton howard , alberto iglesias , george fenton and dario marianelli . among many films winning awards , we have featured the soundtracks of walk the line , march of the penguins , crash , tsotsi , the chronicles of narnia and king kong . the three burials of melquiades estrada - marco beltrami as a composer , marco beltrami is best known for his work on horror films , starting with " scream " and its sequels for wes craven , and also including " mimic " , " the faculty " , " the watcher " and " scary movie 2 " . he was thus not an obvious choice for tommy lee jones in the three burials of melquiades estrada , his first movie as director . however , beltrami 's familiarity with the work of ennio morricone provided a connection with the western setting , and you can feel the dust of the desert and literally hear cactus thorns as the bonus video track explains . the result of this collaboration if a very effective soundtrack for this unusual movie which won both best actor and best screenplay awards at cannes . more ... match point - an operatic soundtrack written and directed by woody allen , match point is set in and around the london area in a story of passion , temptation and obsession - a tennis instructor falls for first the sister and then the girlfriend of his best friend . the film features a cast from both sides of the atlantic with the lead characters sharing an enjoyment of opera , so it is entirely appropriate that allen has chosen a soundtrack of passionate songs from the world of opera . while some of these are more recent recordings , many feature the singing talents of tenor enrico caruso . these recordings have been carefully restored to bring out the best in the performance , and impart a timeless quality to the on - screen love triangle . more ... harry gregson williams - the chronicles of narnia continuing our survey of soundtracks from blockbuster movies released this christmas , we present the chronicles of narnia : the lion , the witch and the wardrobe by harry gregson - williams , a composer who has an excellent reputation for scoring family movies . for this first narnia film , gregson - williams has provided a rich tapestry of moods and thematic ideas which takes us from london under the blitz to the house in the country , and from there into the many scenes , characters and plot threads of the story , adding richness and depth along the way . if this movie is set to follow the trend set by that other fantasy adventure " the lord of the rings " then we may see further installments in the narnia story released for future christmasses . more ... electronic film music whichever way you look at it , the creation and processing of music by electronic methods is a huge industry which grew from small seeds sown more than 100 years ago . many engineers , musicians and composers have been caught up in the electronic music revolution which now permeates many aspects of different media and music genres . with his range of instruments from the moog modular to the minimoog , robert moog ( who died in 2005 ) was one of the key players in that fascinating and complex history . in this article we pay tribute to robert moog and those other pioneers who have helped to shape electronic music into what it is today . we have also included mp3 downloads of some of our own electronic classical music . more ... james newton howard - king kong composer james newton howard was a late replacement for howard shore on the movie king kong . he was able to create all the music in a matter of a few short weeks , but alas they were not able to re - shoot the scene where howard shore conducts the orchestra to herald kong 's arrival in new york ! the core of james newton howard 's soundtrack is the love theme which bonds the giant gorilla to the heroine ann darrow , and there are some good moment accompanying the interplay between these and other characters in the movie . this is a movie of spectacle though , and the orchestral score captures the suspenseful moments leading up to the arrival on skull island followed by numerous scenes where they meet dinosaurs and other huge creatures . more ... patrick doyle - harry potter and the goblet of fire patrick doyle takes over from john williams to create the music score for the 4th harry potter film harry potter and the goblet of fire . this fantasy series and its music has become a little darker over the course of the preceding books and films as the main characters ( and the audience ) have grown up . patrick doyle retains the full symphonic scoring , with some great orchestration and solos for various sections of the orchestra maintaining the magical and fantastical texture , and heightening the emotional roller - coaster of the dramatic narrative . some of the individual tracks take the franchise briefly in surprising directions and some seem to emphasise the british setting with a new authenticity . more ... march of the penguins - by alex wurman for many people located in the northern hemisphere , christmas is associated with staying warm and snug indoors while the snow falls and blankets the surrounding countryside . this christmas spare a few thoughts for the emperor penguins in march of the penguins who spend all year round outdoors in the bitter cold of the continent of antartica . for the evocative soundtrack of this film , composer alex wurman captures the beauty of this frozen landscape , and the fascinating parental instincts of this intrepid species , who lovingly raise their young in this most inhospitable of environments . a flute provides an emotional anthem for the natual world against the more brittle landscape of piano and harp . more ... the brothers grimm - by dario marianelli closely following " pride and prejudice " , the brothers grimm is the second major soundtrack from composer dario marianelli in recent months . as you would expect for a terry gilliam film , the music instantly engages you in a dark and mysterious fantasy world . marianelli 's main theme seems to say " once upon a time " and lures you into the world of story - telling . the music puts to good use a few techniques used on many modern film soundtracks like synth effects and wordless vocals , though on the whole the score is very much of the traditional film music school with clear influences from well - known classical and film composers . those with a knowledge of classical music will no doubt have fun identifying quotations from brahms , bizet and rossini . more ... corpse bride - by danny elfman a few years ago tim burton created " a nightmare before christmas " a musical with composer danny elfman providing all the music , the songs and the voice of the main character . in many ways corpse bride is similar . it is also an animated movie by burton and elfman , with the same darkly wicked sense of humour and elfman again providing one of the singing voices . however comparisons can only give you a flavour of what 's in store . you will enjoy this film and soundtrack on its own merits , with its weird though strangely familiar story and a host of great characters which come across clearly in the songs . more ... mark isham 's crash the soundtracks of mark isham have been based on a wide variety of instrumental forces , from small intimate groups through jazz ensembles to full orchestras . his film music has included " the net " , " blade " , " the cooler " and his oscar - nominated score for " a river runs through it " . this sonic variety has been increased even further with his score to crash which consists almost entirely of computer - based sounds with a dash of solo vocals . isham describes this method of music creation as " returning to the bedroom " and , in additional to the domestic location of the composer 's equipment , the resulting music is also somehow intimate and personal . isham demonstrates his versatility by moving us with raw sound . the film will be released in the uk on 12th august and the soundtrack is available now . more ... " the producers " - the musical by mel brooks : " the producers " was one of mel brooks earliest films and also one of his best . a few years ago he adapted this into a musical format which has been a huge hit on broadway since 2001 . the show has retained mel brooks excellent comedy writing , augmented with a wealth of new song material and makes for an excellent evening 's entertainment . the show is coming to london in november and will also be opening soon in other parts of the world . a cd album is now available featuring the original broadway cast . see our review of the producers original cast recording for more information . the competition to win one of 5 copies of this cd has now closed ._. _ _ yiddish ( � ٴ � � � , jiddisch ) is a germanic language spoken by about four million jews throughout the world . the name yiddish itself means ' jewish ' and is originally short for yidish daytsh , or ' jewish german ' ; an older term in english is judaeo - german . the language arose in central europe between the 9th and 12th centuries as an amalgam of middle high german dialects that also borrowed heavily from hebrew / aramaic terms found in traditional jewish literature and from the romance languages . yiddish eventually split into west and east yiddish . the latter in turn split into northeast and southeast yiddish . modern yiddish , and especially east yiddish , contains a great many words derived from slavic languages . like judaeo - arabic and ladino ( judaeo - spanish ) , yiddish is written using an adaptation of the hebrew alphabet . however , yiddish itself is not linguistically related to hebrew , even though it absorbed hundreds of hebrew and aramaic terms taken from jewish tradition . one curious aspect of the language is that it uses latin derivatives for many of its words relating to religious rituals , apparently borrowing the terminology from old french as spoken in alsace and used by the catholic church . as an example , ' say grace after meals ' is , in yiddish , bentshn , which is apparently cognate with the same term that gave english the word benediction ; while davnen , meaning ' pray ' , is thought to be descended from the same root as the english word devotion . the yiddish verb leyenen ' to read ' also reflects a romance background . there are a handful of other words which also derive from old french , the most common of which , tsholnt ( a sabbath stew , spelled cholent in english ) , probably derives from the french words chaud ( hot ) and lent ( slow ) . largely because of the influence of jewish entertainment figures , many yiddish words have entered the american english lexicon . in 1968 , leo rosten ( 1908 - 1997 ) published his seminal the joys of yiddish ( isbn 0743406516 ) , a highly entertaining introduction to words of yiddish origin used in the english of the u.s.a. history the late 19th century and early 20th century are widely considered the golden age of yiddish literature ; this period also coincides with the revival of hebrew as a spoken language , and the revival of hebrew literature . the three great founders of modern yiddish literature were mendele mocher sforim , sholom aleichem , and i. l. peretz . solomon rabinowitz , better known as sholom aleichem ( 1859 - 1916 ) , is known as one of the greatest yiddish authors and humorists , the yiddish equivalent of mark twain . a collection of his stories about tevye the milkman was later the basis of the broadway musical and film fiddler on the roof . at the start of the 20th century , yiddish seemed to be emerging as a major eastern european language . a rich literature was being published , yiddish theater and film were booming , and it had even achieved status as one of the official languages of the byelorussian s.s.r .. yiddish emerged as the national language of a large jewish community in eastern europe that rejected zionism and sought to obtain jewish cultural autonomy in europe . in mid - century , however , the holocaust led to a dramatic , sudden decline in the use of yiddish , as the extensive jewish communities , both secular and religious , that used yiddish in their day - to - day life were largely destroyed . in the united states , the yiddish language bound together jews from many countries , whose national origin was often as important as their jewish identity . within some families , marrying across national origin lines was seen as equivalent to marrying out of the faith . american yiddish music was another binding mechanism . michel gelbart , a very prolific composer , probably best known for " i have a little dreydl , " wrote music that was very jewish and very american . in some ways this was a continuation of the conflict between hebrew ( and zionism ) and yiddish ( and internationalism ) as the means of defining emerging jewish nationalism . meanwhile , in israel , yiddish was displaced by modern hebrew . this was associated with a major battle between religious and secular forces . the larger , secular group wanted a new national language to foster a cohesive identity , while traditionally religious people desired that hebrew be respected as a holy language reserved for prayer and religious study . in the united states , most yiddish speakers tended not to pass on the language to their children who assimilated and spoke english . the major exception to this can be found in the ultra - orthodox jewish communities in new york , especially in brooklyn , as well as in some smaller ultra - orthodox communities in other cities such as london . among the european ultra - orthodox , hebrew is generally reserved for prayer and religious studies , while yiddish is reserved for daily life . in 1978 yiddish writer isaac bashevis singer received the nobel prize in literature . yiddish words and phrases used by english speakers ai - ai - ai ( sometimes spelled " ai - yi - yi " ) - an exclamation of strong emotion bagel - a hard ring - shaped bread roll blintz - a sweet cheese - filled crepe ( from yiddish blintse ) bubkes ( also spelled " bupkis " ) - nothing , as in he is n't worth bubkes ( from yiddish bobkes ' little beans ' ) chutzpah - audacity , effrontery ( from yiddish khutspe ) genug - enough gonef - thief ( from yiddish ganef , from hebrew ganav ) goy - gentile ( from yiddish goy , plural goyim , from hebrew goyim meaning ' nations ' , i.e. , the nations outside of israel ) klutz - clumsy person ( perhaps from yiddish klots ' wooden beam ' ) kosher - conforming to jewish dietary laws . slang : appropriate , legitimate . kvell - beam/ be proud kvetch - complain ( from yiddish kvetshn ' press , squeeze ' ) lox - smoked salmon ( from yiddish laks ' salmon ' ) macher - big shot , important person ( e.g. within an organization ) maven - expert ( from yiddish meyvn , from hebrew mevin ' one who understands ' ) mazel - luck mazel tov ! - congratulations !

" and ... what kind of a man is david grove ? " an interview by penny tompkins and james lawley picture the scene : a peerless november night in the lake district . a backdrop of mountains dark against a sky so clear it is obvious why our part of the universe is called the ' milky ' way . three heads protrude above the surface of a steaming hot tub . not a sound can be heard save the occasional lapping of water as each slides and settles into an even more relaxing position . one of the heads , david grove , is a new zealander currently living in the usa and making one of his regular pilgrimages to england to conduct healing retreats and workshops for therapists . he has developed a unique way of working with the metaphoric and symbolic nature of our inner worlds . he is continually expanding and refining his approach as he discovers more about the structure and processes of the magical faculty of humans to represent their deepest experiences as metaphor . penny tompkins and james lawley are about to conduct an interview . let 's listen in on what they 've got to say . james : what might be useful is for people to know a bit about your background and how you became interested in nlp . where would you like to start ? david : my first association with nlp was back in 1978 . at first i was n't interested in the therapy side , i really wanted it for business . one time i went along for an nlp business workshop and they said " oh i 'm sorry , not enough people have showed up , you 'll have to join the other group . " so that 's how i first became interested in phobias and trauma . penny : what were richard bandler , john grinder and the others doing at that time that attracted you ? david : the whole notion that you could take an experience , find its structure and if you changed its structure it changed the experience was revolutionary . that to me was the significant contribution from the mid 70 's ; just the notion that experience had a structure and that structure could be categorised and that you could make changes to experience without it coming through insight and feelings . that was the major paradigm shift ' the boys ' made at the time , which really started the nlp bandwagon rolling . penny : so you went along for business and got interested in the structure of experience . then what happened ? david : then i got very involved in ericksonian hypnosis . and i think one of the key things i did was set up a little study group . there were six of us . we 'd meet every couple of weeks and we 'd go over some of this stuff . each of us would do a presentation . that was when i found out they were sitting there listening but they could n't understand a word i was saying . i thought , " we 've all been to the same workshops , why could n't they understand me ? " and then i realised i was moving in a different direction . it was hard to distinguish at that time but i was interested in a different structure of experience . after that i pretty much just started out on my own with a friend who 's been my office manager ever since . i was based here in england to start with . and it was pretty unsuccessful . that was the beginning of my working with traumatic memories and phobias . and when i went back to the states , the whole viet nam war post traumatic stress syndrome was really picking up . there was nothing in the literature that i could find about people trying to resolve memories . james : was there a particular time or incident that alerted you to the power of the use of metaphor ? david : no , not really . i mean david gordon wrote his book but there was nothing else out at that time . james : your work with metaphor is radically different from erickson 's or david gordon 's use of metaphor . how did that evolve ? david : i found out not everybody had memories . however , even though they could n't remember a certain event they still had feelings about it . so if you ca n't get a clear memory , what else can you get ? so i started observing very carefully what was happening . i noticed , if i did n't force people when they were talking they would naturally start using metaphor to describe their experience . and that 's when i discovered this work is very amenable to metaphor . so i realised here was another way to structure experience . i decided that metaphor was a whole language worthy of study . it took me a few years just to study the different types of metaphorical language . so that eventually became a book resolving traumatic memories . gee , that thing is still selling today . james : you 're talking about naturally occurring client - generated metaphors . about symbolic representations that occur within a person 's body or inner perceptual world . so what do you see is the function of metaphor in your work ? david : essentially what metaphors do is carry information . metaphors take information from one source and introduce it to another . so , imagine someone has a symptom of ' a knot in the stomach ' and through the use of ' clean language ' they have a corresponding memory that someone is about to hit them . maybe they can take the knot out of the stomach and put it in the memory and the knot ties the perpetrator 's hand 's and prevents them from being hit . thus the client has successfully resolved the situation by picking up the metaphor and carrying it across into a memory in which it can do the business . the information contained in the metaphor transforms that memory . penny : so metaphors related to the client 's symptoms contain information which lead to the resolution of their traumatic memories . the metaphor is not only symbolic of the problem it also contains pointers , clues , to the solution . david : working with metaphors leads to a natural regression and hanging around the metaphor is always an owner who is the client at a younger age ' frozen in time ' . that 's how the notion of a ' child within ' was born . penny : what was your relationship with the others who were using ideas of the ' inner child ' at that time ? david : charles whitfield pioneered it in the states . i 've done stuff with him and we 're still friends . claudia black did the acoa stuff ( adult children of alcoholics ) and then alice small did books on incest . i probably pioneered the clinical side of it in america . i just started from nothing and was getting huge audiences at that time in the late 80 's . and then i got very intrigued with dissociation . it seemed a lot of metaphor and the child within were fragments which were dissociated . so i decided to take a vow of silence for 2 years . i stopped teaching just to study dissociation and fragmentation . and that 's when i started to do retreats in my home . i thought my research would take 2 years but its taken me a lot longer and out of that came even more new material . penny : such as ? david : i discovered , if you put people into trance , they regress and go back into childhood . if they leave their eyes open and you follow where they are focussing then they get to worlds that appear from thin air , in their perceptual space . and because people can choose to go in and out of positive hallucination when they 've got their eyes open , they have more control . so this was a rude awakening because it was the opposite tenant of working with the client to get the metaphors generated from within . with their eyes closed clients do n't make contact with the outside . but when they keep their eyes open you can observe how their ' line of sight ' gives clues to their internal perceptual space . it 's like the nlp stuff except now there 's a context , an inner landscape , to make more sense of eye movements and other minimal cues . penny : it 's ironic , you have to open your eyes to see your ' internal world ' ! is this when you realised people 's perceptual space , their inner landscape , could be mapped ? i know in my own work with you , drawing metaphors and mapping their location has been a real navigational aid . it has helped me keep track of my own process and encouraged new insights . david : i call this ' cognitive mapping ' . the map is the interface between the client 's internal and external worlds . the map mediates both realities . there is a big difference between metaphors that give a microscopic view of one experience and a map which gives a picture of all experiences . that realisation took me by surprise . james : earlier you mentioned the use of ' clean language ' by the therapist . this seems to be central to your work . what put you on to the idea that clean language was so important , and perhaps you might like to say what defines clean language . david : i used to watch other therapists work . i wondered , why did they ask that question ? i started analysing the questions major therapists used ; people like virginia satir and carl rogers . to begin with i thought it was because they had this huge vast experience . after a while i twigged that , jeepers , they were coming out of their hallucinations , their model of the world . take carl rogers , who i thought would be really ' rogerian ' ! i found his language was n't clean in the sense that he kept shifting people . he would use past tense in the present , and then use the future tense and move them back to the present . so he was often redefining verbally whatever anybody said . he would amplify or redefine the words the client used . well , when you do that it robs the client of some of their experience . i wanted to know the questions you can ask that do n't have any presuppositions . erickson did n't use clean language but at least he was aware of the presuppositions of his language . so i came up with a set of six basic questions which were neutral and did not interfere with a client 's process . and they all start with the conjunction ' and ' ... and what that does is facilitates a trance . so the use of clean language is very trance inducing without an induction . it 's a natural induction because the questions do n't pull the client out of their experience . the questions are aimed at the metaphoric part of their experience so they do n't go through normal cognitive processes . penny : can you give us an example ? david : if you ask " and that 's like what ? " it 's clean language as it directly addresses the client 's experience and it goes straight to the metaphor . whereas , if you ask " what 's that like to you ? " the client immediately goes to cognitive process and looses their direct relationship with the particular metaphor . so clean language is the language of facilitation . it does n't bring the client out of their natural trance and there is no resistance to the questions because they can be answered easily . the acoustical parameters in clean language , the rhythm and tonality , are such that a person can reject the question very easily without much ego affect . i want the client to chuck out any question that does n't feel right . so clean language is language that stays in the experience and in the body of the client . the locus of the information is out here between two people . its not a shared language as in normal discourse . in normal counselling i ask the question to you , you get the information and then you give it to me so it 's a whole shared experience . the locus of attention moves backwards and forwards between us . but once i ask you a clean language question , the locus shifts from you to where the information is sourced without it having to be triangulated between your head and your body . that is why you do n't have to think about answers to clean language questions , because the answers come from the source of the information . so any question that drags you out of the experience is not clean language . for example , when a client repeats your question it is a good indication the question was n't the right one . so clean language is about a delivery system that delivers a question without any resistance . it 's about a question that 's just the right question a client wants to be asked . as soon as the question is asked , the client already knows . the ability to get the question that feels right to the client and that they can easily reject if its not , is the art of clean language . in clean language , you 're only as good as your last question . and it does n't matter what else you were going to do , if you did n't get the last question right . the use of conjunctions of language and the use of the indefinite article make it a funny , unusual language , but it 's very simple . it 's a natural language of trance . james : one of the by - products of using clean language , it seems to me , is that there is a natural separation between the metaphor and the person observing the metaphor . they get a chance to look at whatever it is in a way they probably never have , from an angle they 've never been aware of before . david : yes . there is a separation in that you separate out the ego state of the person and then you objectify the experience so it becomes the client interrogating this other entity in metaphor . i ask the metaphor directly for information and it can answer . and the client is often amazed , amused and somewhat bemused about it . in that sense the client has a discourse with the metaphor . the client becomes a dispassionate observer of what 's going on . so in order to get that type of information you need to split it from the client 's current experience and then it takes on a life of its own . and the reason why that stuff 's there is because it has information in it . the metaphor is a carrier of information . penny : you work with people who have had disturbing symptoms , memories and so forth , for a long time . how does working with metaphor allow a process that 's been a source of pain for decades to be healed ? clients will often say they 've had this problem for as long as they can remember . david : that 's a very intriguing question because some symptoms seem to be very intractable . what makes them intractable ? i had this notion : what if you did n't stop at childhood ? what if there were conditions contained in your family of origin that were passed on ancestrally ? what if the anger that you have is simply a continuation of your father 's anger ? what if the depression that you experience is an endemic depression and is carried down your family line , and is simply not an expression of situational depression ? so that led to a sortie into the world of genealogy . when i pursued the origins of a particular symptom i found there are some experiences which are not arrived at as a child ; they are not born in childhood . you may be a carrier of information passed on for generations and it expresses itself in you . it might have missed your siblings . it might have missed your parents . the depression is not from you . so then your ordinary resources , those resources within your own experience , are n't sufficient to heal the situation . so sometimes you do n't have everything you need to heal yourself . penny : because you did n't create it in the first place . david : the stuff has been passed on . the symptoms are trying their best to heal the situation , but ca n't . the metaphor is a container which not only contains information about your symptoms but also your history . ancestral history gets devolved . you have to treat the historical information and treat the symptoms separately . when those two are meshed together you ca n't do anything with them . so this began this whole fascinating journey into the use of ancestry to heal up an experience that occurred in childhood . the beating , the abuse you got may have been a punishment which did not fit the crime . if the crime did n't deserve that punishment , where did the motivation to punish come from ? james : during today 's workshop we saw how a participant 's traumatic memory of school was still influencing their life today . i was amazed how the process unfolded . you explored the ancestral history of the teacher in order to discover a redemptive metaphor which was used to heal the child at school . then you brought the healed metaphor into the present . david : you 've got to ' pull back ' a teacher 's history , or the country 's history employing teachers . there will be something in that teacher 's history or something in the system that will heal . so the client gets the opportunity to go back and heal up their ancestry . then they can pick up all of their ancestry and re - import it back into their body . and then they do n't have the past interrupting their present . one of the nice things in relation to inter - generational healing is that you can by - pass your parents and access some of your lineage directly , without having to go through the negative stuff they passed on . instead of having your lineage cut off because of your parents , you can go back and re - own your history . that gives you access to all of the bright stuff that was there without it having to be filtered through your parents ' negative aspects . to go back and heal up your ancestry can be a very stunning thing to experience . penny : this explains how you can go from a minimal cue , like a hand movement or a look , and go straight into a really important experience for the person in a few questions . david : clean language does that . because in every gesture , and particularly in obsessional gestures and tics and those funny idiosyncratic movements , is encoded the entire history of that behaviour . it contains your whole psychological history in exactly the same way that every cell in your body contains your whole biological history . penny : and it is the same for words and phrases ? david : that 's why we ca n't go around changing client 's dialogue , because then you change the experience and you ca n't unfold their history out of your words . james : so sometimes when symptoms are intractable , clients have had too much of their experience changed , many times by - well meaning therapists . as paul watzlawick says , the attempted solutions become the problem . fortunately , the metaphor preserves the information in an uncontaminated form . and are you saying the resolution of the symptom is in the history ? david : yes . there will always be good things in the history as well as bad . three sisters could be exposed to the same stimulus but their reactions might be very different . one might carry the experience in a positive way , one might carry it in a negative way and one does n't carry it at all . the question is : how can that happen ? now when you ' pull back ' sentences from each of those sisters you 'll find they probably go down different ancestral lines . so when you have your first virginal anxiety experience why did you respond that way and not a thousand other ways ? i think we are predisposed . there is a susceptibility in that particular person . james : how come the sisters do n't have the same predisposition if they have the same ancestry ? david : that 's the question . because their lineage is traced back in different ways . and it would depend on what you pulled back . if you pull back on the pain in the chest it goes down one line , if you pull the breathing back it goes down another . and then there is one sister who does n't have any affect so it 's no big deal and there is nothing to pull back . james : so what 's your idea about how that predisposition and that information is transmitted down the line ? david : i have no idea . i mean it 's the same question about sisters with different hair type and eye colour . where do we get our initial psychological characteristics from ? i mean what genes carry our psychology ? penny : hey , we 're asking the questions here ! how far do you carry the biological model into the psychological model ? david : i think it 's the same deal . i think feelings are like antibodies . feelings are unsuccessful attempts by your body to heal a situation when it first happens . if that does n't work , any other situation resembling the original will keep manufacturing the symptoms . it 's like cell division ... over and over again . as i see it , psychology is going to have to follow medical science , and we 're way behind . at first , all medical science had was gross description of pathology and that 's where psychology is now . medical science has moved on to the greater level of detail of molecular biology and the replication of systems and diseases . i think that 's the way we 're going to have to go in changing experiences . it 's about replication , not the end product . james : how do we influence a system that replicates pathologically ? i am intrigued by how to interrupt a system 's ability to replicate . david : the way you do that is the same way nature does it . most cell division is mitotic ; the cell clones or produces an exact replicate of itself . the psychological equivalent is when a set of symptoms from an earlier experience reproduce themselves in the adult , over and over again . a different mechanism is involved in sex cell division . the process is called meiosis where there is a crossing over in which genes are exchanged from one set of chromosomes to another . unlike cloning , the resultant genetic structure is different from the original . that 's how the inter - generational healing works . we 're going back and picking up information in metaphors from your ancestry and then we 're bringing them into your lifetime . this exchange of information changes the outcome of your current experience . then the old experience will not replicate itself . so for example , if a mother is too busy and you were left alone with a person who became the perpetrator of a traumatic event , then you might have to go down the ancestral line of the mother to find the source ; to find the redemptive metaphor . where was your mother ? how come she was too busy ? this is where the client might need to go to find the information which can interrupt the replicating mechanism . metaphors are like the genes of cells or the dna -- genetic codes that replicate . so if we want to change a repetitive or habitual experience , it 's the replicating mechanism that matters . james : the structure of those mechanisms is the same whether we 're talking about physical structures or metaphorical structures . they 're the same . david : yes . find those structures so we can intervene at this level . it 's different from trying to change the content . it does n't matter about content . and why i think this intergenerational stuff is so powerful is because you 're using transformative information from the source . when you find the ' line of sight ' of that source information , it 's not just any angle of the eyes . that information is not sourced with you , its sourced in your ancestry , and that shifts the responsibility . penny : empowerment is a word that 's bandied about a lot ... now this is empowerment . david : well it ends up that way . it 's a funny thing to start off with that premise when initially there is an unempowering situation . you do n't get empowered until later , until you find the source . penny : the neat thing is you can take a behaviour or a line of sight or a symptom and with clean language discover a metaphor and trace that back to its ancestral source . there you find a redemptive metaphor -- a metaphor which contains the information needed to heal , not only the initial conditions , but the whole lineage in between . and that makes a big difference . i know -- i 've experienced it and it has had a significant effect in my life ! david : that 'll do . penny : thank you and please pass me a towel ! references : david grove and b i panzer resolving traumatic memorie ' ( irvington)1989 david gordon therapeutic metaphors ( meta publications ) 1978 charles whitfield healing the child within ( health communications ) paul watzlawick et al . change : principles of problem formulation and problem resolution ( norton ) 1974 also by david grove : resolving problem domains through metaphor therapy -

politik context of the invasion of iraq : the significance of oil , the strategic importance of iraq , the cia 's long record of suppressing democratic movements in the middle east . it also ignores the history of us imperialism , with its record of human rights abuses , black ops and puppet dictatorships . it portrays the illegal detentions , torture , killings and other abuses committed by the occupiers in iraq as aberrations , unrepresentative of the nature of the occupation . above all , it betrays a racist assumption : a belief that iraqis , left to their own , ca n't build democracy or human rights . arnove alls for the � immediate withdrawal of all us and international troops from iraq � . he gives eight reasons why the us and its collaborators should leave iraq immediately . first , the us and british military have no right to be in iraq . given that the invasion was illegal , so is the occupation . it 's not a defence for a burglar to argue that he has a right , indeed a moral and legal obligation , to remain in the house he 's burgled because he suspects its occupiers ca n't look after it . second , they are not bringing democracy to iraq . that was not the purpose of the invasion . iraqi popular opinion forced the us to hold two elections . even then the occupiers tried to subvert the process and promoted the notion of a strictly sectarian political choice for iraqis . despite the election not returning the us 's favoured option , the occupiers make sure that they pull the strings of any new government . third , the occupation does not make the world a safer place . other countries ( israel , russia , india ) dub their opponents � terrorists � and cite us - uk behaviour as precedent for their own atrocities . countries labelled as � rogue - states � note that iraq was vulnerable precisely because it did n't have weapons of mass destruction and thus escalate the nuclear arms race . fourth , the us and britain are not preventing civil war in iraq . rather , they deliberately foment sectarianism , a traditional weapon of colonisers . the western media is obsessed with the kurd - shia - sunni divide . in truth , and even now , kurds , shias , sunnis live side by side in most cities . they inter - marry , and live and work together . sectarianism , particularly against the kurds , was certainly fomented by saddam hussein . the occupation has taken that to new extremes , fostering sectarian - based political parties and construing resistance to the occupation as sectarian violence and even permitting ( or perhaps encouraging ) its iraqi allies to engage in such violence . what is clear that the longer the occupation continues , the more sectarianism will increase . fifth , the us and britain are not fighting terrorism in iraq . the occupation of iraq and other manifestations of the � war on terror � have made us all more at risk of terrorist attack . iraqi civilians face a murderous double whammy : they are victims of state terrorism conducted by the us and britain as well as home - grown acts of violence . sixth , we are not honouring those who died by continuing the conflict . it is a strange argument that justifies future deaths as a necessary memorial to those who have already died . bush says � we will honor their sacrifice by staying on the offensive against terrorists � . cindy sheehan replies � why should i want one more mother to go through what i 've gone through , because my son is dead? � . seventh , the occupiers are not rebuilding iraq ; they are looting the country . of the $ 18.4 billion allocated by the us congress for � reconstruction � , less than half has been spent . electricity , water and sewage supplies do n't work . hospitals are in chaos . unemployment has sky - rocketed . lucrative contracts are handed to multi - national corporations ( haliburton being the principal beneficiary ) and a blind eye is turned as money is misspent , siphoned off , unaccounted for , and private companies fail to deliver and do n't even employ iraqis . untapped oil reserves are sold to multi - nationals ( the iraqi federation of oil unions is campaigning hard to keep the existing oil reserves in public ownership ) . aggressive privatisation and neo - liberalism are being written into the constitution . finally , the us and britain are not fulfilling their obligations to the iraqi people by occupying their country . we certainly do have an obligation to iraqi : to make reparation for 12 years of sanctions , the deaths of over half a million children , for unleashing death from the skies throughout the 1990s , for the invasion of 2004 and the civilian deaths , poverty and instability that have followed . and further back : for arming both sides in the iran - iraq war , for selling arms to saddam hussein , for helping to suppress democratic movements in iraq over many decades . reparations can not be made at gunpoint . reparations require military withdrawal followed by a massive influx of cash distributed by democratically elected politicians , cancelling the whole of iraq 's debt , working to eliminate land mines , combat the effects of depleted uranium , and prosecuting bush , blair and others for war crimes . the earlier the withdrawal , the sooner iraqis can start to rebuild their country . but what are the factors that might make withdrawal a reality ? arnove identifies five forces that ultimately led to the us withdrawing from south east asia : mass resistance by the vietnamese people ; resistance by us soldiers and veterans ; domestic opposition ; international protest and the growing economic consequences of the war . the reference to vietnam is poignant . arnove 's title is taken from howard zinn 's book � vietnam : the logic of withdrawal � which was published in 1967 . the us withdrew from south east asia five years later . those five years claimed the lives of a million vietnamese and thirty thousand americans . it 's the job of the anti - war movement to make the occupation untenable in the us and britain now , so that iraqis do n't have to repeat the suffering of the vietnamese . public opinion generally thinks that there should be a withdrawal , but is less certain about when it should be . arnove 's book is an invaluable tool for engaging with the arguments that arise whenever the occupation is discussed . it makes an unanswerable and urgent case . iraq : the logic of withdrawal is published by the new press . liz davies is a barrister , long - standing peace and labour movement activist , vice - chairwoman of the haldane society of socialist lawyers and involved in iraq occupation focus . this column first appeared in the morning star ._. _ _ baby carriers getting out and about with your baby need n't be a pipe dream . our range of superb littlelife baby carriers lets you carry your baby in comfort whether it 's the urban jungle or the wilderness of the africa . designed by expedition leaders , the littlelife range are tough but incredibly comfortable . we hold stock of the voyager , cross country , traveller and ultralight carriers . our premax baby sling , carry me and hippychick hip seat provide versatile and comfortable solutions to baby travel ._. _ _ this page contains information and guidance to help visitors when using this site . we are continually working to improve the accessibility and usability of our content but if you are experiencing any difficulties downloading files or accessing a particular page please contact the hm treasury web team for assistance . if you are having trouble finding what you 're looking for , read our � frequently asked questions site audience and purpose the treasury website contains more than 4,000 documents , from press releases , to consultation documents to budget reports and spending reviews . this site is intended to cover the information needs of different potential audiences -

day the word � genius ' , like many in the english language , has become much over used in recent years and in consequence greatly devalued . there are , however , few men who more richly deserve this description than the � forgotten hero ' reginald joseph mitchell . in so far as the general public recognises his name , reginald ( rj ) mitchell is forever linked as the designer of the iconoclastic spitfire fighter plane . his achievements , however , were so much more . within freesasonry , even fewer will know of his membership of the craft from aged 26 until his tragically early death aged 42 . mitchell was born in 1895 at longton , stoke - on - trent , one of five children . his father was a yorkshire teacher who later owned a significant printing company in the area . mitchell senior was himself a freemason and the founding organist and later master in 1923 of jasper lodge no . 3934 meeting ( as it still does ) at hanley , stoke - on - trent . it was into this lodge , on friday , 13th may 1921 , that r j mitchell was initiated as a lewis . mitchell 's education and early years gave little indication of what was to come . there is anecdotal evidence that as a youngster he was already fascinated by the new invention called the airplane ( it should be remembered that it was only in 1903 that the wright brothers achieved powered flight and several more years before any working airplane flew over britain ) . otherwise his education was unremarkable . he was clearly bright , and a competent athlete but , as is so often the case , little to mark him out at that stage of his life . indeed , at his father 's insistence , mitchell was apprenticed at 16 to a local electrical engineering company , a job he apparently hated . he also attended night school , where he later taught for a time . it must have come as a bolt from the blue when , having applied for and secured a job in faraway southampton with the small supermarine company , he told his family of his immediate move to take up the appointment . the company he joined was a modest part of the newly - created british aviation industry , and at the time supermarine specialised in building seaplanes . such planes had many advantages during this period , not least the ease of finding somewhere to land ! it was at supermarine that r j mitchell did all his work as an aircraft designer . when the company was absorbed into the vickers industrial empire in 1928 , mitchell was made a director , and his financial was situation enhanced considerably ._. _ _ the dna sequence of the human x chromosome the human x chromosome has a unique biology that was shaped by its evolution as the sex chromosome shared by males and females . together with colleagues in the usa and germany , we have determined 99.3 % of the euchromatic sequence of the x chromosome . our analysis illustrates the autosomal origin of the mammalian sex chromosomes , the stepwise process that led to the progressive loss of recombination between x and y , and the extent of subsequent degradation of the y chromosome . line1 repeat elements cover one - third of the x chromosome , with a distribution that is consistent with their proposed role as way stations in the process of x - chromosome inactivation . we found 1,098 genes in the sequence , of which 99 encode proteins expressed in testis and in various tumour types . a disproportionately high number of mendelian diseases are documented for the x chromosome . of this number , 168 have been explained by mutations in 113 x - linked genes , which in many cases were characterised with the aid of the dna sequence .

" bad enough , poor fellow ; but i think i can pull them both round . nothing vital , you see , touched , and these mauser bullets make wonderfully clean wounds ! " " and the other ? " " bad flesh - wounds -- great loss of blood . i just got at that artery in time . " west heard these words spoken by someone whose head kept getting in his way as he lay staring up at the great bright stars directly overhead , and it seemed very tiresome . he tried to speak and ask whoever it was to move aside ; but his tongue would not stir , and he lay perfectly still , trying to think what it all meant , and in a dull far - off sort of way it gradually dawned upon him that the people near him were talking about the boers he had somehow or another and for some reason shot down . then , as he thought , the calm feeling he was enjoying grew troubled , and he began to recall the fact that he had been shooting somebody 's ponies to supply somebody else with food , and that he must have been mad , for he felt convinced that they would not be nice eating , as he had heard that the fat was oily and the flesh tasted sweet . besides which , it would be horrible to have to eat horseflesh at a time when his throat was dry with an agonising thirst . then the terrible thought forced itself upon him that while shooting down ponies he had missed them and killed men instead , and once more all was blank . the next time the power of thinking came to the poor fellow all was very dark , and a jarring pain kept running through him , caused by the motion of his hard bed , which had somehow grown wheels and was being dragged along . cattle were lowing and sheep bleating . there were shouts , too , such as he knew were uttered by kaffir drivers , and there were the crackings of their great whips . after a while he made out the trampling of horses and heard men talking , while in an eager confused way he listened for what they would say about those two wounded boers , one of whom had nearly bled to death before that artery was stopped . these , he felt , must be the boers he shot when he ought to have shot ponies . and as he got to that point the trouble of thinking worried his brain so that he could think no more , and again all was blank . at last came a morning when west woke up in a great room which seemed to be familiar . there were nurses moving about in their clean white - bordered dresses , and he knew that he was in some place fitted up as a hospital . several of the occupants of the beds wore bandages suggestive of bad wounds , and to help his thoughts there came from time to time the dull heavy reports of cannon . he did not recollect all that had preceded his coming yet ; but he grasped the fact that he had been wounded and was now in hospital . he lay for a few minutes with his brain growing clearer and clearer , and at last , seeing one of the nurses looking in his direction , he tried to raise one hand , but could not . the other proved more manageable , and in obedience to a sign the nurse came , laid a hand upon his forehead , and smiled down in his face . " your head 's cooler ! " she said . " you 're better ? " " yes , " he replied : " have i been very bad ? " " terribly ! we thought once that you would not recover . " " and ingleborough ? " " ingleborough ? oh , you mean your companion who was brought in with you ? " west nodded : he could not speak . " well , i think he will get better now ! " " but his wound : is it so bad ? " " he nearly bled to death ; but you must not talk much yet . " " only a little ! " said west eagerly . " pray tell me , he will get better ? " " oh yes : there 's no doubt about it , i believe . " " oh , thank goodness ! " cried west fervently . " but what place is this ? " " this ? why , kimberley , of course ! " " ah ! " cried west excitedly , and his hand went to his breast . " my jacket ! " " your jacket ? " said the nurse . " oh , that was all cut and torn , and soaked with blood . i think it has been burnt . " " what ! " cried west . " oh , do n't say that ! " " hush , hush ! what is this ? " said a deep , stern voice . " patient delirious , nurse ? " a quiet , grave - looking face was bent over west 's pillow , and the poor fellow jumped at the idea that this must be the surgeon . " no , sir ; no , sir ! " he whispered excitedly , catching at the new - comer 's arm . " i am better : it is only that i am in trouble about my clothes . " " clothes , eh ? " said the doctor , smiling . " oh , you will not want clothes for two or three weeks yet . " " not to dress , sir , " whispered west excitedly ; " but i must have my jacket . it is important ! " " why ? " said the surgeon , laying his hand upon the young man 's brow soothingly . " i was bringing on a despatch from mafeking when i was shot down , sir , " whispered west excitedly . " it was sewn up for safety in the breast . " " indeed ? " said the doctor , laying his fingers on the lad 's pulse and looking keenly in his eyes . " yes , sir , indeed ! " said west eagerly . " i know what i am saying , sir . " " yes , you are cool now ; but i 'm afraid the jacket will have been burned with other garments of the kind . of course , the contents of the pockets will have been preserved . " " oh , they are nothing , sir , " cried west piteously . " it is a letter sewn up in the breast that i want . it is so important ! " " well , i 'll see ! " said the doctor gravely , and , signing to the nurse who had been in attendance , he left the ward , with west in a state of feverish anxiety . at last , to west 's intense satisfaction , the horribly blood - stained garment was brought in , and his hand went out trembling to catch it by the breast , fully expecting to find the missive gone . " yes , " he cried wildly , " it is here ! " " hah ! " cried the doctor , and , taking out his knife , he prepared to slit it up , but west checked him . " no , " he panted : " the commandant . send for him here ! " " my good lad , he is so busy , he would not come ! let me cut out the message and send it to him . " " no , " said west firmly ; " i will not part from it till he comes . " " but really-- " " tell him a wounded messenger from mafeking has a letter for him , and he will come . " west was right : the magic word mafeking brought the commandant to his bedside ; and as soon as he came up he stopped short and made what little blood poor west had left flush to his face , for he cried : " hullo ! why , it is our illicit - diamond - dealer ! i thought we were never to see you again ! " " it is not true ! " cried west . " the man who denounced me lied ! " " then you have been to mafeking ? " " yes , sir : mr. ingleborough and i. " " and brought back a despatch ? " " yes , sir : here it is ! " " where ? " said the commandant , glancing down at the stained tunic on the bed . " open it now , sir , " said west to the doctor , who took out his knife again , slit the cloth , and drew out the big letter , terribly soaked with its bearer 's blood . " bravo ! brave messenger ! " cried the commandant , grasping west 's hand before tearing open the packet and finding enough of the despatch unstained to allow him to decipher the principal part of the text . " hah ! " he cried , when he had finished , " on the whole good news ; but , " he continued , glancing at the date , " you have been a long time coming . " " have i , sir ? we lost no time ! " " the poor fellow has been lying here for a fortnight , sir , " said the surgeon . " a fortnight ago ? why , that was the day when the reconnoitring party returned with the captured sheep and cattle . yes , i remember now : they had a brush with the boers up the river . of course , yes : they were attracted by the firing , and saved two young englishmen . you are one of them ? " " yes , sir . " " well done , then ! our raiding party did good work , though they did have a desperate fight afterwards to get through the boer lines . getting better ? " " yes , sir , " said west , with a sigh of relief : " now that i have got my despatch safely into your hands ! " " but what about your bad character ? " " it was a false accusation , sir ! " cried west indignantly . " the man who denounced me was the criminal himself . " " well , you have done your duty so truly that i believe you in preference to him . " " but i shall be able to fully clear myself , sir , soon , for this man is a prisoner now with the cavalry brigade . has that come into the town yet , sir , with the prisoners , guns , and the convoy they captured ? " " hah ! " cried the commandant : " this is news indeed ! has the brigade captured all you say ? " " yes , sir , " said west , and he told all that had taken place up to the time of he and ingleborough being cut off and chased by the boers . " we knew nothing of this ! " said the commandant . " we are prisoners ourselves ; but your news gives us hope of a speedy release , for the general is not one to let the grass grow under his feet . " " he is not , sir ! " said west . " then you shall bring me and the man who accused me face to face . " " the sooner the better , my lad ! " said the commandant warmly . " how soon will he be up , doctor ? " " within a fortnight , i hope , sir ! " was the reply . " then goodbye for the present , my lad ! " said the commandant . " your long - delayed despatch will send a thrill of hope through all here in kimberley , for it breathes nothing but determination to hold the boers at bay . " " may i say one word more , sir ? " said west excitedly . " what do you think , doctor ? " " he has said enough , sir , and if he talks much more we shall have the fever back . well , perhaps he 'll fret if he does not get something off his mind . " " what is it , then ? " said the commandant . " i had a brave comrade to ride with the despatch , sir . " " to be sure , yes , i remember . what about him ? not killed , i hope ? " " no , sir , but badly wounded , and lying somewhere here . " " poor fellow ! i must see him . there must be promotion for you both . " " if you would see him , sir , and speak to him as you have spoken to me , " said west , with the weak tears rising to his eyes . " of course , yes ! there , shake hands , my lad : you have done splendidly ! do n't worry about the diamond charge ! i can feel that it was a contemptible lie ! now , doctor , take me to your other patient . " " ha ! " sighed west , nestling back on his pillow with a calm look of content in his eyes , which closed directly after for a sleep that lasted ten hours at the least . | next chapter | | previous chapter | | contents | e - books created from nineteenth century or early twentieth century texts by athelstane e - texts ._. _ _ visitbritain offers a national quality assurance standard for visitor attactions - the visitor attraction quality assurance service ( vaqas ) . the scheme is very broad based as it can be applied to any type of attraction , which may include : castles , historic houses , gardens , parks , estates and monuments churches and cathedrals industrial / craft premises farm - based attractions wildlife centres , zoos , safari parks and nature reserves museums and galleries transport theme parks others hampton court palace , the national railway museum , manchester united museum and tour and the lost gardens of heligan are just four of the 300 plus attractions that have been accredited by the vb 's visitor attraction quality assurance service ( vaqas ) . vaqas has been developed to provide tools which can be used by attraction operators to enhance quality and spread best practice within the sector . christopher howard , quality assurance manager at vaqas , said : " the service offers a consumer - focused quality assessment that identifies strengths and also highlight any areas for development . we do not grade attractions , but assess each on its own merits using objective quality benchmarks provided by the industry " . the visits are made annually and are carried out during normal public opening hours . vaqas assessments take into account the whole visitor experience , including pre - arrival and arrival , the attraction itself , toilets , catering and retailing . each assessment is followed by a one to one debrief . the debrief provides live feedback on the visitor experience . this provides objective advice , based on examples of best practice drawn from the attractions industry , offering a useful management tool . finally , providing the criteria are met , the visitor attraction receives the accreditation of ' quality assured visitor attraction ' and the use of the national quality marque . south west tourism commercial members are entitled to a discount off the standard vaqas fees . for further information regarding membership please see the membership section . for more information on the visitor attraction quality assurance service ( vaqas ) contact the vaqas helpline on 01473 825633 the regional tourist board for the south west of england_nnp _ _ domestic conveyancing for paralegals & trainees cpd : 4 hours ( management ) the annual conveyancing conference for paralegals , trainees and newly qualified solicitors , will cover the following topics:- � the water environment ( controlled activities ) ( scotland ) regulations 2005 and the contaminated land ( scotland ) regulations 2005 � missives update and how best to avoid traps � artl update � noting a title -- what to look out for , including p16 reports revealing boundary discrepancies � update on servitudes and real burdens michael mcmillan of burnett & reid will again be in the chair . speakers will include alasdair sampson , drummond miller , dougie airbright , registers of scotland and the convener himself . full day conference from 10.00am -- 3.30pm fee : � 95.00 + � 16.63 vat = � 111.63_cd _ _ advanced high - speed signal propagation howard johnson 's new workshop for digital and analogue designers 29 - 30 june 2006 " very practical ! real situations that exist at work . this analysis will save us as things go faster .

" the expression of the emotions in man and animals " ( 1872 ) proposed the idea that the basic emotions we experience are common to all human races across all periods of history . the evidence for this , darwin argues , lies in the fact that there are striking similarities in the facial expressions by which these emotions are registered . expression of the emotions interview : professor beer explains ... dame gillian beer was king edward vii professor of english literature at the university of cambridge , and president of clare hall , cambridge . among her works are " darwin 's plots " and the world classics edition of darwin 's " the origin of species " . icons talked to her about why she thinks darwin 's book was so significant when it was published , and why it is still troubling today ... interview : professor beer explains ... saddled with darwin once upon a time the young soon -

1975 checkpoint fan poll eighteen people voted in this , the fourth british fan poll since the days of skyrack ; nineteen people voted last year . the poll covered british fanac from easter 1974 to easter 1975 , though these dates were only used as a rough guide . all fans were eligible to vote , though ballots were only distributed through checkpoint . the following fans voted : harry bell , graham charnock , lisa conesa , malcolm edwards , david griffin , rob jackson , roy kettle , dave langford , mike meara , darroll pardoe , rosemary pardoe , greg pickersgill , john piggott , graham poole , brian robinson , paul skelton , keith walker , and ian williams . best british fanzine : twenty - two different titles were nominated , fourteen of which received more than one vote . five points were awarded to a first place vote , four to the second , and so on down to one point . checkpoint itself was ineligible . last year 's position is in brackets . 1 ) true rat ( 44 points ) ( 8th ) edited by roy kettle , 74 eleanor road , london e8 . ( available for trade , loc , & c ) . three issues eligible ( 1974 - 5 ) . the roguish wit and gay sophistication of leroy kettle has long been a feature of london fandom , where his salty quips and easy bonhomie have entertained visitors and residents alike . until recently roy 's considerable writing talents were readily absorbed by fouler and wadezine ; but with the disappearance of these fanzines he turned to true rat and small - time pornography . the former has proved quite successful . though with a tiny circulation , mostly in britain and italy , true rat has won the hearts and the minds of its fannish readership . the reasons for this are perhaps obscure : the layout is spontaneous , the composition mercurial , and the subdued artwork is coaxed from the typewriter itself . essentially , therefore , true rat 's unique charm lies with the editor , with roy 's innate literary sensibility -- a certain sprachgef � hl which gives the fanzine its piquancy and sheer phrenetic force . it 's also pretty funny . the second issue , subtitled true rat too , has a photo - montage cover , an unusual feature for any ratzine . the contents , as usual , are almost entirely roy 's own work , from the anagrammatical editorial , " real idiot " , to " my convention by peter r.weston ( form ii b ) " , " uncle esoteric and his amazing facts " , and " media breakthrough by rich coad " which tells of comic book heroes such as captain cancer and lieutenant leper . even the letters are written by roy . true rat 3 , the " exciting all - misery issue " continues in the same vein , whilst the fourth issue is no more than a single page , designed to win the nova award and embarrass john brosnan . true rat 5 contains the novacon report which has won the ' best article ' section of this checkpoint poll ; it also has the regular scandal column , " open flie " , letters , and an advert for was god a poof ? . altogether , therefore , true rat is a fine fanzine -- lots of laffs and more quips that you know what to do with . 2 ) wrinkled shrew ( 32 points)(- ) edited by pat charnock , 70 ledbury rd , london w11 . ( available for trade , loc , & c ) . three issues eligible ( 1974 - 5 ) . dissatisfied with her role as " wife of the ex - editor of phile " , pat charnock decided to do something -- and came up with the wrinkled shrew . it 's a fairly large , eclectic publication , notable for its inspired covers and pretty good duplication . though it would qualify as a genzine , since it includes various outside contributors , the shrew is first and foremost a personalzine , displaying the various talents of pat charnock , her splendid cats , and her impish husband . the first issue has a bizarre mixture of contents : chris priest on " status quo " , fiction by both pat and graham charnock , a tynecon report , selected letters from graham hall , oddments from charles platt and dick howett , and various strange items by the cats . in other words , this initial shrew contains enough material to keep the average british fanzine going for two or three years -- i still have n't finished reading it yet . the second and third issues are more restrained , with pieces by cas skelton , dave garnett , and malcolm edwards , as well as the continuing letters of graham hall , assorted charnocks ' prose , and a letter column . well , there we are . the wrinkled shrew wo n't make grown men pull their heads off , but it 's a good fanzine nonetheless . 3 ) egg ( 29 points)(- ) edited by peter roberts , 6 westbourne park villas , london w2 . ( available for trade , loc , etc ) . two issues eligible ( 1974 - 5 ) . the publication of egg can be considered as one man 's battle against overwhelming lethargy ; last year , for example , i managed to produce no issues at all , and even this time i only found the energy for two pretty thin eggs . in a cosmic sense this clearly reflects the universal slide into entropy and the great , silent void ; but in a personal sense it reflects my congenital laziness . no matter . the eighth egg contained a short fannish parody by gray boak , " a boy and his scarf " , a second piece on the politics of the heicon , this time by waldemar kumming , and a regular column by john brosnan , " north sea nog " . the letter column was pretty timeless , which was just as well , since most of the locs were a couple of years old . the ninth issue appeared just after the seacon and was notable for its decadent cover , a product of the charnock 's splendid tastelessness . greg pickersgill made a rare appearance inside with the hideous tale of a star trek convention ; the editor wrote an equally rare article , whilst eric bentcliffe contributed fanzine reviews and john brosnan continued his column . the tenth egg is promised at some future date . let 's leave it at that . 4= ) inferno ( 20 points)(- ) edited by paul & cas skelton , 25 bowland close , stockport , cheshire , sk2 5nw . ( available for trade , loc , & c. ) . three ( ? ) issues eligible ( 1974 - 5 ) . inferno is a straightforward personalzine that 's gradually emerged from the moribund world of the british apas -- so quietly that i missed the earlier issues . it 's distinctively produced in an octavo format , neat and largely illustrated by paul skelton himself ; the contents are loosely tied into a personal diary , producing a strange mixture of editorial ramblings , letters , reviews , diatribes , and assorted oddments . with a british circulation of less than twenty , it might seem surprising that inferno polled so well ; after all its predecessor , hell , a more substantial genzine , never attracted much attention . the answer is that this new personalzine is a lively , entertaining publication -- the old hell never really got off the ground and was , in a word , boring . inferno certainly is n't that . 4= ) zimri ( 20 points)(1st ) edited by lisa conesa , 54 manley rd , whalley range , manchester , m16 8hp . ( available for trade , loc , & c. or 25p ) two issues eligible ( 1974 - 5 ) . joint winner of the 1974 nova award and outright winner of last year 's fan poll , zimri remains one of the best british genzines currently being published . the drop to fourth place this year reflects less on the quality of the fanzine than on the changing tastes of the voters : this is the era of the personalzine , after all , and lisa has always seemed to keep her distance in zimri . both the sixth and seventh issues are large -- seventy pages of a4 each -- and they 're impressively illustrated with the graphic work of harry turner who is now established as the art editor . zimri 6 starts off with brian aldiss 's " twelve magnificent ways to die " and follows this with an assortment of items : an interview with slawomir mrozek , fiction by rob holdstock ( no less ) , an account of the voyage to see the solar eclipse , an ompacon report by john hall , pieces by ted tubb , harry turner , and ian williams , book reviews , guest fanzine reviews by greg pickersgill , and finally a lengthy letter column . the seventh issue , partly printed , partly duplicated , has an interview with john brunner , more fiction from rob holdstock , pieces by jo withisone , harry turner , chris priest , and ian williams , and the usual reviews and letters . zimri has had two fine issues this year , therefore , and , after a short - lived rumour to the contrary , now looks well - established . there 's a hint of the bigger & better syndrome at work , with the multicoloured covers and the move towards printing ; but i 'm confident that lisa wo n't fall into that potential trap -- and checkpoint , of course , is never wrong ! next five : 6 ) maya ( 18 points)(- ) edited by rob jackson . = 7 ) triode ( 13 points)(- ) edited by eric bentcliffe . = 7 ) spi ( 13 points)(- ) edited by graham poole . 9 ) cypher ( 10 points)(- ) edited by jim goddard . 10 ) big scab ( 9 points)(- ) edited by john brosnan . there 's been some considerable movement , therefore , in the top ten . out from last year 's list are : vector , blunt , cynic , ritblat , hell , magic pudding and erg . true rat attracted the largest number of voters ( 12 ) this year , whilst inferno received the largest number of first place votes ( 3 ) . best single issue : thirteen issues of eleven fanzines were nominated . 1 ) true rat 5 ( roy kettle)(3 votes ) . 2 ) spi 2 ( graham poole)(2 votes ) . best british fanwriter : twenty - three people were nominated , thirteen of them receiving more than one vote . points were awarded as in the ' best fmz ' section and last year 's positions are again given in brackets . 1 ) roy kettle ( 55 points)(6th ) . well , what can you say ? with fourteen people voting for him , roy won this section with even more ease than the ' best fanzine ' one . there 's worse to come too -- if he 'd torn a stencil artistically , he 'd have won the fanartist poll , for sure . so it goes . anyway , roy 's fanwriting has been largely confined to his own true rat , apart from a rare letter elsewhere . it 's very funny , very good , and i 'm damned if i 'm going to say any more than that . 2 ) john brosnan ( 25 points)(3rd ) . apart from editing big scab , a jont winner of the 1974 nova award , john has spent the last year filling the pages of sf monthly and vertex , and has also had another book published . big scab would doubtless have done better in the poll if it had appeared in the last couple of months ; but apart from writing in this personalzine cum scandal sheet , john has turned up in other fanzines such as egg , where he has a regular column , ' north sea nog ' . 3 ) peter roberts ( 19 points)(9th ) . that 's very civil of you all . thanks . i have n't , i 'm afraid , done anything very much -- just writing for my own fanzines , egg , the little gem guide , and the last of the pre - pardoe checkpoints , with a few other oddments and letters thrown in . 4 ) greg pickersgill ( 17 points)(2nd ) . greg has probably been more active this year than last ; but his fanzine , ritblat , appeared early on in the year and fans have notoriously short memories . his trenchant fanzine reviews have , however , turned up in zimri and egg published the fearful tale of the first british star trek convention . 5 ) pat charnock ( 15 points)(- ) . to the best of my knowledge , pat has stayed with her own fanzine , wrinkled shrew , writing articles , editorials , and even fiction for it . graham charnock , incidentally , came in 11th . the cats did n't make it ( you damn voters are just prejudiced ) . next five : 6 ) gray boak ( 13 points)(4th ) 7 ) bob shaw ( 12 points)(- ) = 8) ian williams ( 11 points)(5th ) = 8) paul skelton ( 11 points)(11th= ) 10 ) eric bentcliffe ( 6 points)(- ) best article or report : eight pieces were nominated ( one vote each , except : ) 1 ) roy kettle -- novacon report in true rat 5 ( five votes ) . best british fanartist : twenty people were nominated , thirteen of them receiving more than one vote . points were awarded as in the ' best fmz ' section and last year 's positions are given in brackets . 1 ) harry bell ( 49 points)(2nd ) . harry has once again topped the poll -- the third time in four years -- and his artwork , mostly cartooning , has obviously proved to be as popular as ever . recently he 's branched out from the gannetzines of the north east and has been seen in american fanzines , as well as uk ones . 2 ) harry turner ( 26 points)(3rd= ) . harry turner once again kept within zimri , where he 's had good opportunity to demonstrate his skill as an artist ( and writer too ) . his cover for the sixth issue was once of the winners of the ' best cover ' section . 3 ) andrew stephenson ( 25 points)(1st ) . less evident in fanzines this year , andrew has nonetheless continued to produce some excellent science fiction artwork , notably the cover of the seacon programme book which was voted joint first with zimri 6 . 4 ) dave rowe ( 18 points)(3rd= ) . another fanartist who 's been fairly quiet this year , dave has nonetheless continued to provide material for british fanzines ( and a couple of american ones ) , including a cover for the final lurk . 5 ) paul skelton ( 17 points)(7th ) . paul is rapidly becoming the new all - round fan , since he makes his appearance in the ' best fanwriter ' -- he 's also on the mancon committee ! his cartoonwork has enlivened his own fanzine and others in the uk . next five : 6 ) jim pitts ( 15 points)(- ) 7 ) terry jeeves ( 12 points)(13th= ) = 8) dick howett ( 10 points)(- ) = 8) steve jones ( 10 points)(- ) = 10 ) john mottershead ( 7 points)(- ) best fanzine cover : eleven covers from ten fanzines were nominated . = 1 ) zimri 6 -- harry turner ( 2 votes ) . = 1 ) seacon programme book -- andrew stephenson ( 2 votes ) . there it is , then . another fan poll bites the dust for another year . one less voter than last year makes this the lowest turnout so far . a few people whom i expected to vote did n't , but perhaps they 're no longer subscribing to checkpoint . still , i 'm quite content -- and , after all , all but one of the voters this time are fan - editors , so i reckon that makes the results of some considerable interest . checkpoint is published by darroll pardoe , 24 othello close , hartford , huntingdon , pe18 7su . it 's available for trade , news , or 12/ � 1 ( 12/$3 us ) . this supplement to the 63rd issue is edited by peter roberts , 6 westbourne park villas , london w2 , and is being sent to all voters in the 1974 - 5 fan poll . a few copies are available for 12p ( inc.post ) . retormel press publication : 98 . 15th june , 1975 . that old urge : to print news , that is ... with apologies to darroll , i 'll use this space for any oddments i have on hand that might be of interest . hugo voting : the deadline for final ballots is july 15th . aussiecon members in europe can send them to me , if they wish . little gem guide : a revised edition will be ready in august . meanwhile , there are still a few copies of the last ( printed ) edition available for 15p -- the new one will be more expensive , i 'm afraid . fillostrated fan dictionary : i now have a copy of the first two volumes and i hope that further copies will arrive soon . 70p is the price , if you are interested . sae for details . sf artwork : i have some copies of a hungarian journal , interpress grafik , with a 50 page article on east european science fiction artwork . it 's very glossy and profusely illustrated -- and expensive too . sae if you 're interested . it 's in english , by the way !

century printed books of hours was stated to reduce the time one spent in purgatory by a few days or hundreds or even thousands of years . but letters of indulgence depended on payment - although , in theory , a doctrinal requirement of repentance was retained . printed indulgences were ready - made receipts with a space left for the name of the purchasers . the church used indulgences to raise money for specified purposes , although it was often doubted how much of the money was actually spent that way . the sale of indulgences was farmed out to commissioners , contractors who would keep a proportion of the takings as payment . chaucer 's pardoner sold such indulgences , although it is not mentioned that he actually gave out written letters by way of receipt . the pardoner . from the second edition of the canterbury tales , f.ff8 v. the british library g.11586 for the church , having indulgences printed meant a rationalisation of an otherwise labour - intensive procedure . compared with writing them out by hand , they could be produced at much reduced cost and much faster . a printer could probably produce nearly a thousand a day , from a single press . for the printer this type of publishing would have provided a very welcome income , especially in times when he had substantial sums tied up in the production of large books . caxton 's first surviving indulgence is from 1476 , the year in which he probably also finished the first edition of the canterbury tales . we do not know how many copies were printed of any of caxton 's indulgences , but we do know that a london institution , which farmed out the sale of indulgences , received payments corresponding to the sale of about 30,000 a year . despite the few surviving copies , indulgences may have played an important role in caxton 's financial success as a printer ._. _ _ caring about fun reva klein this article focuses on a few of the pilot healthy care programmes , which have prioritised arts provision for looked after children . the aim is to give children and young people the opportunity to express themselves using the arts , and to have some fun . read article > > a commission to care angela neustatter the author interviews al aynsley -

year research and evaluation project which concentrates on the introduction of a cross - curricular theme , education for mutual understanding ( emu ) , to the school curriculum . the project is structured in three overlapping stages . stage one involved research into how those within the education system perceive emu . these perceptions , and their implications for policy , are the subject of this report . the next stages of the project are already underway . they involve working with teachers in a number of schools to see what approaches seem most fruitful in evaluating the impact of emu . the outcomes will be the subject of a future report . legislation to include emu in the curriculum was introduced in 1989 , but the statutory requirement does not affect schools until september 1992 . in the intervening period , those in the education system have begun to consider the implications of emu 's transition from a voluntary activity to a formal requirement . the report is therefore timely and reflects changes in thinking during this important period of transition . its findings provide a further contribution to the evolutionary debate about the nature and purpose of education for mutual understanding and i welcome its publication . seamus dunn director , centre for the study of conflict may 1992 . return to publication contents introduction conflict in ireland has a history which extends over centuries . the most recent manifestations of sectarian violence in northern ireland have been a feature of life in that society for over twenty years . whilst underlying causes are the subject of considerable debate , the conflict itself has come to be typified as a conflict between two communities , most frequently described as catholic or nationalist and protestant or unionist . such simplifications undoubtedly do great disservice to the majority of individuals who , despite their different religious practices or political aspirations , do not use violence as a means of resolving disputes . however the existence of separate institutions to serve these two communities has focused attention on the relationship between social policies and the dynamics of the conflict . this report is concerned with education as one such social policy area . in northern ireland most children from the catholic and protestant communities are served by separate school systems . recent legislation , the education reform ( northern ireland ) order 1989 , brought about change involving policies directed at both the structure and process of education . policies in education affecting relationships between the two communities include : government support for the creation of ' integrated schools ' which are attended by both catholic and protestant children ; the introduction of funding mechanisms designed to bring about a more equitable distribution of resources within the education system and which may contribute to a decrease in the differential between catholic and protestant pupils in terms of academic achievement ( standing advisory commission on human rights , 1991 ) ; the introduction to the formal school curriculum of two educational themes , known as education for mutual understanding ( emu ) and cultural heritage , which may contribute to the improvement of relations between the two communities ; continued funding and support from the department of education for activities involving contact between catholic and protestant children ; funding and support from the department of education for the activities of voluntary organisations involved in reconciliation work with young people . this report is about the policy to include education for mutual understanding ( emu ) as a mandatory part of the school curriculum for all pupils in northern ireland . it arises from a research project based at the centre for the study of conflict in the university of ulster at coleraine . project methodology the initial phase of this project has sought to understand how those within the education system perceive emu and how it might be implemented . two aspects of the research are reported here . the first focused upon individuals who work within the support and advisory domains in the education system . most have some responsibility for advising teachers how emu might be developed in practice . twenty such individuals were interviewed during the 1990 - 91 school year . a supplementary exercise was also carried out which asked these individuals to log their communications concerning emu during one specified week . the exercise provided some initial evidence about the level and form of communication within the network of individuals involved with emu . the second aspect of the research focused upon post - primary schools since they will have a major responsibility for implementing emu in practice . a postal survey of all post - primary schools in northern ireland was carried out in june 1991 and information was sought on a number of issues including what teachers perceive emu to be about , what sort of activity is already taking place within the school , and how emu might be implemented in the future . as a supplement to this questions were also asked of a parent governor in each school and these responses are summarised in appendix a. recommendations findings from the studies provide the basis for a number of recommendations and it is hoped that these offer a starting point for fruitful discussion as education for mutual understanding makes the important transition from a voluntary to a statutory feature of the curriculum in schools in northern ireland . the recommendations are outlined in more detail in chapter 8 but , in general terms , they refer to four main areas : a clearer conceptual framework for emu - the need for greater clarity concerning the diverse concepts which are associated with emu for example , clearer understanding of the emphasis which may be placed on community relations issues , or the relationship between the cross - curricular theme and activities involving cross - community contact . better co - ordination - the need to improve co - ordination between the various agencies with a responsibility or concern for the implementation of emu . better training - the need to give more priority to training and in - service education for teachers in support of emu . support for evaluation - the need to support schools as they find ways to evaluate the impact of including emu in the curriculum . return to publication contents chapter seven : summary of findings advisory and support domains within advisory and support agencies there are multiple interpretations of emu individuals are likely to carry an interpretation of emu which is related to their own interests or biography most respondents working within statutory agencies found interpretations which associate emu with ecumenism unhelpful there is little co - ordination between agencies concerning emu education and library boards there are constraints on the extent to which education and library boards will be able to support emu , particularly in terms of providing adequate substitute cover for training those working within boards experience little time or opportunity for strategic planning the only publicly available statements of policy from boards are brief statements which relate to the situation when emu was not statutory there is very little documentation on emu available from boards to inform schools and parents of how it will be supported cross community contact scheme school participation in the scheme has grown steadily since it was introduced in 1987 during the 1990 - 91 school year over a quarter of all primary schools and over a half of all post - primary schools received funding from the scheme the impact of the scheme on schools may have increased the perception that emu is only about contact a number of issues regarding the scheme were raised by respondents including : what level of support to schools the scheme will be able to sustain in the long term whether central administration of the scheme is appropriate in the long term many respondents felt that community relations branch should consider how it might support aspects of emu which do not necessarily involve cross - community contact voluntary agencies movement of emu on to the curriculum means that voluntary agencies are concerned that their particular contribution may become marginalised some voluntary agencies have found it more difficult to provide training opportunities for teachers as a result of education reform the funding of voluntary agencies on a short - term basis makes long - term planning and staffing difficult voluntary agencies are concerned to evaluate their own work but need support to do this post - primary schools although schools recognise the wider dimensions of emu the term is generally perceived as a shorthand code for community relations work nearly two - thirds of post - primary schools surveyed have yet to develop a formal policy on emu in the short term schools may develop emu mainly by creating more cross community contact with other schools most respondents were concerned that contact should be meaningful ' and not undertaken simply because of financial inducement or for publicity the schools surveyed also saw potential for developing emu by considering how the school ethos reflects values associated with the theme . respondents thought this would be more achievable than securing the involvement of every area of the curriculum over three quarters of the post - primary schools surveyed have appointed co - ordinators for emu although there is some uncertainty as to what their role should be emu has already become closely identified with particular subjects - history , english , religious education , geography , music and art . these subjects are the best represented by teachers who are active in emu , have attended courses or have been appointed as coordinators members of physical education departments are the most involved in cross - community contact activities although relatively few have been appointed as co - ordinators or have attended courses most schools saw emu being developed successfully by individuals within the school , supported at a second level by a small group of committed teachers respondents did not think it very likely that all teachers will become active in developing emu training prior to education reform the bulk of pump - priming resources associated with emu went into providing substitute teacher cover for cross - community contact rather than training for teachers one consequence of education reform is that less training specific to emu may be available for teachers in the short term teachers who have been appointed as emu co - ordinators by schools need some immediate support to decide how best to initiate school - based training and development within their own school teachers are not confident that they have the necessary skills to handle the community relations aspects of emu evaluation evaluation of the long - term impact of emu is not regarded as a high priority within the formal education system teachers are more preoccupied with evaluation in terms of assessment procedures and how these will measure pupil progress in the main curriculum subjects individuals within the system are suspicious of monitoring ' or ' measuring ' changes in pupil attitudes in terms of community relations throughout the system there is no clear picture of what techniques would be appropriate to support evaluation return to publication contents chapter eight : recommendations the following recommendations are offered as starting points for discussion as education for mutual understanding makes the important transition from a voluntary to a statutory feature of the curriculum in schools in northern ireland . 1 . clarify the conceptual framework of emu this research has indicated that there is a range of perceptions of emu and that these are often the result of personal interpretation . within the education system , there is a need to generate a shared understanding of what emu represents as a cross curricular theme . this can only emerge from discussion and debate between the many statutory and voluntary organisations concerned with emu . in particular , it will be important to put the ' community relations ' and ' cross - community contact ' aspects of emu into perspective alongside other dimensions . the northern ireland curriculum council may have a role in producing guidance material for schools based on the conceptual framework for emu which emerges from such discussion . 2 . seek better co - ordination between agencies improved co - ordination between agencies on emu - related issues would provide a focus for development and encourage consistency of approach . this could happen in three possible ways : greater commitment from individuals within the emu network to informal co - operation between agencies . no obvious catalyst to encourage this has emerged and this approach is more likely to result in a network of statutory agencies and a network of voluntary agencies . more formal co - operation on a number of defined projects such as production of resources or training initiatives . the department may have a catalytic role by funding clearly defined initiatives of this type and support from the chief executives of education and library boards would be especially important . establish a more formal structure . potential co - ordinating structures exist within the youth service ( youth council ) and broader community initiatives ( community relations council ) and provide a focus for community relations work in these spheres . no equivalent structure exists in relation to community relations work through schools . 3 . in the long term , consider devolving responsibility for funding there is resentment within schools that emu is ' imposed by government ' and this perception is reinforced by central administration of funds for community relations aspects of the work . a greater sense of ownership might be encouraged by devolving responsibilities for funding to a broader base of representative interests within the education system . 4 . consider whether a body with specific responsibility to support the community relations work of schools should be funded or newly established there will always be some tension between the more universal dimensions of emu and specific activities to promote better community relations . if there are concerns that the community relations issues will become ' lost ' , avoided or neglected within the broader dimensions of emu then one possibility is to create or fund a body with specific responsibility to provide a focus for community relations work within and between schools . 5 . review criteria applied by the contact scheme whatever decisions are made about administration and structure it would be worth considering a review of the criteria which apply to the contact scheme . there are a number of reasons for this . in particular there are schools which may wish to participate but have difficulties in fulfilling the criteria for contact for demographic or other reasons . broader criteria could support such schools . it is also worth considering how the scheme might support teachers developing novel approaches within schools and how good quality work can be developed in non - contact settings . the development of materials relevant to the local situation is another example . it may not be possible to amend the criteria for the contact scheme , in which case the community relations branch of the department of education might consider establishing an alternative scheme which can respond to such needs . 6 . support aspects of practice which seem to work well despite emu being new to the formal ni curriculum there is a considerable reservoir of practical experience within the system . it would seem sensible to build on this by augmenting support for aspects of practice which teachers have found to be important . two aspects were identified by a number of respondents as part of this research : opportunities for planning and contact between teachers one of the main benefits of work between schools has been the contact it affords between teachers this seems not only to have benefit for the teachers but to lead to more coherent and enjoyable experiences for pupils involved in the joint project . this tallies with the view that teachers ' perceptions of emu are related to their own biographies and that commitment to ' good quality ' work with pupils follows naturally where teachers have had an opportunity to explore their own attitudes to the issues involved . experiences of contact in a residential context despite some scepticism about the value of some contact experiences teachers generally comment favourably on the value of residential work . ways should be found to build upon this . one option is that every child in northern ireland should have an entitlement to voluntary participation in at least one cross - community residential experience per year . the level of funding this would require , and whether there is an infrastructure of residential centres to support it , would need to be explored . 7 . encourage innovative schemes the formal education system is often accused of being conservative yet the infancy of emu within the ni curriculum suggests that innovative and imaginative ideas are possible . an example which was encountered as part of this research is the suggestion of a scheme to support teachers from controlled and maintained schools who wish to spend some time experiencing the environment in a different type of school . however , it appears to be more straightforward to arrange an exchange with a school in another country than to spend time in a different type of school in northern ireland . the idea may be contentious in some quarters but schools would benefit from the insight which a visiting teacher may give about the way the institution appears to someone from a different cultural tradition . 8 . give priority to training for teachers emu did not have the benefit of ' pump - priming ' investment in training for teachers which other educational themes , such as information technology , health education and economic awareness , had prior to education reform . there are a number of practical possibilities which may help make up lost ground : in the short term , fund the development of support materials for co - ordinators and teachers involved in school - based training on emu . this could be developed with a commitment from the chief executives of education and library boards , possibly with support from the regional training unit and/or the northern ireland curriculum council . in the longer term , look at ways of strengthening opportunities for training in emu through preservice and in - service teacher education , including the role of award - bearing courses and voluntary agencies in providing some of this . 9 . initiate longitudinal evaluative studies although teachers may have a contribution to evaluating emu 's impact there is still room for observer - based studies . these could be anthropological - type studies of school experience of emu over a long period . the value and practical problems of conducting ' social attitude ' type studies involving the pupil population would be more contentious . given the expectation that the impact of emu is only likely to become apparent over a long period of time , some thought needs to be given to a long - term research and evaluation strategy . return to publication contents � centre for the study of conflict and the author(s ) last modified by martin melaugh : back to the top of this page_nn _ _ when you visit our web site : we will not collect any personal information about you of any kind . we will not require you to register in order to visit any part of the site . we do not use cookies . when you contact us to enquire about our services : we ask you to identify yourself ( preferably with your name and that of your organisation ) so that we can give you a personal response . if you are enquiring about on -

to languidly for just the necessary time till they were out of sight . ' i 'm not breaking my heart with it , ' he remarked . once there was a hatch to be opened near where he was stationed ; he watched the preparations for a second or so suspiciously , and then , ' hullo , ' said he , ' here 's some real work coming -- i'm off , ' and he was gone that moment . again , calculating the six guinea passage- money , and the probable duration of the passage , he remarked pleasantly that he was getting six shillings a day for this job , ' and it 's pretty dear to the company at that . ' ' they are making nothing by me , ' was another of his observations ; ' they 're making something by that fellow . ' and he pointed to the devonian , who was just then busy to the eyes . the more you saw of alick , the more , it must be owned , you learned to despise him . his natural talents were of no use either to himself or others ; for his character had degenerated like his face , and become pulpy and pretentious . even his power of persuasion , which was certainly very surprising , stood in some danger of being lost or neutralised by over - confidence . he lied in an aggressive , brazen manner , like a pert criminal in the dock ; and he was so vain of his own cleverness that he could not refrain from boasting , ten minutes after , of the very trick by which he had deceived you . ' why , now i have more money than when i came on board , ' he said one night , exhibiting a sixpence , ' and yet i stood myself a bottle of beer before i went to bed yesterday . and as for tobacco , i have fifteen sticks of it . ' that was fairly successful indeed ; yet a man of his superiority , and with a less obtrusive policy , might , who knows ? have got the length of half a crown . a man who prides himself upon persuasion should learn the persuasive faculty of silence , above all as to his own misdeeds . it is only in the farce and for dramatic purposes that scapin enlarges on his peculiar talents to the world at large . scapin is perhaps a good name for this clever , unfortunate alick ; for at the bottom of all his misconduct there was a guiding sense of humour that moved you to forgive him . it was more than half a jest that he conducted his existence . ' oh , man , ' he said to me once with unusual emotion , like a man thinking of his mistress , ' i would give up anything for a lark . ' it was in relation to his fellow - stowaway that alick showed the best , or perhaps i should say the only good , points of his nature . ' mind you , ' he said suddenly , changing his tone , ' mind you that 's a good boy . he would n't tell you a lie . a lot of them think he is a scamp because his clothes are ragged , but he is n't ; he 's as good as gold . ' to hear him , you become aware that alick himself had a taste for virtue . he thought his own idleness and the other 's industry equally becoming . he was no more anxious to insure his own reputation as a liar than to uphold the truthfulness of his companion ; and he seemed unaware of what was incongruous in his attitude , and was plainly sincere in both characters . it was not surprising that he should take an interest in the devonian , for the lad worshipped and served him in love and wonder . busy as he was , he would find time to warn alick of an approaching officer , or even to tell him that the coast was clear , and he might slip off and smoke a pipe in safety .

" wild cards " ( truncation ) if you are searching for summaries about arteries , you may want to look for similar words such as artery , arteries , arterial . you could look for each term individually . a quicker way would be to use " wild cards " ( also called " truncation " ) . type an asterisk ( * ) after the first few letters of a word to find any word beginning with those letters . so , searching for : arter * finds summaries with any of the words artery , arteries , arterial . you can also truncate within phrases when searching . this applies the truncation to all words within the phrase . for example , searching for : " co arter * " will find summaries containing the phrases coronary artery or coronary arteries , etc . it would also find a summary with the sentence these include systemic blood pressure , but also haemoglobin concentration , arterial oxygen tension and oxygen saturation because the phrase concentration , arterial appears within it and punctuation marks are ignored . combining search terms a ) using the search box on the left hand side the search engine will look for summaries with all the words and phrases entered in the search box appearing anywhere in the summary 's text fields . so , searching for : hip knee will find summaries with both the words hip and knee . b ) using the advanced search options box use the drop - down menu to choose whether the search engine looks for summaries with all or any of the words and phrases entered in the search box . c ) using the " free - style " search you can use special words ( known as " boolean operators " ) to combine search terms in specific ways . there are three of these " operators " : or : use or between search terms to find summaries containing any of those terms . so , searching for : aspirin or paracetamol or " pain killer " finds summaries containing the word aspirin or the word paracetamol or the phrase pain killer . and : use and between search terms to find summaries containing all of those terms . so , searching for : " chest pain " and aspirin and " beta block * " will only find summaries that contain the phrase chest pain and also contain the word aspirin and also contain the ( truncated ) phrase beta block * ( such as beta blockers ) . not : use not between two search terms to find summaries containing the first term but not the second term . so , searching for : ulcer not stomach finds summaries containing the word ulcer without the word stomach . using parentheses : the three operators can be combined in a single search , but make sure you put parentheses around each component of the search so that terms are combined in the order you intended . for example , if you want to find summaries referring to chest pain and also either aspirin or beta blockers , you should search for : " chest pain " and ( aspirin or " beta blockers " ) if you omit the parentheses , and enter the following search : " chest pain " and aspirin or " beta blockers " you will retrieve summaries referring to either both of chest pain and aspirin or alternatively summaries referring to beta blockers . restricting searches to specific sections ( fields ) you can restrict a search so that you only retrieve summaries where terms appear in certain parts ( " fields " ) of a summary as follows : a ) using the advanced search options box use the drop -

down in bundles indoors or out in a sheltered but well ventilated place that is not too cold . i have perspex over what used to be an old yard and i hang the herbs and old flowers from vases , that have died , from hooks there . you can also use slatted wooden racks . traditionally metal was not used either for cutting or drying herbs because of the dislike nature essences have for iron , but in practice metal cake cooling trays are excellent for drying herbs microwaves can be used in a hurry but micro dried herbs are not so fragrant . in the summer or fine weather herbs dry very quickly - they should be crumbly if pressed but still fragrant . keep the dried herbs in labelled glass jars ( cookware ones are excellent with lids or stoppers ) . making and burning your own incense the tools : a heatproof dish , preferably with a heatproof lip you can carry it by . unglazed pottery ones are good , and on sale very cheaply . be careful with metal dishes as they get hot . but you can buy the kind with a lid and chain to hold , i used to hate those but have now realised you can use them quite safely and it is rather good to be able to use incense outdoors , even if it is windy , by swinging the smoke in the covered censer . you need only a small incense burner and they cost no more than a few pounds from an new age store or on the internet . the burner is often called a thurible or censer ( the kind you swing ) . charcoal discs . charcoal is considered a gift from mother earth and was used frequently in the native north american world . its colour is a natural absorber of negative energies and as it forms ash so the redundant is transformed into fire energy . the easiest charcoal to work with initially is an individual disc about the size of a very large coin . this will have an indentation in the centre on which you can scatter your petals or herbs . these are really small and fit on the incense dish . buy reasonable quality ones and keep the packet sealed so the charcoal does not get damp . you can also sprinkle a little incense on barbecue coals or any open fire , though not while cooking . tongs , either metal ones form a hardware store or barbecue ones for holding the charcoal while you light it . long cook 's matches or a taper lit from a candle are best . you can use a long cigarette lighter if you are careful , but i always burn myself . a small metal spoon for scooping the herbs on to the charcoal . sometimes you can buy at a garage sale or cookware shop what are called sugar spoons , much smaller than a teaspoon . the mixing first mix your herbs and flowers using the meanings below and from elsewhere on the site in a mortar and pestle or bowl . you can choose as many or few herbs as you wish . you must include at least one resin . i sometime use as little as a quarter of the total mix as resin , but the more resin you use the more intensely and longer the mix burns . experiment with just a resin , say frankincense and then on another occasion just a pure herb , such as rosemary and in between the two you will find the right proportions for you . for this reason too , when in future i suggest mixes , then i will leave you to decide the proportions ( see below for resin list ) as you mix , chant the purpose of the incense , either faster and faster till you finish with a final call of , for example , lavender lavender bring me love or with more than one herb in the mix , for example cinnamon , basil , mint , you herbs three , bring i ask money fast to me . ' if the incense is for healing or to banish or protect when you have mixed and chanted as fast as you can , reduce the chant and speed of mixing till you are still and silent . light the charcoal disc . the very easiest way to ignite a disc is to light a long cook 's match or taper . pick up your charcoal in tongs , so it is on its side between the tongs and light over the censer or dish . light one edge of the charcoal tablet and blow very gently till you see the red glow starting to spread across the charcoal . when the charcoal begins to glow place it in the censer and continue to blow gently if you want to get moving fast . you can whisper the purpose of the incense as just before each blow it is sometimes hard to tell if charcoal is alight initially as it may still look dull , so do not touch it as it will be extremely hot even if it has gone out . the block will slowly turn greyish white - this is white heat . once the charcoal is glowing you can stop blowing and perhaps begin your ritual or simply focus on the purpose you have in mind . when the charcoal is white hot , drop just a little of the mix at first in the centre of the disc , adding grains gradually as part of the ritual . experiment with open and lidded censers . the latter need less topping up but there is something magical about sitting outdoors with your little open burner against the sunset , chanting or singing softly and adding more herbs as the intensity of the ritual increases ._. _ _ become a member to your favourite gadget site and enjoy in a huge list of features and benefits from just � 2.50 a month : ad free content view all the pages on pocket - lint faster and without the distraction of adverts such as pop ups , pop unders , banners , and mpus news and reviews alerts pocket - lint.co.uk news and reviews alert service emails you all the latest news and reviews on a specified subject or company as it happens . geekfriend got a gadget question but do n't know the answer ?

" all of us like really non - commercial music " , he explains , " going from really strange jazz to psychedelic funk or old , noisy shoegazer kind of music and heavy rock . " the result is strangely sugary : " a lot of people have been coming up to us saying , " so who got you together ? you sound a bit manufactured , are you from some danish pop contest or something ? " what we do obviously has some commercial appeal , which none of us regret . " nu are n't a superficial act by any stretch of the imagination . sure , they have definite commercial appeal through throbbing infectious choruses and frontwoman stine jacobsen 's looks , but the 11 tracks on their debut album ' alphabravoshockpopdisco ' are " classic songs with a lot of edge , swagger and sexiness to them " , not shallow europop - by - numbers . as a result , they 're bound to attract both guitar lovers and teenyboppers to their ranks . morten , lars iversen ( bass ) and peter iversen ( guitar ) are n't image - driven by any means . music is the be all and end all of nu 's quest for commercial recognition . but with the last minute addition of stine ( " at the point where we agreed to finish the collaboration with our previous singer , we nearly dropped the band " ) comes an obvious no doubt aesthetic comparison . no doubt have experienced the annoyance of having their frontwoman gain more attention than the music itself , so is morten prepared for a similar shift in press interest ? " it 's already happened dude ! when you have someone who 's so talented and has the looks of stine , you ca n't really avoid that . we just want to support her in what she will do and how she 'll play it . thankfully she 's a very clever girl and she understands the fact that she 's in a band , and she has to play the part of being in nu . she has all the possibilities to do what she wants to do after this , but that should n't be the focus right now , and it 's definitely not the focus of the band . it 's definitely not a problem for us , and whatever helps stine being in nu helps nu in general . " lyrically , ' alphabravoshockpopdisco ' has a few mature messages to relate beneath the musical gloss . america obviously causes a few ambiguous opinions in the band : ' san francisco ' claims " life 's a bitch in san francisco " , whilst ' are you havin' fun ' contains a negative portrayal of the american dream . topical criticisms perhaps ? " you 've got to sort of love it and hate it . most of us do n't really like the way they 're going on in the world , trying to be the big brother and if there 's a problem just sweep it out . but when you go there you ca n't avoid being fascinated by the history , the country , the lawlessness and the fact that it is definitely the land of opportunity . it 's not something we 're raving about but it might have been what inspired some of the lyrics . " then there 's the sentiment that ' disco hurts ' on the band 's debut single . so are the discos in denmark violent places then ? " you could get that impression , could n't you ! it 's more a fantasy story of this girl going to disco every night and realising that getting out , getting drunk , taking drugs , meeting guys all the time might not be so healthy . in some ways it 's an anti - disco song ; avoid the discoteque , read a book , sit on a lake at night time and have a spliff and chill out . " with important things to say and some riotous tunes to back them up , nu found the final piece of the jigsaw in producer michael patterson , whose credits include brmc and beck 's ' midnite vultures ' album . michael succeeded in creating a atmosphere of creative freedom . " he was n't the guy standing , screaming to take this chord instead of that chord , he was more of a guy saying " i think maybe this song should be 1 or 2 bpm faster " and " just do your best to play music and i 'll record you guys and we 'll take it from there " . he did n't have a strong presence , just made things happen , and he gets the best out of people .
