' � john white , december 4 th 2004 . white star memories , europe 's leading exhibition specialists on rms titanic and the white star line � it was worth the wait . ' � michael standart , december 29 th 2004 . � the rms olympic went to the assistance of the titanic , whose fate eclipsed its sister ship 's image . chirnside argues that the former was the most innovative british - built ocean liner of its time , with a mostly successful run of transatlantic crossings and troop transport . in this first comprehensive history spanning 1908 to 1935 , he corrects several misconceptions . illustrations include the ship 's amenities , deck plans , colourful cruise ads and souvenir postcards . appendices include what is believed to be its only profit and loss account , other statistics , and notes of a competing line 's � spy . � ' � � book news ' annotation , 2004 . powell 's books � a substantial new volume dealing with the life and times of olympic � it is a mystery as to why olympic has been previously neglected by maritime historians . how impressive it is that this omission has been so effectively redressed by mark chirnside � ' � maritime journal , emsworth , hantshire , january 2005 . � your olympic book is a marvellous read - and - re - read !

' � evan meyerriecks , december 27 th 2005 . webmaster : ship magnificent - the rms olympic � titanic 's elder sister , rms olympic , plays the cinderella role in the history of the white star line , overshadowed as she is by titanic . a book concentrating at length on olympic is long overdue � but , boy , was it worth the wait ! � mark chirnside writes with great authority , has a painstaking eye for detail and colour and draws on a vast array of sources to bring to life the ship 's romantic grandeur , state of the art technology and popularity with the sailing public . � he charts her long and fascinating career , vividly exploring her days as a millionaires ' playground , her stint as a troop ship , her ramming of a german u boat and her accidental slicing - through of the nantucket lightship at the close of her commercial life . � the book is peppered with numerous crisp black and white photographs ( many which i have never seen ) and a series of colour plates . mr chirnside 's highly readable style kept me absorbed and frequently transported me back to the heady days when ocean going liners so completely caught the public imagination . � why this elegant edwardian ship , almost identical to her ill - fated sisters titanic & britannic , was allowed to meet an ignominious end at the breaker 's yard in jarrow in 1936 leaves me puzzled and saddened ; her grandeur only now recalled in the pieces of her exquisite panelling gracing a north country hotel . a sad end to a wonderful queen of the ocean and a tale brilliantly told by mark chirnside in a book i can not praise too highly . � if you 're interested in the white star line 's � olympic � class ships , dispel any hesitation from your minds . this is a book to read , re - read and always treasure . first class !

' � nick thearle , april 5 th 2006 . grandson of chief engineer john thearle . author 's note one of the highlights of this book is the glossy , colour section in the middle , which includes a number of rare and unpublished images , including arthur lismer 's 1919 painting of the olympic at halifax . also included is a set of 1931 deck plans , showing much of the first class accommodation , and colour - coded to show the various levels of amenities in first class . there are also a large number of black and white photos in the book . many of the photos are rare , and unpublished in a book before � these include a photo of canadian soldiers on olympic 's bridge front , and a wonderfully atmospheric image of the liner departing halifax in 1916 , not to mention the troops being waved off in a 1919 photo . a vast amount of historical material is published here for the first time , including a number of diaries relating the story of a number of wartime adventures , to new information on a host of events that occurred during olympic 's life , such as the hawke collision in 1911 which � perhaps fatally � delayed titanic 's maiden voyage , the sinking of the u103 in 1918 , the fort st george collision of 1924 and the nantucket lightship collision in summer 1934 . with a listing of olympic 's passenger carryings from 1911 to 1935 , not to mention hitherto unpublished details of her financial operation , and a mass of unpublished information on her service life , i have been told that the book is considered the most detailed yet published on the history of the royal mail steamship olympic . it is a tremendous compliment . readers with any documented corrections are invited to contact me in the hope that mistakes can be rectified in any future editions . purchase rms olympic : titanic 's sister - mark chirnside - tempus publishing ths - rms olympic , titanic 's sister ths - 166 . the titanic commutator i regularly sell signed copies of the book on ebay , personalised to your choice . if you wish me to put up an auction listing so that you can buy a copy , please do n't hesitate to let me know via my e - mail address on the main page ._. _ _ researching social policy : the use of qualitative methods increasingly , authorities are being expected to develop policies and provide services that take account of the public 's needs and wishes . here , alan hedges , independent research consultant and a spokesperson for the association for qualitative research , and sue duncan , director - strategy unit , cabinet office , look at the social policy role of qualitative research , based mainly on group discussion techniques . introduction government now recognises not only that the public dislikes being excluded from policy - making , but that things usually work better if people are involved in policy development . there is growing insistence that policy should be based where possible on evidence and not on assumption . a climate of rising expectations coupled with resource constraints has increased the need for effective and carefully targeted policies and has led local authorities and other public bodies to the gradual realisation that thorough research can assist with this . understanding the public in this environment it is clearly increasingly crucial that public bodies should understand their public . that means understanding in depth not only people 's attitudes , beliefs and feelings , but also why they behave as they do . one point is becoming increasingly clear - policies do not work well if the public does not understand what is supposed to happen , and if the culture is pulling people in the opposite direction . it is in the arena of public understanding that the impact of consultation on policy making is most keenly felt . as the policies of government departments and other public sector bodies often hinge on complex issues , the public often has a very incomplete understanding of what happens , and there are sometimes significant misconceptions - which may be important to clear up in sounding out opinion about future options . for example , a major policy initiative , such as the new deal introduced in the late 1990s , raises issues about the values and behaviours that underpin the policy and about how such a major reform can be successfully implemented . the research programme involved an examination of the attitudes , knowledge and motivations of different types of jobseekers ( bearing in mind that the situation of a 24-year - old lone parent woman is very different to that of a 40-year - old long - term unemployed man ) ; and the barriers and triggers which determine whether and how someone will seek work . apart from the complexity of the issues , public bodies also have to grapple with the essential complexity of human beings , who have a great capacity for ambivalence and inconsistency . while there will be some topics on which members of the public have strong and considered views , there will be many more about which they need to reflect , learn about what options there might be , and feel their way to a conclusion . qualitative research is good at dealing with such issues as it does not have to seek single answers to questions . ' knee - jerk solutions ' moreover , it is unsatisfactory to base policy on ' knee - jerk ' responses . people can express views on issues they do not know much about and have not thought through properly - but they would not necessarily like the outcome of policies based on such shallow foundations . the modernising government white paper spoke about an ' outcome - focused culture ' - only considered , informed and matured opinions are likely to provide a basis for the kind of long - term satisfaction this implies . qualitative research facilitates high quality dialogue with the public , and can provide a sensitive tool for informing as well as collecting information . it can also give people space to deliberate on the issues under study , and to mature their opinions . in order to seek these more considered views , there is a spectrum of models that public bodies can apply to the way they use research techniques . these include the following set out in the table below:- model behaviour market research model : the organisation wants to find out more about the attitudes , aspirations and activities of the people it serves , but it still wants to determine the agenda and take the decisions consultative model : the organisation wants to know what people would like it to do , but still takes the final decisions participative model : the organisation wants to work with people and involve them in decision - making delegation model : the organisation wants to let people make their own decisions . there is scope for operating at all these levels , and the appropriate model will vary between policy fields . however , over time the focus has tended to move down the scale . the modernising government white paper gave a further push in this direction when it said , ' rather than imposing solutions we must consult and work with people . ' the past 25 years have witnessed a massive growth in qualitative research for the public sector , which has realised the value in harnessing the insight it provides for a range of purposes - developing , evaluating implementing and communicating policy . the benefits of qualitative research in this context are many . it allows public bodies to understand a variety of complex matters . how is existing policy understood , perceived and experienced ? how successful is it seen to be ? what is thought to need improving or changing ? it also provides insight into the values and goals of the target public , and their needs , concerns and problems . additionally , qualitative research can help public bodies to understand which options for future policy people favour , and why , and also what are the likely barriers to successful policy implementation and the conditions necessary to its success . emergency policy issues qualitative research can also help policy - makers to understand emergent policy issues - for example , statistical evidence may show a growth in claims for disability benefits , but it will rarely throw much light on why this is happening . research can untangle what is going on - which greatly helps in formulating effective solutions . it can also get the public to look at alternative policy options , at different ways forward . equally , qualitative research can help to assist in monitoring and evaluating a new policy , although it is likely to be teamed with an element of quantitative research . the qualitative component has a particular role in evaluation because it can increase understanding - not only of what is happening , but also of why . the ultimate aim of evaluation is to assess whether a policy is achieving its objectives , both through its implementation and its content . a policy could fall at either of these hurdles and it is important to know which , because in the latter case it is the policy itself which needs to change , whereas in the former case it just needs to be differently executed . communications as far as communications is concerned , qualitative research is particularly good at helping local authorities and public bodies to develop ways of communicating policy effectively . this can be important both for the proper functioning of the system and from the perspective of public accountability . amongst the key issues which need to be considered are : what do people know and understand ? what do they want to know ? how much information do they want , and how much can they cope with ? how do they interpret what they are told ? what kinds of message will influence behaviour ? how can meaning be conveyed simply and effectively ? what are the key points to get across ? from examining progress to date , there is no doubt that qualitative research can play an important role in helping public bodies develop and implement effective policies . in a climate that demands increasing levels of public accountability its value should not go unrecognised by bodies needing and wanting to show a greater awareness of public needs and desires . this article first featured in the july / august issue of local government news and we are grateful to the publishers of lgn for their permission to publish on policy hub . this feature is based on a chapter from ' qualitative research in context ' published in conjunction with the association for qualitative research ( aqr ) . policy hub , hm treasury , g.38 , 1 horse guards road , london sw1a 2hq [ crown copyright ] [ privacy policy ] [ disclaimer ] [ complaints procedure ] [_-lrb- _ _ disabilty activities the sports development service offers a number of different and exciting activities for people with disabilities . these take place all year round at venues across the city . activities offered include : trampolining mutli - sports horseriding tennis golf rowing swimming football tag rugby fitness classes sports zone holiday activities you can download the latest disability sport focus group newsletter pdf ( 696 kb ) . the newsletter contains information about the different activities on offer for children and adults , the latest news about the focus groups activities and you have an opportunity to have your say . you can send in a booking form to the office to book on to the disability activities . places on courses are limited and it is advised to phone the office first to check if places are available . you can download the disability sport booking form pdf ( 68 kb ) . please see the contact us section for the sports development service address . the disability sport focus group in partnership with cambridge city council and south cambridgeshire district council sports development services organises the annual disability sports festival . the 2006 event takes place on sunday 14th may at sawston sports centre . you can download this year 's poster pdf ( 383 kb ) . the festival will provided opportunities for adults and children with disabilities , and family and friends to try various sports and activities including archery , golf , kite buggying , rollerblading , rowing , canoeing , climbing , and trampolining amongst many others . why not become a member of the disability sports focus group ?

" it 's a bad job -- a very bad job , " said west , with a sigh , as he mounted one of the pair of very excellent ponies that had been provided for the despatch - riders by the gallant chief in command at mafeking , with the laughing comment that the two brave little animals ought to consider themselves very lucky in being provided with two such masters , who would take them right away from the beleaguered town , where , if they stayed , their fate was bound to be that they would be minced into sausages or boiled down into soup . they were two beautiful little beasts ; but west always sighed and said it was a bad job whenever he mounted , for his heart was sore about the pony he had lost before they entered mafeking . " i say , young fellow , " said ingleborough , with one of his grim smiles : " how much longer are you going to stay in mourning ? " " stay in mourning ? " said west , staring , as he bent forward to pat his mount 's back . " yes : for those two ponies we lost ; because it seems to me very absurd ! to begin with , it 's downright folly to bemoan the loss of one pony when you have been provided with another equally good ; secondly , it is more absurd to bemoan a pony at all ; and thirdly , it is the most absurd thing of all to be mourning for one that in all probability is not dead . " " oh , they 're both dead enough by this time ! " said west bitterly . " mine may be , for it was hit ; but from the way it reared up and kicked out it had no bones broken , and these basuto ponies are such hardy little beasts that i daresay it got better ; while yours was so good that you may depend upon it some boer has it nipped tightly between his legs , and is making the most of it . " " i hope you are right ! " said west . " and there , i will not mourn for them , as you call it , any more , but make the best of things . let 's see ; this is the sixth day out from mafeking . " " seventh , " said ingleborough correctively . " of course ; so it is , but i lose count through being so intent upon the one idea of getting back to kimberley . do you think we shall manage to get through the boer lines ? " " think ? why , we 've got to get through them . we should n't be long if we could only ride straight away , and not be always running right on to some fresh party who begin to make game of us directly . " " that 's rather an ambiguous way of speaking , ingle , " said west , laughing , as he caressed his pony . " if anybody else heard you he would think you meant that the boers bantered and chaffed us . " " but nobody else does hear us , and you think that i mean that they begin to pump out bullets at us just as if we were a pair of springboks . i say , i 'm beginning to think that we are leading a charmed life , for it is wonderful what escapes we have had from their long - carrying rifles . " " i 'm beginning to think in a much more matter - of - fact way , " replied west ; " and i think this , that five hundred yards ' range is quite long enough for any rifle used on active service . i know that when one takes aim beyond that distance one is very doubtful of hitting . " " i feel so after half that distance , " replied ingleborough , and then : " hullo ! see something ? " " yes ; i thought we were going to have a good long ride in peace this morning , but look yonder ! " the two young men drew rein and leaped to the ground , each hurriedly getting out his glass , for the commandant at mafeking had supplied them with fresh ones , to steady it by resting it upon the saddle he had just quitted , their well - trained ponies standing perfectly motionless . " what do you make of it ? " said ingleborough , scanning a mistily - seen dark line right away beneath the sun . " wagons trekking , " replied west quietly . " friends ? " " who can say ? i think not . reinforcements and stores on the way to the besiegers , i should think . " " i 'm afraid you are right ! well , we had better let the nags feed while we lie down and watch , for i do n't think they have seen us yet . " " very well , " said west . " i 'm tired of so much running away ! " the next minute they were lying amongst some stones and their ponies grazing , ingleborough coolly filling his pipe and lighting it with a burning - glass , but keeping a watchful eye upon the long train of wagons and horsemen plodding along at the customary rate of about two miles an hour , and ready at any moment to spring upon his pony in case a party of the enemy should make up their minds to try and drive in the two ponies when they caught their eye . this he knew was doubtful , for it was beginning to be a common sight upon the veldt -- that of a wounded or worn - out horse or two picking up a scanty living from the grass and green points of the shrubs , while an investigation generally proved that the poor brutes were not worth the trouble of the ride . still , on the other hand , the suspicious nature of the boers might prompt them to see whether riders were near the grazing animals , and an opportunity for capturing a prisoner or two be theirs . the pair kept a keen look - out ; but it seemed for a long time that they were to be left in peace , the long line of wagons and horsemen plodding steadily onward , completely blocking the way the bearers of the kimberley despatch had to take . at last , though , just after west had expressed his opinion that the boers were too intent upon getting their heavy guns on towards mafeking , ingleborough , unnoticed by his companion , made a sudden movement , dropping his pipe and altering the small lenses of his field - glass , through which he lay gazing , supporting himself upon his elbows . " hah ! " said west , who was similarly occupied ; " they 've got four heavy guns and a tremendous lot of stores . would n't one of our generals give something to have his men so arranged that he could cut them off in all directions ! the country is so open , and not a kopje in sight . what a prize those guns would be ! " " yes , " said ingleborough sharply ; " but there is no british force at hand , so they are going to surround us instead . " " what ! " cried west excitedly . " that they are , and no mistake ! " continued ingleborough , slewing himself round so as to look in a different direction . " you do n't mean -- oh , ingle ! three strong bodies coming from behind , north and south . why , we 're trapped ! " " we are , my lad ; for here they come from the front . " west turned his glass again in the direction of the long line of wagons after his look round , to see that a party of the boers were riding out straight for them . " trapped ; but we must dodge between the wires , eh ? " cried west , who , like his companion , had made at once for where his pony was grazing . " hah ! look out , ingle ! " ingleborough was looking out , but left helpless . west had caught his pony , but his companion had startled the other by the suddenness of his approach , and , throwing up its head , the little animal cantered off with his rider after him . " stop , stop ! " shouted west . " you only scare the brute more . " " right ! " said ingleborough sadly , and he stopped short and began to return . " there ! " he cried , as west sprang into his saddle ; " you have the despatch . off with you through that opening ! i wo n't hinder you ! i 'll turn prisoner again for a change . " " lay hold of my pony 's tail and run ! i 'll keep him to a canter , and change with you as soon as you 're tired ! " said west , scanning the opening between the end of the boer line and the party of horsemen away to his left who were making straight for them , lying towards the middle of the line , where the big guns were being dragged along . " no good ! " said ingleborough . " off with you , and save your despatch ! " " ca n't leave you , old fellow ! do as i tell you ! " cried west . " hook on ! " " i will not ! they wo n't kill me if i throw up my hands ! save your despatch if you can ! " " obey orders , sir ! " roared west fiercely , " and do n't waste time ! i 'm going to trot after your mount , and he 'll join us . " " hah ! bravo , sharp brains ! " cried ingleborough excitedly , and twisting the long thick hair of the pony 's tail about his left hand he ran lightly after his companion , the pony west rode uttering a shrill neigh as they went off , which made the other stop , cock up its ears , answer , and come galloping after them , so eager to join its fellow that it brushed close past ingleborough , who caught the rein without trouble . " right ! " he shouted , and the next minute he was in the saddle , with the ponies cantering along side by side . " more to the left ! " cried west . " the boers are bearing away to cut us off ! " this was plain enough , and the fugitives saw that if a fresh party started from the end of the long line they were bound to be cut off . " never mind , " cried ingleborough ; " we may get away ! those fellows are quite a mile from us , and their mounts will be pumped out if they push forward like that . easy , easy ! let the ponies go their own pace ! " settling down into a canter , the fugitives now began to look away to their left , where they had seen the other parties closing them in from their flank and rear . " hallo ! where 's the rest of the enemy ? " cried west . " yonder , out of sight ! the ground lies lower there ; but i say , these fellows are coming on at a tremendous rate ! gallop or they 'll cut you off . " " then we 'll gallop ! " cried west . " we , old fellow ! just as if i were going to leave you behind ! " " very nice of you , " said ingleborough merrily ; " but you 're not fit for a despatch - rider . you 're about the worst i ever knew of ! " " because i wo n't forsake a friend ? " " friend be hanged ! there 's no friendship in wartime . ah , here come some of the flankers . " " yes , i see them , " said west ; " but what does this mean ? " for all at once the galloping party on their right -- that which had come straight from the centre of the boer line -- began to pull up until all were halted in the middle of the plain . " they see their companions coming , " said ingleborough , " and that we are safely cut off . well , it is giving us a better chance ! " " but they 're turning and folding back , " cried west excitedly . " here come the others , full gallop ! look , look , how they 're opening out ! gallop full speed now ! no , no . look , look ! why , ingle , those are not rifles they 're carrying -- they're lances . " " you 're dreaming ! " growled ingleborough . " never mind what they 're carrying ; they 're going to cut us off , and we 've got to save that despatch ! " " and we shall save it too ! " cried west , his voice sounding full of exultation . " those are our lancers -- a regiment of them ! " " you 're right ! " cried ingleborough excitedly now , and he began to draw rein . " look at the boer line . there 's proof ! they 're turning back from the front and hurrying up their rear so as to form laager round their big guns . hurrah ! " he yelled , rising in his stirrups to wave his hat . " and hurrah a hundred times more ! " yelled west , following his companion 's example , as he saw now in no less than four directions little clouds of horsemen moving over the widely - spreading plain . the next minute they had their glasses out and were watching the boers -- a line no longer , but broken up into what at first seemed to be wild confusion , out of which order began to form , for whoever was in command of the reinforcements on their way to mafeking possessed enough soldierly knowledge of what was the best thing to be done under the circumstances . as the wagons in front were wheeled round to retire upon the centre formed by the four heavy guns , and those from the rear were hurried up to join in making a great square , cloud after cloud of mounted men galloped forward to seize upon any patch of shelter to hold against the advancing british force . " it 's well meant , " said ingleborough , without taking his eyes from his glass ; " but they will not have time to form a strong laager . why , our men will be among them before a quarter of an hour is past . " " before ten minutes ! " cried west , in wild excitement . " hurrah ! trapped this time ! look right across the laager ; there are men coming on there ! " it was so , and ingleborough cheered wildly again . for the british general must have had abundant information of the coming convoy , and had taken his precautions and made his plans so accurately as to timing the advance that he had completely surrounded the long line with cavalry and mounted infantry , who now raced for the laager , heedless of the fire opened upon them by the boers . the enemy only fired a few shots , and then , finding themselves taken in front , flank , and rear , made for their horses and took flight in every direction , but not before the lancers got among them and dotted the veldt with horse and man . the boer commander and those with gun and wagon worked well , bringing their heavy guns to bear on the main advance ; but they were not directed at masses of men in column or line , but at a cloud of cavalry covering the plain and mingled with the enemy 's own flying horse , so that before a second discharge could be belched forth from the two large guns which were re - loaded , the lancers , hussars , and volunteer light horse were among the gunners , and it was every man for himself , sauve qui peut . west and ingleborough were so intent with their glasses , watching the utter rout of the boers , that they did not see a body of lancers bearing down upon them at a gallop , and the noise of the scattered firing kept up by the boers drowned the trampling of hoofs , till there was a shout which made the two despatch - bearers start round in their saddles , to see a dozen sun - browned , dust - covered lancers galloping at them with weapons levelled , headed by a young officer waving them on with his flashing sword . " up hands ! " yelled ingleborough , and glass and hat were thrust on high . it was only just in time , the officer raising his sword as he reined up by west and caught his arm . " hallo ! " he roared , as his men surrounded the pair with lances at their breasts ; " who are you ? " " despatch - riders -- mafeking to kimberley , " cried west . " where are your despatches then ? " cried the officer sharply . " here ! " cried west . " yah ! " cried the young officer . " i thought i 'd caught two boer generals directing the fight . what a jolly sell ! " " you 've got something better among you ! " said ingleborough , joining in the laugh which rose among the men . " have we ? what ? " " there are four heavy guns yonder , and a tremendous wagon train . " at that moment trumpet after trumpet rang out , and the men burst into a wild cheer , for the mounted boers were scattering in all directions , flying for their lives , and it was plain enough that a tremendous blow had been inflicted upon a very strong force , the capture of the convoy being complete , and those in charge who had not succeeded in reaching their horses readily throwing down their arms . " we 'll , we 've whipped ! " said the young officer of lancers , taking off his helmet to wipe his streaming face . " they ca n't find fault with us at home for this , my lads ! here , open out ; we must join in driving these ragged rascals back on the centre . here , you two , " he cried , turning to west and his companion , " i must take you both in to my chief , for i do n't know that i ought to take your bare word . " " well , i do n't think there 's much of the dopper about either of us . " " no , " said the officer , " but the boers have got the scum of europe and america with them , and you may be two little bits . " " want our rifles ? " said west coolly . " no ; but do n't try to bolt , either of you : it would be dangerous . my boys are rather handy with the lance ! " " so i see ! " said west , glancing at the points glistening at the tops of the bamboo shafts , several of which looked unpleasantly red . " and so i felt , " said ingleborough grimly , " for one of them pressed my ribs .

' in the history of the northwest coast there are tales of many powerful figures ; chiefs , warriors , and heroes , but the most elusive of these are the spiritual healers and leaders known as shamans . they were consulted to heal the sick , speak with spirits , expel witches and control the weather . often seen as strange and otherworldly , they lived on the border between the mortal and spirit worlds , constantly protected by their collections of amulets , charms and magical objects , the tools of their trade . ' ' the objects in this collection incorporate that mysterious imagery of transformation , ghosts , helping spirits , and of the powerful individuals who wielded their powers here so many years ago . today 's artists draw on the legacy of the shaman to create powerful and equisitely beautiful works in argillite , wood , silver , gold and shell . as well , glass trade beads , and 19th century copper bracelets draw a link to the past and remind us that personal ornamentation has always been a part of life on the northwest coast , even for us mere mortals !

' second only to the lord of the rings in the pantheon of 20th century english fantasy , the worm ourorobos was explicitly cited by tolkien as an inspiration . the worm ourorbos was originally published in a very limited and now very rare edition in 1922 ( a used first edition recently listed for $ 3,750 ) . eddison wrote three sequels set in roughly the same universe , but none of them have the sustained pacing and invention of ouroboros . ' ' before diving in , there are a few things to be aware of . the rich language eddison uses is based on tudor and jacobean english , with some modern anachronisms ; it may take some getting used to , and occasionally a trip to the unabridged oxford english dictionary . the narrator , one lessingham , who appears in a very brief framing sequence , disappears a few dozen pages in . the book is set on mercury ; however , keep in mind this is not science fiction , so this is not literally the planet mercury . eddison on several occasions in the body of the book calls the world ' middle earth ' , and the setting is recognizably the midgard of the norse myths and sagas , although for some unexplained reason the denizens worship the greek pantheon . the cast of characters , like tolkien , are principally masculine , with a couple of standout female leads ( who are actually better written than the women of tolkien ) . and lastly the various nationalities ( demons , witches , pixies , imps , etc . ) are not really separate species as in tolkien ; they are all essentially humans .

' 1920s : the decade that changed london . ' the 1920s began with london struggling to find its feet . the first world war had bankrupted the economy and had left people 's lives and beliefs shattered . by the end of the 1920s the mood had changed . london was looking to the future and coming to terms with such novelties as skyscrapers , ' talking pictures ' in the cinemas , robots , divorce , the bbc and labour government . londoners had more choices in their lives than ever before . ' ' the new london forged in the 1920s was a culturally diverse place plugged in to international ideas . from america came the joyous exuberance of jazz . from russia came ballet and bolshevism . from india and ireland came challenges to the old assumptions of the british empire .

'_'' _ _ southampton university men 's hockey club is experiencing a return to the form that saw them narrowly miss out on a place in the busa premiership two years ago . a blend of talented new freshers such as ed phippen and jamie cooke and wise old heads including skipper chris bennett , james calvet - jones and washed - up ex - international chris land has brought the first team a good set of results . playing in busa western 1a the 1st xi got off to a great start in their first four games , sweeping all before them . the first three fixtures were home matches against marjons , bath 2nds and uwe 1sts and saw wessex play some glorious hockey scoring 16 and conceding just three . the first away fixture of the season saw the 1st team travel to gloucester which included an overnight stay courtesy of charlie � spare tyre ' waters . this game proved to be much closer against a determined outfit , with wessex winning by the odd goal in seven . perhaps the highlight of this trip was a visit to the pit ' , gloucester 's version of jesters which saw some truly awesome dancing that won matt " twinkle toes " woolcott a bottle of champagne . the hangover seemed to drag on into the next week 's game , an epic encounter with league rivals cardiff . a ten goal thriller saw wessex lose out thanks to some sloppy defence and profligate finishing . these problems persisted into the next game which saw the 1sts make the long trip to plymouth to face marjons . the journey home seemed even longer after a disappointing performance saw them go down 3 - 1 to a side they had beaten 5 - 1 at home . a return visit from bath allowed the team to resume normal service , with five goals scored and only three conceded . the team now sit second in western 1a with three games to play . chris land is a notable force on the team , and has now scored 17 goals , with the team conceding only 18 in total . he will need to be on top form as the team need victory in their next two fixtures to set up a league decider with cardiff and a shot at the premiership playoffs . the newly promoted 2nd xi have also had a good season in a league where they were not expecting to prosper . chris yeo and richard warwick have masterfully led the team to five wins and a draw from their eight fixtures . this haul leaves them third in the league , just three points shy of second spot and the possibility of promotion . impressive victories came against exeter 2 - 1 and bournemouth 1sts 3 - 2 . however the sweetest victories are the home and away double over the solent 1st xi with an aggregate score of 11 - 7 . these results include a 7 - 4 thrashing at the solent 's ground proving that southampton really do have the dominance when it comes to the varsity rivalry . the 3rd and 4th xi 's have not been as strong as in previous years with both teams losing a lot of graduating players at the end of last year . last year the 3rd xi were relegated on goal difference and the 4th xi were promoted with the net result that both teams stayed in the same leagues . the 3rds started poorly due to the ridiculously organised fixture list , having to travel to glamorgan ( 1sts ) , cardiff and bristol ( uwe ) in the first three weeks of the competition . the early departure times made it impossible to field the strongest team with players having to attend lectures , leading to three losses . their home form proves how damaging this travelling has been with a 4 - 2 win against uwe 2nds , a 5 - 0 wins over uwe 3rds and cardiff 3rds . last minute goals lead to defeats to both glamorgan 3 - 2 and cardiff 4ths 4 - 3 . irritatingly the goal that won cardiff 4ths their game was scored by tom kenward 's , ( vp student activities ) younger brother . however all is not lost . the team lies fifth in the league with nine points - the two teams above them have only 10 and 11 . furthermore the university is awaiting a response from busa after uwe fielded their entire 1st xi as their 2nd xi in a week when the 1sts did not have a fixture . this information is courtesy of their own umpires . the 4th xi season is finished already as far as busa is concerned and they are third in a league of nine teams with a set of results of which the captain , tom page , should be proud . the highlight again was the domination of southampton solent 2nd xi 8 - 1 in a classic 4th team encounter as previously featured in the wessex scene . the club will be hoping that the top three teams will be able to finish off their seasons in style and maybe the next time you read about sumhc there will be some silverware to shout about . for more information visit_nn _ _ all the text and modern photographs of sydenham , unless otherwise specified , are the copyright of brainstorm systems ltd. you are welcome , indeed encouraged , to use brainstorm material from this website freely for personal use . you may also republish the brainstorm text and photographs from this website freely on the web or elsewhere provided it is for non -

centred joy and gladness . on the other hand , if the aspect of heartfelt petition for this fallen world is lost we may enjoy ' praise and worship ' which is quite literally out of this world . it will be in a compartment on its own - stirring , heartwarming , deeply moving at the time and yet having little or no relevance to the reality of living in this world for god . in public worship and in private prayer , therefore , plead with the lord from a full heart about all the practical issues of living and revel in the fact that he is able to keep us from falling , able to present us faultless , able to do more than we can even begin to think or imagine . . . the kingdom , the power and ultimately all glory belong to the lord god , our heavenly father . the lord is king ! who then shall dare resist his will , distrust his care , or murmur at his wise decrees , or doubt his royal promises ? ' the kingdom , the power and the glory , ' here is a peal of praise giving glory to god our heavenly father whose sovereign power will never cease , even for ever and ever . ' the lord god reigns . amen , amen . ' the word ' amen ' so often thought of and used as if it were a ' religious full - stop ' is in reality far greater . it means ' certainly so ' or ' let it be so ' and gives us the opportunity to ' sign our name ' , and add our own voice to the great affirmations and petitions of this most wonderful of prayers . the authorized , king james ' version concludes the lord 's prayer with this magnificent ending . it is fitting and part of our godly heritage . however , many of the modern versions conclude the lord 's prayer without this ending . within the services of the church of england we use both forms of the lord 's prayer . i used to feel we were ' given short measure ' if the prayer ended with , ' deliver us from evil . ' it felt unfinished ; as if , as a visitor , we had been suddenly ushered from a great house having been shown just a few of the magnificent rooms ! however , it is in fact a fair reflection of what we find within the new testament . if you study the various ancient manuscripts from which our new testament has come , you find that not all of them have the fuller ending . many texts stop short , ending with , ' lead us not into temptation , ' or , ' keep us from evil , ' or even earlier . there is clearly some uncertainty about the conclusion of the prayer . the traditional ending could have been something which the apostles , or early christians , added as they came to pray it . as they prayed they came back to thinking about our heavenly father and the great themes of this prayer and ended , surely rightly , on this note of praise , giving glory to almighty god . this concluding peal of praise is absolutely consistent with the whole teaching of the scriptures . it is a telling forth of who god is ; the one true god who is the king of the universe . although around us men and women ignore him , although there are many who live in active rebellion against him , we affirm that god , the living god , is lord . let all the earth know that the one , living god reigns . you might ask , ' is such a statement of the sovereignty of god a charitable , a " christian " , attitude ? ' we live in a very tolerant age and surely the spirit of christianity is to be tolerant . clearly , there is a place for tolerance , but when tolerance , gentleness with those around us , leads us to suppress the truth , then surely the principle of tolerance has led us to overthrow something far greater , far more important . it has led us to overthrow truth . it is as if there were a fire at a great house and a servant went to bring a young prince out of the house , but the lad said , ' no , no , leave me alone . i want to sleep , i do n't want to come out . ' the servant would have to say , ' i am sorry but you must come out . there is no choice , because there is something great at stake - your own life - and that is much more important than sleep . ' if we allow tolerance to overthrow truth we shall be in great trouble . this is the particular danger in which we find ourselves in our own liberal , tolerant day . we are called by god to be his heralds , to proclaim the gospel , and yet we find ourselves squeezed by the world into being so tolerant and gracious , that we cease even to affirm that to god , and to god alone , belong the kingdom and the power and the glory . ' brothers , ' says the apostle paul , ' pray for me that i may speak boldly as i ought to speak . ' a prayer worthy of echoing both for ourselves and for our christian leaders in a world that increasingly tolerates almost anything . . . except the call to bow the knee to the one true god ; the god and father of our lord jesus christ . every great house has one or two particularly fine views ; views that display the estate , the gardens and the house to their very best advantage . as we conclude the lord 's prayer we are given such a view . ' the kingdom , the power and the glory . . . ' words which tell out the sovereign glory of god our heavenly father . there is no other with whom to compare him . his alone is the kingdom , the power , and the glory . the words themselves take us back to the heart and focus of the prayer , to the three great state rooms : the honour of his name , the coming of his kingdom and the doing of his will . this traditional ending is , as it were , a stepping back to take in the whole view of the great house in its setting . in a phrase it sets before us the whole vista of god 's glory and purposes in this world . like the flag , the royal standard , flying above a stately home , it may or may not be as old as the house , but it is there to affirm that the lord is king and that the lord is in residence . to him be ascribed all honour , power and glory . references ' able to keep us from falling ' - jude 24&25 the lord god reigns - revelation 19:6 ' that i may speak boldly'- ephesians 6:20 ' full of grace and truth ' - john 1:14 the lord is king - from the hymn by josiah conder questions 1 have you known churches or been through times yourself when either , a ) christian living was reduced to a dull duty , or b ) the easy words on our lips bore no relation to the tough and real world in which we live ? 2 how can we keep the right balance between stirring christian worship and practical christian living ? 3 is the word ' amen ' just a religious full - stop or an opportunity for something much more ? 4 the apostle john speaks of our lord as ' full of grace and truth ' . how can we keep this balance in a world that requires us to be so tolerant as to allow falsehood side by side with truth or even to suppress the truth ? 5 in what ways do these concluding words help us to focus on the sovereignty and purposes of god our heavenly father ? the whole prayer in practical use . . . the great sweep of human history . . . or the details of one person or situation in the life of a stately home , the business of the whole house can be directed to the general well - being of the whole estate or it can , on occasion , be focused on a single event or person . from time to time there will be activity in every room in preparation for a great state occasion , an important meeting , or a family wedding or celebration . on another occasion the whole household will be going about their ordinary business but with a particular hush and concern for one member of the household who lies very ill . as it is with a great house , so it is with the lord 's prayer . for example : we can apply each petition generally as we pray for the world and its leaders , and for all god 's people as , together , we strive to live for him in this spiritually hostile world . on another occasion we might first bring a whole series of concerns in our prayers and then ' gather ' them as we pray the lord 's prayer . following a prayer of confession , the lord 's prayer can be a response of faith and a plea for grace and courage to start afresh to live in a way that pleases our heavenly father . finally , we can cry to god for a particular person or situation using and applying each of the petitions in turn . the whole prayer can be focused and brought to bear , for example , on a particular meeting , or on a particular person in physical or spiritual need or on particular members of our own family . as an example of this last and less usual use of the prayer , praying for a son or daughter of the house approaching marriage , we might follow each petition of the lord 's prayer in turn and pray : ' father we place into your hands this couple as they approach marriage . may your name be hallowed on their wedding day in all that is said and done in the service and at the reception . may your name be honoured , too , in their relationship with one another as they prepare for marriage and as they build a home together . may your kingdom come , may they , together , submit to your holy rule and live in a way that pleases you . may your will be done in every detail of the great day and in each decision of the months and years that lie ahead . may there be a touch of heaven about this marriage . give them day by day godly wisdom , and peace that they may live without anxiety before you . grant them each a forgiving spirit towards one another as they adjust and settle to married life . grant them grace to withstand the particular temptations that come with wealth and position , and from would - be suitors who would break the marriage . finally , father , we ask you to protect them from every kind of evil ; evil from within and evil from without , and from every onslaught of the evil one . may your holy name be held high in this marriage , sovereign lord , king of kings . ' or , approaching a sunday evening service we might pray : ' father , may your name be held high , honoured in our music and teaching and in all that takes place tonight . by your holy spirit , take the speaker 's words and set our hearts ablaze for you , may lives be changed , may your kingdom come . . . tonight . father , we commend to you all the practical arrangements ; our individual tasks and our working together . may your will be done in every detail . may there be a touch of heaven , here , tonight . ' . . . and so on , until we pray . . . ' and father keep us safe , tonight , from any who would disrupt and spoil the service , and from the spiritual coldness , deadness , attacks and interference of the evil one . ' would to god that our national and local elections , great parliamentary debates , council , governor and board meetings , synods , church meetings and individual opportunities to speak for the lord were covered and supported by prayers like these . . . prayers after our lord 's pattern ; prayers that we can be confident he will hear . we make up our own prayers after the ' god bless . . . ' pattern , or read set prayers , but , to our great loss , we neglect this great pattern prayer of the lord . ' lord open our eyes to see the armoury that you have provided for our spiritual warfare . help us to take hold of it , understand it and use it for the honour of your holy name . ' questions 1 sometimes we will bring a whole series of concerns in our prayers and then ' gather ' them as we pray the lord 's prayer . are you happy to use it in this way ? 2 sometimes the lord 's prayer will be a fitting response of faith and determination after a prayer of confession . are you comfortable with that ? 3 sometimes it will be focused on a single issue . for example , suggest how each petition in turn , i.e. the whole of the lord 's prayer , could be relevantly applied to one , or a selection of the following situations : when praying for parliament and our political leaders . when praying for our national or our local church . when praying for a known missionary . when praying for a known person in need or sickness . postscript rescued from the gentle , well - meant but unthinking murmur of an ' act of worship ' and prayed with understanding , passion , imagination and a willingness to heed and act upon our own prayer , the lord 's prayer becomes - not the formal opening of a vicarage tea party or parliamentary session - but the power behind the great , guiding principles by which the lord would have us conduct every part of our lives . if we pray it in this way it will touch our families and workplaces , shape our churches , and over the years encourage us to play our part in making the world around us as god would have it be . here , in these few memorable words are the seeds of liberty and justice , trust and true fellowship of families , and of families of peoples , all founded on a common submission to the lord god , our heavenly father . it is not a pious mumble but a manifesto to change the world . . . beginning with those who pray it . it is a manifesto to change the world . . . not by armies , strategies , politics or organisation but by men and women at every level of society and in every nation and people - group praying , and living for the lord , by the pattern and principles of this prayer . under god 's new covenant , his ancient promise to solomon has world - wide application : ' if my people , who are called by my name , will humble themselves and pray , and seek my face and turn from their ungodly ways ; then i will hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin and heal their land .

died 30th . november , 1977 , in hamilton , bermuda . british playwright and screenwriter . the anniversary of his death is on the same date as that of oscar wilde . terence rattigan 's parents were vera and frank rattigan . his father was a diplomat who had to leave the foreign office under a cloud , and he was also a philanderer . terence rattigan attended harrow school and oxford university . his first play to be produced , first episode , was co - written with fellow undergraduate philip heimann , and explored the intimacy between two young men and its effect on the involvement of one of them with a woman . terence rattigan joined the raf as an air - gunner . his career as a playwright took off with french without tears in 1936 . he also wrote or co - wrote a number of film screenplays . he had a particularly successful writing partnership with the gay film director anthony asquith with whom he wrote for eight films . terence rattigan never came out publicly as gay and kept his relationships with young men secret . in the late forties terence rattigan lived with kenneth morgan . however , kenneth morgan left for another man , and shortly afterwards killed himself using a gas fire . the first draft of the deep blue sea , ( 1952 ) , was about a homosexual affair which ended in a suicide in the same way . terence rattigan invented the nice middle - class , middle - aged aunt edna to represent the type of person who would enjoy his plays . his comfortable drawing room dramas began to look out of date when john osborne 's look back in anger in 1956 started the trend of the ' kitchen sink ' dramas that dealt more openly with social issues . see the terence rattigan message board web site : http://communities.catharton.com/community/scripts/topics.pl?nodeid=105994&clientid=4948 work dramas first episode , co - written with philip heimann . after the dance , written 1939 , not produced on stage , but produced on television in 1992 . the belles of st. clements , 1936 , a film screenplay . french without tears , 1936 , also a film screenplay in 1939 ( directed by anthony asquith ) . gypsy , 1937 , a film screenplay . quet wedding , 1940 , a film screenplay ( directed by anthony asquith ) . follow my leader , written 1938 , produced 1940 . uncensored , 1942 , a film screenplay ( directed by anthony asquith ) . the dawn will dawn , 1942 , a film screenplay , ( also called the avengers ) . flare path , also a radio play in 1944 . love in idleness . english without tears , 1944 , a film screenplay , ( also called her man gilbey ) . journey together , 1945 , a film screenplay . the way to the stars , 1945 , a film screenplay , ( also called johnny in the clouds ) ( directed by anthony asquith ) . the winslow boy , 1946 , also a film screenplay in 1948 ( directed by anthony asquith ) , and a television play in 1958 , and a film re - make in 1999 . while the sun shines , 1947 , a film screenplay ( directed by anthony asquith ) . brighton rock , 1947 , a film screenplay , ( also called young scarface ) . bond street , 1947 , a film screenplay . the browning version , 1948 , also a film screenplay in 1951 ( directed by anthony asquith ) , and a television play in 1959 , and a television re - make in 1985 , and a film re - make in 1994 . adventure story , 1949 , based on the life of alexander the great . the sound barrier , 1952 , a film screenplay . the deep blue sea , 1952 , also a film screenplay in 1955 . the final test , 1953 , a film screenplay . separate tables , 1954 , also a film screenplay in 1958 , and a film re - make in 1983 . the man who loved redheads , also a film screenplay in 1955 . the prince and the showgirl , also a film screenplay in 1957 . pojken winslow , 1959 , a television play . ross , 1960 , a fictional treatment of t. e. lawrence , also a film screenplay and television play in 1970 . the lead role was played by alec guinness . the vips , 1963 , a film screenplay , ( also called international hotel ) ( directed by anthony asquith ) . the yellow rolls - royce , 1965 , a film screenplay ( directed by anthony asquith ) . goodbye mr. chips , 1969 , an uncredited film screenplay . bequest to the nation , 1973 , a film screenplay , ( also called the nelson affair ) . variation on a theme , also a radio play in 1961 . in praise of love . cause c � l � bre , 1987 , a television play . writing after the dance 1996 , with an introduction by dan rebellato , theatre communications group , inc. , 128 pages , isbn 1854592173 ( paperback ) . bibliography michael darlow , ( 1999 ) , " terence rattigan : the man and his work " , quartet books , 530 pages , isbn 0704371146 ( hardcover ) . this is a revision of a book co - written with gillian hodson and published in 1979 . all a question of character by humphrey carpenter in the sunday times culture , 9th . january , 2000 , pages 36 - 37 . " when his 1960 play ross , a stage biography of t e lawrence , was reviewed by kenneth tynan ( virtually the only british drama critic of his day to challenge the shoddy standards of the west end ) , tynan quoted some of the sillier exchanges of dialogue . for example : ' and is this only the beginning ? ' ' it may be the ending , too ' . tynan points out that the play is full of this ' pat reliance on the same antithetical device in moments of crisis ' , and gives another example : ' there 's nothing in the world worse than self - pity . ' ' oh , yes there is self - knowledge ' . " " this family background , and rattigan 's guilty feelings about his own homosexuality , remind one of the fiction of angus wilson ; but whereas wilson ultimately came out and glorified in being gay in his later fiction , rattigan never made any public admission of his sexual orientation . this led to a sort of polished dishonesty in his writing and even in his own character ; grahame greene said that talking to him was ' like walking on a very slippery parquet flooring ' . " " he was happy to pillage his private life for material . the deep blue sea ( 1952 ) is a heterosexual remake of the suicide of one of his boyfriends , but its aunt edna style of dialogue is woefully inadequate for the theme . " " it has become a commonplace to say that rattigan would have written better had he acknowledged his homosexuality ; but sir peter hall , quoted by darlow , has a wise observation on this ; ' i think the problem with rattigan was that , even if he had the opportunity for frankness , his whole repressed class background , the stiff upper lip of harrow , would have made it impossible for him . deception and restraint are at the heart of that kind of englishman ' . " why aunt edna 's hero turned into an aunt sally by aleks sierz in the independent : the weekend review , 22nd . january , 2000 , page 10 . " in the 1950s , terence rattigan epitomised bourgeois british theatre . for 20 years , he had written light comedies of middle - class manners and tales of stiff upper - lipped english gentlefolk . he owned a rolls - royce with a personalised number plate and always posed elegantly for photographs . to describe his audience , he invented the character aunt edna , a ' nice respectable , middle - class , middle - aged , maiden lady ' . " life of the english chekhov by jonathan myerson in the independent on sunday , 23rd . january , 2000 , page 10 . " he spent all his life in disguise , burying and over - painting the true sources of his writing . in reality , he was a carefully closeted homosexual , a devil - may - care gambler , a compulsive spendthrift who earned and squandered fortunes with seemingly equal ease . but you wo n't find any of these traits among the characters in his plays - from start to finish he rigorously camouflaged any self - revelatory material . " " the story darlow tells - methodically moving from play to play , unwilling to let rattigan 's personality drive the narrative - is of someone who might easily have become a completely different writer . but at an early age ( only 25 when french without tears made him the highest - earning playwright in the english - speaking world ) , he fell among traditionalists and never managed to throw them off . time and again , he set out to write less comfortable , more honest and searching plays , only to see managements or stars dilute them . they all wanted another french and with sad regularity he succumbed and gave it to them . " " when he arrived for the new york rehearsals of separate tables , he brought a rewrite spotlighting the major 's crime as a homosexual offence . rattigan allowed himself to be talked out of it . " everything but the kitchen sink by adam mars - jones in the observer review , 23rd . january , 2000 , page 12 . " rattigan was brusquely dethroned in the fifties with the arrival of the movement known as the ' kitchen sink ' , which had no patience with craftmanship and the implicit . the problem did n't lie in rattigan 's unfamiliarity with the sink - not to mention the kitchen - but elsewhere , in a bedroom where no women were entertained . authenticity was suddenly the touchstone of drama , while the laws against his sort of private life ( and the censorial office of the lord chamberlain ) remained firmly in place . " geoffrey wansell , ( 1995 ) , " terence rattigan " , fourth estate , 448 pages , isbn 1857022017 ( hardcover ) . review : amazon.co.uk : " the biography that caused such a stir in british theater circles in 1996 is now available in north america . and who 'd expect such a brouhaha from terence rattigan , master of the well - made british play , craftsman of genteel dramas and lightweight social comedies from the 1930s to the 1960s ? author geoffrey wansell takes the controversial step of prying open rattigan 's closet , examining rattigan 's hits like separate tables , the browning version , the winslow boy , the deep blue sea , and french without tears in light of his struggle simultaneously to accept and conceal his homosexuality . two situations proved to be deeply scarring : rattigan 's father severely disapproved of his career choice , and his first love was lured away by a ' man - eating ' woman . the resulting insecurity and rage ran through his plays like a seam of coal - black and hard , but full of potential energy . the book also probes the irony of rattigan 's later career , when the ' angry young men ' writers rebelled against his generation and against him personally for failing to grapple with some of the very issues that most obsessed him , but which he labored to suppress within himself .

offs . if wasps win , the cherry and whites will have to be content with qualification to next season 's heineken cup competition .- which is probably more than we expected a few weeks ago . gloucester 's bonus point win over relegated leeds at headingley duly turned out to be more of a formality than was anticipated in a scrappy game that died on its feet once gloucester had got their fourth try . four tries in a match is pretty good as a rule but this time round gloucester must have missed at least half a dozen scores through poor finishing and should have had twenty points on the board by half - time as chances went begging . the spectre of leeds losing their director of rugby phil davies to llanelli , following closely on the departure of justin marshall , doubtless to be followed by other leading players , confirmed the true cost of demotion from the guinness premiership . to think just a year ago they were celebrating their powergen cup success over bath . now next season they face the prospect of national league division one and a local derby with otley . as the game unfolded it was clear that the home side were no match for the cherry and whites who had more enterprise and purpose about their game but it was almost quarter of an hour before there were any points on the board . ryan lamb took time to settle but once he had kicked his penalty his partnership with peter richards exercised a growing influence on proceedings as despite losing early line - out ball gloucester confined play to the visitors ' half . frustratingly a couple of scoring chances went begging before mike tindall got his first premiership try for the cherry and whites and looked to be the visitors ' best player during the opening period . the tykes rarely threatened to put the visitors under pressure and their only score came when fly - half gordon ross executed a well judged kick to exploit gloucester 's poorly aligned defence which was caught out of position and winger tom biggs gathered to score . ross converted to close the gap to 10 - 7 at the interval . it was more of the same in the second half as gloucester 's forwards drove on competently which resulted in a try for the ever impressive andy hazell . lamb 's conversion stretched the lead to ten points at 17 - 7 . gloucester continued to move the ball about as two more tries followed in the next fifteen minutes . a determined peter richards used his strength to squirm over for the third try . james simpson - daniel then went over for the bonus try latching on to a deft kick ahead following a strong touch - line run from replacement james bailey and lamb provided the finishing touches with the conversions . gloucester lost both centres through injury . tins with a bang to the face and anthony allen limped off as the game went flat and although alex brown was sent to the sin - bin the home side were unable to make any impression as the match dragged on to its inevitable conclusion . ollie azam was a popular replacement and although clearly short of match fitness showed just how much his physical presence has been missed by adding power to the pack for the final half hour . a workmanlike performance from the cherry and whites but there was little intensity about this end of season game unlike the matches coming up . next week 's visitors to kingsholm , wasps , are feeling an unaccustomed sting in the tail of the premiership season after falling to the top form team of the moment , the rampant london irish side , so an intriguing league finish is in prospect with effectively a winner take all decider for the last championship play - off spot as a prelude to the euro challenge cup final . next week will be no place for the faint - hearted . come on glos ._. _ _ � peaches & herb - let 's fall in love / isaac hayes - black moses two albums that have one thing in common here . both are albums with several excellent cover versions in their respective grooves . i have , recently , been in touch with with ' peaches ' , francine hurd barker 's daughter . linda greene was the later ' peaches ' who sang ' reunited ' . francine , sadly , passed away last august 2005 . this is one of the nicest sixties sweet soul albums , which could , almost , have been recorded back in the fifties with it 's very ' doo wop ' feel . francine was partnered with herb fame on this lovely recording . the pair used to sing together in the back of their car when they were being driven places . the title track sets up the musical scene very nicely , and all that follows is delightful . the two solo 's really stand out on this album . ' peaches ' take on ' time after time ' is lovely . herb 's take on ' when i fall in love ' is really outstanding . the couple were / are from washington d.c. francine 's surname is listed on the cover as ' day ' , however her daughter thinks that may be a name borrowed from a friend . her real surname is barker . i think her family can be proud of their mothers album here . herb used to work in a record store . van mccoy used to hang around at the store from time to time , which led to this album becoming available via van and david kapralik 's production chores . well worth tracking down . on cbs , recorded in 1967 . isaac hayes is someone i felt i have neglected at the site . did n't mean it soul brother ! folks thesedays do n't record individual double albums on cd . in fact , the only albums that come as double cd 's are , generally , old albums or retrospectives . imagine me asking tommy sims to put together a double cd ? the industry would n't allow it . they want the next album from ' girls explode uncontrollably ' , or whatever they call themselves thesedays on ' american flop idol ' . isaac put together a major masterpiece here without a great deal of fanfare . this set was released in 1972 on stax . a lovely album with several covers , as i mentioned . he works his way through the writings of burt bacharach and hal david , gamble , huff & jerry butler , curtis mayfield , clay hammond and pitches in with a few home runs . of his prolific output , this double set stands up as some of his finest work . whatever you do , do n't say to anyone ' he 's the guy that did shaft ' . there is a great deal more to isaac 's repertoire . highly recommended album . top of the page � richie havens - the great blind degree / connections richie havens first made his mark at woodstock in 1969 , all told . at the time he was quite prolific , musically . his vocal delivery has an intensity that suited that period , and oddly , later on with this ' connections ' album for similar reasons . the man is almost pleading with the listener , which almost wants you to go help the man . ' the great blind degree ' is a lovely album . out a couple of years after that festival , the album catches richie in a contemplatative mood , kicking off proceedings with the social commentary influenced ' what about me ' . the second melody is a simply gorgeous version of the james taylor classic ' fire & rain ' . six and a half minutes of pure brilliance . richie covers the cat stevens song ' fathers and sons ' and the graham nash penned ' teach your children ' as well on this set . overall , a great effort , taken from the era of lsd and purple hearts . certainly worth tracking down . nearly a decade later , richie released ' connections ' . this was another album of mainly cover versions , ranging from songs penned by the likes of paul mccartney , bob seger , sam cooke and stevie nicks . the album came out on the elektra imprint back in 1980 . what makes this album interesting , is richie 's version of the lamont dozier classic ' going back to my roots ' . frenetic is a good word to describe this take on the tune . this became hugely popular in the late eighties in the house music clubs in the u.k. , almost a decade after it 's release . these clubs were places where the drug ecstasy became popular at the time . from purple hearts to ecstasy in twenty years . not sure what richie would , personally , make of all this . one thing i do know , is he is a highly original vocalist , and that 1971 album is well worth tracking down . ' roots ' has made some compilations and has been bootlegged , unfortunately for richie and lamont . top of the page � kleeer - winners / intimate connection kleeer ( who used to be the universal robot band ) really only had a career that spanned six years as a band in that guise . in that period , they realised some seven albums . not your northern purists taste in music , however , on the dance scene , at the time , they were quite a remarkable group at their peak . in the same way that brass construction carved their own niche several years earlier , kleeer did exactly the same back in the day . o.k. , so here are two offerings from this great band . ' winners ' suffers from one malaise . that malaise is that the album , although being strong throughout , has an absolute killer track on it , which makes the other songs pale a little . if the album did n't have this killer track , it would have been a well received set despite the songs omisson . that song is ' open your mind ' . i remember buying this album back in 1979 , and before the set had reached it 's final track , i remembered being happy with the purchase . ' open your mind ' took the whole experience onto another level . a groove that runs for just under seven minutes long , delivered in an unfrienzied manner , and with some lovely instrumentation along the way . one track album ? not true , but essential for that song . ' intimate connection ' was a 1984 release . instruments had moved on . in some cases , in a bad way . there were artists either using drum machines that sounded like two sheets of metal being banged together , or those who were trying to emulate the pointer sister 's ' i 'm so excited ' . you know the stuff i am talking about . soundtrack to ' beverly hills cop ' movies , or miami vice shows , that sort of thing . well kleeer 's musical history kept the guys on the case . ' intimate connection ' could be argued as the group 's finest release . almost every track is of the highest standard . ' go for it ' is a lovely downtempo groover . ' the next time it 's for real ' is another fine melody . the title song is another great song , sampled by a few acts . favourite cut in this house is ' you did it again ' which is moody and marvellous . almost every album , apart from the hiccup , which embodied itself in the below par ' get ready ' , is worth picking up . interesting listening to the instrumentation changes , within those six years , on each album . as i said , the band kept their musical ' eyes on the prize ' most of the time . woody cunningham has released some nice solo material since the last album . much underrated and unique band . top of the page � liz hogue - vicious & fresh / heaven 17 & jimmy ruffin - foolish thing to do the liz hogue album i put here , as one site visitor has been trying to track down the song ' dream lover ' . she wanted the lyrics to ascertain whether the track actually is the one she was after . get asked after lyrics a great deal here . they are the most difficult things to find , along with sheet music and video 's . no lyrics on this album , so i told her the album was released in 1989 on cbs records and i said that that song is almost certainly the one she is looking for . basically , it is the best song on this very nice chris jasper ( isley brothers ) produced album . chris is recording on his own excellent gold city label thesedays . still making some fine recordings as well . recently featured his latest cd at the site . solid set all told . not sure what liz is up to thesedays , however , i am sure someone out there will let me know . this is a lovely album and well worth tracking down . heaven 17 ? lost the plot ? well , during the very early 80 's , this group , i guess , would have been described as new romantic , possibly . u.k. outfit that were popular at the same time as new order , soft cell and the human league were . heaven 17 had a little more ' depth ' to their sound if you like , however , their popularity started to wane a little towards the middle of that decade . i was in city sounds in london in 1986 and the guy who ran the place , called dave i seem to remember , stuck on this single and covered up the label . asked me who the singer was , and i said it sounded like jimmy ruffin . it was . dave had a really annoying habit if sticking an additional single in your bag , that you had n't asked for , so you always had to check your bag before you paid your bill ! lol . it was weird to think i had just bought a heaven 17 single , however , this is a really nice slab of soul music . downtempo and reflective are my best descriptions of this tune , that could have been one of those ' little label ' tunes from back in the day , out of the u.s. one thing i did n't realise is my friend camelle hinds played bass on this session . he was in central line back in the day . as a bonus ball , you also get a take on luther 's ' my sensitivity ' on the flipside . the fact that the a - side stands up to that song , gives you an idea of the quality of the starter dish . lovely soul music . top of the page � khemistry - khemistry / impact - the pac is back one from the eighties and the other from the mid seventies here . khemistry only made this one album , quite why , who knows as this is a very fine outing indeed and sells for a few dollars in the stores . the killer cut , delivered beautifully by marie council , shirl hayes and kimus knight , has got to be the dancer ' can you feel my love ' . i have loved this tune for donkey 's years . so full of optimism and as uplifting as a new stevie wonder album ! lol . this song made a compilation album entitled ' time is right ' here in the u.k. a few years back . the compiler thought the same thing i did and placed the track at the starting post . not a bad album throughout and very typical of that period . you get al johnson on keyboards , willie lester and rodney brown on production chores , which all go to make a great release . i already have the previously mentioned tune up at the site , so i thought i 'd add the lovely mid - tempo ' walking papers ' to enhance the proceedings . definitely worth picking up ..... as is .... .... the impact album , that seems to have been criminally ignored over the years . one of the many annoying things i have found with many albums from the seventies , is the lack of a listing of the band line - up , however , the group 's line - up consisted of damon harris , john quinton simms , charles timmons , and donald tighman ( who was related to sonny til of the orioles ) . this is a quite beautiful album of soul songs . released on wmot in 1977 , and produced and arranged by john davis , this 9 track set is well worth checking gemm out for a copy . ' carry me back ' has echoes of the double exposure tune ' ten percent ' , whilst the singles ' rainy days , stormy nights ' and ' smile awhile ' are top drawer dancers . for the soul purist , well , i , personally , love the ballads ' somebody loves you ' and ' sister fine ' , although the modern dancefloors would look to the final track , ' i thought you might like to know ' , which , if you are familiar with the main ingredients song ' everything man ' , this might give you an idea of where this song is coming from . nice album . top of the page � the supreme 's - i hear a symphony / the temptations - live at london 's talk of the town been concentrating on seventies ( and onwards ) albums recently here , so out come a couple of old motown gems .... and why not ! the supreme 's album has a lovely image of the holland brothers with lamont dozier on the rear of the sleeve . the trio wrote some fabulous melodies . when they described hitsville as a ' factory ' , they were n't wrong . you get 12 offerings here . if this was a re - release today , you would be looking at this , combined with another album and stuffed together on one poorly mastered cd . having the full original monty here is very , well for want of a better term , ergonomic . havin an artwork over twice the size of a cd sleeve just brings home how sleeve design standards have fallen . o.k. , you know the title track , and the rest are all familiar as well . ' unchained melody ' has a nice take on the original . ' my world is empty without you ' is gorgeous . my favourite is the swinging ' he 's all i got ' . yikes , i was only 10 when this hit the streets ! one year later , and the beatles were doing their sergeant pepper thing . love these liner notes . the album was mono and they recommended a ' new ' emitex record cleaner , as it ' ensured groove cleanliness ' . priceless . the temptations ' live ' album was recorded with a david ruffin - less line - up at london 's talk of the town venue at the end of the sixties . they were on the ' good ship ' norman whitfield / barrett strong team by this time . the odd thing about this group , is that the line - up may change , but the quality is always of the highest standard . we know that the man upstairs has taken the best part of the various line - ups , however , this is a lovely bookmark from that era . there are the obvious medley 's of the motown standards , however , the whitfield / strong curriculum vitae was beginning to hold it 's own alongside those evergreens , later to become standards in their own right and quite rightly so . i wo n't run through a tracklisting , but just cherry pick the group 's take on gamble & ross 's classic , ' i 'm gon na make you love me ' , which you can hear here , if my website annoying streams allow . what a great group these guys were / are . lonnie cook just mailed me and told me that ron wilson ( from bloodstone ) was once on the guys teamsheet ! lovely album , with liner notes from one tony blackburn ! poptastic ! top of the page � yasuko agawa - fine / issei noro - sweet sphere / naoya matsuoka - a farewell to the seashore / bobby caldwell - august moon i had an e - mail from a site visitor last week who was interested in some of the fusion releases out of japan some 20 or so years ago . i know i have touched on a couple of these albums at the site in the past , however , nothing wrong with revisiting quality , in my humble opinion . each of these albums cost an arm and a leg back in the day . yasuko agawa is probably best remembered for her song , ' l.a. night ' , taken from her ' gravy ' album , which , basically , sampled the light of the worlds tune ' london town ' . yasuko made several excellent albums , four of which i have here . i think that ' fine ' is the most listenable . you get her take on the evergreen ' new york afternoon ' , along with her additional take on hiroshi fukumura 's ' fill up the night ' . personal favourite here is the latinesque ' darlin do n't ever go away ' . very summery . issei noro 's 1985 album on japanese invitation records has a wonderful line - up of musicians . you have patrice rushen , phillip ingram , paulinho da costa , the seawind horns , maxi anderson , nathan east , robert brookins and kasu matsui . some lovely moments here in the shape of the title track , along with the dancer ' moondance ' and the phillip ingram fronted ' the message in the night ' . lovely album . naoya matsuoka 's album is an all instrumental affair . very nice fusion from 1983 and very unusual . robbie vincent , from radio london , at the time , used to take the track ' free voyage ' for a spin , and i got so hooked on this melody , i went out and spent a small fortune picking this album up . never regretted it either . another lovely summery melody . the last of this motley crew is an album by bobby caldwell , that did eventually see a u.s. release some several years later . i first heard this album on a pirate radio station back in 1983 . as bobby caldwell albums go , i hope he would n't mind me saying that this is n't one of his greatest efforts . having said that , the song ' once you give in ' was so wonderful , i was out remortgaging the house for a second time . this tune easily stands alongside ' down for the third time ' or ' what you wo n't do for love ' . lovely music . top of the page � lyn collins - think ( about it ) / check me out if you do n't know me by now i went to see lyn collins , along with the excellent martha high , at the jazz cafe , here in london last month . excellent the pair of them were , too . like the fool i am , i did n't have a page on either of these women at the site , so i redressed that balance and figured i 'd push out the proverbial musical boat and include these two great offerings from lyn from way back in the early to mid seventies . before i went to the show , i went to see a friend who works in the retailer called reckless records in london . they had both of the originals of these albums in the store , recorded for the people imprint in 1972 and 1975 respectively , each retailing for � 50 . that 's $ 100 in u.s. currency ! always seems to amaze me how , one year one album can cost a fortune , the next it is worth only a few dollars . these albums have retained their retail value pretty much consistently since the ' rare groove ' movement began back in the late eighties . one maliase that both of these albums do suffer from , is the fact they are both sought after for really one track respectively . ' think ( about it ) ' and ' rock me again & again & again & again & again ' . criminal really as both offerings have much more depth to proceedings . with lyn 's first album , well ' reach out for me ' is a lovely midtempo offering . check out her version of ' never gon na give you up ' . lovely stuff . the ' check me out ' album has a great version of the o'jays ' backstabbers ' , with the ' female preacher ' being helped along by the ' godfather of soul ' on vocal chores . lovely stuff . both of these albums are worth picking up and are worth investing in as they seem to be fairly consistent in a volatile vinyl market . not a bad listen either ! lyn at the jazz cafe last month top of the page � chuck jackson - how long have you been loving me ? / larry wedgeworth & clique - no more games a couple of little label items that surfaced in the late eighties . chuck jackson 's single came in to the u.k. around 1990 , although the sound is much earlier in my humble .... this is a lovely melody , which drifts along effortlesly and is well worth tracking down . released on the carolina records imprint and produced by charles wallert , this gets stuck in your grey matter and is one of the finest releases from that period . the larry wedgeworth tune is from 1980 and is having a new lease of life on many of the modern dancefloors . i have had this tune on the shelves here for around 14 years right now . i liked this , and bought the single , as it reminded me of the intruders ' win , place or show ' recording . very uplifting song that is dedicated to the boston celtics , who i guess are an ice hockey team ( sorry u.k. based and into soccer ! lol ) . larry went on later to become larry wu , who recorded the excellent ' let me show you ' and formed the group modernique . these are two lovely 45 's and would grace any collection . top of the page � gift of dreams - gift of dreams / the magnificents - on my way up two oddities i picked up around 1990 . the gift of dreams album , at that time , came without a proper sleeve . you got a white 12 " style cover and the labels , that 's all . the album , originally came out in 1983 , and this album with a cover , costs a pretty penny . the main reason why that is is because of the song ' feel it ' . what a lovely slice of soul music it is too . i do believe that that song is due on an expansion compilation album soon , which is great news . do n't keep the faith .... spread it ! this record is worth tracking down , however , for the excellent stepper ' by my side ' . lovely material . the magnificents 12 " i picked up at the same time . the magnificents were actually formed in 1953 , out of chicago , and consisted of johnny keyes , thurman ' ray ' ramsey , fred rakestraw and willie myles . they were , as many groups at the time , a doo wop group . whether the line - up is the same on this 12 " , heaven knows . what i do know is that this is a gorgeous mid - tempo offering , perfect for a summers day . the label says one d. beck co - wrote the song , so i 've e - mailed the man to find out if he was the co - composer . a really nice slice of the real deal . top of the page � bernard oattes - frame by frame / warren bailey - warren bailey many soul punters and deejays look to the nineties as a ' lean ' period within the scene , however , although i would agree there was a lot of sub - standard material around ( many of the ' real ' singers had gone off to independents ) , there were albums such as these two , which were fine offerings and should n't be dismissed out of hand . both of these saw a release in 1992 . bernard oattes was , originally part of the group called the limit back in the eighties , who had a club hit with the song ' say yeah ' . this cd was bernard 's first solo offering and came out on the sin drome imprint . bernards vocal stylings are n't to dissimilar to those of michael franks , with perhaps , a few deeper tones thrown in for good measure . i think bernard would be the first to say that , vocally , he is n't an otis redding . what he does do is occupy his own vocal range to it 's optimum , which is fine by this scribe ! i guess in today 's market , the retail outlets would add this album to the ' smooth jazz ' section , however , this came out long before that awful term was invented . at the time , the song ' the grand design ' filled the radiowaves on the better stations . that is a fantasic tune , it has to be said . the overall cd is one of solid melodies , delicate harmonies , embellished with , an almost , tender delivery . i love the opener entitled ' on the fairway ' , however , my pick of the bunch is the intelligently penned ' when i go to sleep ' . a catchy chorus , with some nice musical interchanges . lovely horn solo thrown in for good measure towards the end . very solid album and the best of his solo offerings , in my humble opinion . warren bailey 's offering , from the same year , is a lovely independent outing . i am not sure if warren recorded any other material . if he did n't , well he should have ! he did , however , contribute songs for the movie ' lean on me ' and did work with the artist taj mahal . warrens vocals are reminiscent of those of gerald alston 's ( the manhattans ) , which he moves around the scales with great dexterity . i remember , at the time of this release ( is it really twelve years ago ? ) , loving the song ' once in a while ' . very strong song that one . the whole album has stood the test of the passing years . ' turn back the hands of time ' is a nice mid tempo number and my ' cherry pick ' of the bunch is the glorious floater , ' love struck ' . that was one of my favourite tunes from that year . as i usually say , at the end of reviewing albums such as these independents , is ' i wonder what warren is up to thesedays ? ' . wherever he is , he ought to record another project . worth buying for ' love struck ' on it 's own . top of the page � breakwater -breakwater / splashdown recently , i was in touch with a guy called daryll williams . daryll 's brother is kae williams jnr , who was the nucleus of this group . breakwater only released two albums , for the arista imprint , in 1978 and 1980 , respectively . kae williams snr , at one time , managed the group the silhouettes amongst many other lifetime achievements . there is a page on him at the site ( check ' the artists ' page ) . i picked up both of these albums on their release dates . the first album is , perhaps , a better offering , although their finest moment came via the second set , that moment being the excellent ' say you love me girl ' . that song was a big r & b hit both sides of the atlantic and has led to both of these albums being highly collectable . returning to the first album , well , this is a very consistent set throughout . robbie vincent , at radio london , used to take the fusion tune , ' feel your way ' , for a spin on his legendary saturday shows , although , my personal favourite here is the grey & hanks penned ' no limits ' . in a way , that was a perfect tune from that time . melody , optimism and no drum machine 's ! this really is an album i would recommend to anyone . fine song led melodies . just about everything that a soul fan might desire . ' splashdown ' , does also have it 's moments , apart from the aforementioned ' say you love me girl ' ( which you really do need as a matter of some urgency ! ) . there are some excellent ballads that arrive in the form of ' love of my life ' and ' the one in my dreams ' . ' let love in ' is a nice midtempo offering , whilst ' time ' ought to be very high up on every discerning collector 's ' wants list ' . a lovely song . the group went their seperate ways after leaving arista and all left the music business with the exception of kae who became a freelance pianist , songwriter and producer , working with the likes of , change , the richie family , bb & q , mason , phyllis hyman and miki howard amongst others . both of these albums are available at gemm on cd and vinyl . you pays your money .... click here . top of the page � al broomfield - broomfield / certain kinds of weather when al broomfields 1987 , self - titled , album arrived on these shores , it was regarded as one of the finest albums of the eighties by soul fans . that accolade was richly deserved , as that album was right up there with the ' rapture 's ' ( anita baker ) of that era . i remember the charts being topped by this album for weeks on end . al comes from a family of nine children , whose ranks include dee dee and eugene wilde . very talented family . al has been in touch with me recently regarding a new project he is working on , which is great news . ca n't have someone of his calibre sitting around , can we ? not many people are aware of his second , 1991 album . that set , unfairly , came and went without a fanfare , perhaps due to the time lapse between releases ? al 's first album was , as i have already mentioned , a fine affair . the very first track , ' where do i go from here ? ' , really sets the highest standard and what follows on is more of the same . the radio stations picked up on that track , along with ' do n't cover up your feelings ' and ' is it so hard ' . it is hard to pick a favourite from this set , although the latter of that trio is quite excellent . on the ballad side ' through all the years ' is quite beautiful . if you do n't have this album , you really need to own a copy . a very fine soul album . al 's 1991 album was another fine offering . i never could understand how his first set was received so well , whilst this set , well , was n't really received at all ! we were notified , prior to this release , via a twelve from this album called ' i wo n't rush you ' . the killer tune here has to be the title track , which is a bright and breezy dancer , that has the chorus swirling around in the grey matter . lovely stuff . i used to play this song at various venues and folks always asked after the tune . this album was released on n'effect records , whilst his debut came out on the vision imprint . al broomfield is a very underrated singer and i am looking forward to the new material . top of the page � carl anderson - absence with out love / on & on carl anderson 's passing last week ( today is the first day of march 2004 ) was one obituary that provoked so much e - mail at the site , that i did n't do anything here for nearly two days . just replied in the best way i could . carl 's path must have crossed nearly everybody in the united states . i had e - mails for people who had toured with him , people who knew him in the sixties , and some very close friends who were , almost inconsolable . peter young at jazz fm paid a very nice tribute to the man this sunday . i included a piece on the respect page at the site , however , i also wanted to further the tributes by adding these two albums at the site , on this page , by this great man . he may have been a fabulous actor , however , i feel his body of musical work is second to none . ' absence with out love ' will always be highly regarded as his debut set , mainly for the outstanding stevie wonder tune ' buttercup ' . this is a classic song , which is held in such high regard in the u.k. , that it still receives heavy rotation on many stations . the album is a little hard to find , however , it is worth pursuing for several of the other melodies herein . my personal favourite is the song ' going out again ' , which meant a great deal to me back in 1982 after a seperation that was very distressing . these albums were released on the epic label in 1982 and 1984 respectively . so onto ' on and on ' , which was carl 's 1984 offering . by the way , artistic contributions to the two fine albums included , vaneese thomas , carmen lundy , omar hakim , paul jackson jnr , sonny burke , freddie washington , nathan east , jerry hey , jim gilstrap , paulette mcwilliams , teena marie and john barnes . after carl turning many peoples ears onto his music via the stevie tune , this release really consolidated his musical presence . my personal favourite tune here is the fabulous duet with vaneese thomas , entitled ' it 's the love ' . one of my favourite ' 80 's melodies . on the stations here , the songs ' magic ' and ' time to win ' received heavy airplay and were quite outstanding in their own right . carl was one of those rare artists whose albums were consistant throughout his recording career . i know that he will be sorely missed by many who knew him . i never shook the man 's hand , although , from the site responses regarding the high esteem he was held in by folks close to the man , i think we would have had a beer and a long talk , if we had ever met . do go buy any of his albums . the royalties will get to his family . a real singer , who is held in the highest regard by the real soul fraternity . i guess if the sum total of a person 's life is judged by the people that remember you , carl will still be around for decades to come . nice albums these two . peace . top of the page � mystic merlin - full moon / major harris - how do you take your love i know that i have scanned and written a couple of sentences regarding the mystic merlin album on these pages previously , however , i felt i did n't do the album justice . another thing that prompted me to return to this set , is the fact that freddie jackson 's people have been in touch . i spoke about this album and freddie does n't have a copy , so i have cdr'd this set and i will mail out the album shortly . freddie 's inclusion in the band arrived after three previous albums , with the song ' just ca n't give you up ' ( from the first offering ) becoming a dance classic over the years . this album is mainly sought after for the ' rare groove ' song ' mr. magician ' . a great track . this album has a very eighties vibe going on . all bar one track are uptempo and seem almost like a snapshot in time , musically . freddie left the group shortly after this set was released and the rest , as they say , is history . his new music is of a very high quality . not sure of how it will fare in todays ' plastic homogenised musical marketplace ' , however , i will be shouting from the rooftops here , supporting the artists of the calibre of freddie jackson . i have added some real audio on the sole ballad from this album . the song is called ' your love ' , which builds very nicely . mystic merlin went on to record under the band name of ' storm ' in the late eighties and early nineties . this is a nice album . the major harris album came and went without any major fanfare back in 1978 . i guess folks were listening to dolly parton 's and the beach boys disco records . the ' smooth jazz ' of it 's day ? well maybe . one thing i do know is this album has stood the test of time majestically . initially , you get a 10 minute track which is called ' i wanna dance with you ' , which , even after a three minute ballad intro , you know that the thump of a disco drum will appear at some point in the proceedings . of it 's type , it ai n't half bad . it is the material that follows that will delight the soul fan . one track of interest to chaka khan fans is that this set includes the original version of ' night moods ' , a track that was later to appear on her album ' whatcha gon na do for me ' in 1981 . the pick of the tracks are , well , all of the rest really . there is a modern dancer that will please the diehard northern fan in the shape of ' let me take you there ' . the title track is a fantastic slice of soul music . my personal favourite is the catchy ' you 're so good , you 're bad ' which will have the listener singing along in no time . this is an excellent and much ignored album . by the way , you have artistic input from the likes of david lasley , luther vandross , wilbur bascomb and will lee , which tops things off very nicely . top of the page � the moments - those sexy moments / larry graham - fired up two albums here released a decade apart and highlighting the changes in technology within those years . the moments album i picked up shortly after it 's release in 1974 . the main interest for most fans was the inclusion of the pop hit ' girls ' , recorded along with the whatnauts . that single i had bought previously to the album release , and , as was my habit back in the day , i used to take 45 's along to various clubs we went to , in case the deejay did n't have a copy . one deejay listened on his heaphones and told me ' i am not going to play that ... it will do nothing ' ! well history .... etc . ' girls ' proved to be a massive hit , although this album was widely ignored , which was a real shame . not your usual ' love on a two way street ' album this one . the miami sound was highly popular at the time , and sylvia robinson 's new jersey sound and her all platinum label created their own vibe , of which this is a fine example . ' girls ' almost seems out of place on this fine album . the grooves are tender and rhythmical . they are almost hypnotic . i really recommend you track down this album ( which should n't be too hard to find ) . the moments had a sexual sound all of their own , typified by the lengthy ' sexy mama ' . sylvia later covered the melody ' next time i see you ' on her 1976 self - titled album and ' ride your pony girl ' is another good example of the new jersey sound . my personal favourite here is the , almost plodding , ' sho nuff boogie ' that gets into a great groove . delightful . a decade or so later and out go the real drums and in come the dreadful drum machines of the eighties . stuck plumb right in the middle of that era is this 1985 album , that only saw a release in japan on warner brothers , is this set by larry graham . now i am not going to say that i like all this set . the drum machines were designed by aspirin manufacturers in my humble .... i picked up this album ( which i had to sell me right arm to get ! ) for the dancer ' what we all need is more love ' ( an old robbie vincent favourite ) , which toned down the drums , with larry pleading for more world peace . a very good dancer . the real soul fans will be interested in his ballad ' tearing out my heart ' , which is quite delightful . personally , i am really pleased i picked up this album , even though those machines have now passed their sell by date . recommended . top of the page � ingram - the ingram kingdom ( 1976 ) / that 's all ( 1977 ) / would you like to fly ? ( 1983 ) / night stalkers ( 1984 ) if you thought that the jackson family or the womack family are trying to take over the world , numbers wise , then the ingram family are the undercover agents ! check the covers of any of these albums and there are ingram 's coming out of every crevasse ! lol . to be honest , these guys have never really received their dues . they are all excellent songwriters and can pen a tune in many different styles . these four albums were released in a period between 1976 and 1983 . there is a feeling of ' london buses ' regarding ingram albums . you get two in 1976 and 1977 , respectively , and then you have to wait six years until the next two come along ! this period is evident in the changes in musical technology in that small period in time . the ingram kingdom 's first album i bought back in the day , although , i had forgotten about the set until some knowlegable fan asked after a tune that appears on this album on a modern soul group . that tune was the song ' what else can i say ? ' , which is a quite excellent dancer . there are some beautiful ballads on this album , including ' he 's mine ' and ' she 's all alone ' . barbara ingram 's vocal stylings are really exceptional , although she took more of a back seat on the group 's follow up set , ' that 's all ' . this 1977 offering is sought after for the fusion offering ' mi sabrina tequana ' , which became popular several years after the initial release . the group had now relocated to the h & l imprint . the title track is a first rate dancer , whilst ' i just wanna testify ' is a nice stepper . we then had to wait for the ' ingram bus ' for 6 years , until they came back with a bang with the barnstorming ' would you like to fly ' album . this record was massively popular on the u.k. dancefloors back in 1983 . released on the mirage label , you could take your pick as a deejay from several fine dancers . these took the shape of ' dj 's delight ' , ' no one ' ( highly underrated soul anthem ) , ' smoothin groovin ' and ' groovin on a groove ' . the radio friendly title track became an enduring favourite on robbie vincent 's radio london / radio one soul shows . this represented , probably , the groups finest hour , although ' night stalkers ' ( which arrived the following year on the other end label ) was also popular on the pirate radio stations here in the u.k. although , not of the same standard as the ' fly ' album , the tracks ' with you ' and ' drive me crazy ' were quite excellent and highly popular . ingram are a very underrated group as i said . it would be great to see a new album by the guys at some stage in the future . top of the page � maceo - us / the jb 's - pass the peas i was once deejaying with a friend of mine and the evening had n't really got going . he said to me , reaching into his record box , ' when in doubt , james brown out ! ' . well , to be honest with you , you ca n't argue with that sentiment . i have been ignoring the funk side of things a little here so , even though i have already touched on this jb 's set on these pages , i did n't do the album justice , so here goes . both of these sets are , james brown productions , are excellent examples of the funk genre , and are rare as rocking horse doo doo ! the maceo album is sought after , mainly for the dance classic ' soul power ' 74 ' , which is , undoubtedly , one of the best reasons to get up off your ass and get on down ! penned by james , this is dancefloor heaven . maceo weighs in here with his take on the godfather 's ' doing it to death ' , along with several other fine dancefloor fillers . of interest here , is maceo 's take on the al wilson chestnut ' show and tell ' . a great interpretation . check that out below ... streams allowing . the jb 's album is another filled to the rafters with great funk offerings . this album always travels with me to various gigs , if i am invited to play at them . the line - up is more impressive than that of the real madrid first team ! ' pass the peas ' , gimme some more ' , wine spot ' , ' hot pants road ' , ' blessed blackness ' , ' these are the jb 's ' etc . recorded on the mojo label back in ' 72 , i have , as i did with the maceo offering , gone with one of the mellower offerings in the shape of ' theme from king heroin ' . when james brown hung up his dancing shoes at the end of a show , he proved that he could cut it within soul circles . very nice addition to any collection . top of the page � david ruffin - so soon we change / johnny bristol - strangers two albums , from two major soul singers , that have been criminally ignored over the years in my humble opinion . both were released in 1979 in the post disco boom where folks were getting back to recording the real deal , which was a relief ! recently , i have been in touch with david 's ex - partner , genna ruffin , who spoke to me about how proud she was with her 's and david 's son and his new recording career . chip off the old block as they say ! as i have said at the site before , it amazes me how many artists do n't have copies of their own material . in an attempt to rectify things , i put together a ' best of ' cd from the vinyl here for genna and mailed it to her . in amongst all of the great material david recorded is this neglected gem from 1979 . ca n't understand why both of these albums never saw much recognition at the time . they are fine offerings . back in the day , robbie vincent at radio london and later at radio one and jazz fm used to take the song ' let your love rain down on me ' for a spin , which is a fine dancer that has grown in stature over the years . the single off this set was the song ' break my heart ' , which is a real nice tune . the title track is a fine ballad , however , my personal favourite from this fine set is the mellow ' morning sun looks blue ' , which is one of david 's finest recording moments , i believe . on warner brothers and really worth investigating ... and that voice .... ! johnny bristol is another artist that has , almost , taken a ' back seat ' regarding his recording career . apart from the enormous national hit ' hang on in there baby ' , johnny 's career has had it 's ups and downs , success wise . he deserves much better than the industry has credited him with in the past . his seventies output is second to none and ' love no longer has a hold on me ' has become a modern soul anthem . sadly , his superior version of the self penned song ' love me for a reason ' was covered by the charming osmond family ... covered in what i can not mention on these pages ! that song becoming a personal hit would have seen johnny achieving a more sustained success than he was credited with at the time . this set came out on the atlantic imprint and is notable for the title song , covered also by tavares , which is a beautiful mid paced melody , tenderly delivered by johnny . the songs are very strong here with ' if you ever need somebody ' being a fine example , also covered by the great gladys knight on a solo album a year or so later . ' when he comes ' is a nice modern dancer , that ought be receiving more attention right now on the more discerning dancefloors . nice album . great songwriter . top of the page � the younghearts - a taste of the younghearts / all about love recently , i have been in touch with a friend of the ex - member of the younghearts , namely frank hayes . i have two of the groups albums here , so i thought i would feature them in this section . the album ' a taste of the younghearts ' saw a release in 1974 . it came out on the 20th century label , which means that there must be a level of high quality within the grooves , such is the reputation of the company . well , this album certainly does n't disappoint . the arrangements are lush and the harmonies are of the highest quality . of the songs on offer here , ' for the rest of my life ' is very reminiscent of some of the work of eddie kendricks . a beautiful song as are the downtempo offerings ' we 're all god 's children ' and ' dedicate ( my life to you ) ' , which are ' state of the art ' ballads from the era . the real nugget here has to be the mid - tempo stepper ' you 're not here with me ' , which stands up alongside many of the seventies finest offerings . esther phillips once told us ' what a difference a day makes ' , well a three year gap resulted in a very different sound for the group . contemporary at the time , and enjoyable from a completely different perspective . produced by george tobin , this is another excellent bookmark from the seventies . the guys cover heatwave 's song ' sho nuff must be love ' and david gates torch song ' if ' . these are not bad covers although the standard is set by the original material , in my humble opinion . ' make a little wish ' is a nice mid tempo offering and the opener , ' let 's fall in love again ' , is a competent dancer . drop down a beat or two and you come to my favourite song , a ballad entitled ' queen of my heart ' . out on abc in 1977 and a very nice addition to any soul collection . frank hayes , from the group , is now recording gospel material . a very underrated group . top of the page � mel brown - actor of music / blue magic / major harris / margie joseph - live ! i was reminded ( in no uncertain terms ! lol ) at the end of last week , i had been ingnoring this page at the site for a while now . fair - ish criticism , as i had been spending a lot of time trying to help various artists . guess you ca n't be all things to all people ? o.k. let 's try to rectify things with these fine two seventies offerings . mel brown 's album , i picked up in a charity shop about 15 years ago , attracted , initially , by the label ( abc ) and the fact that james gadson had produced the proceedings . mel brown has a real nice delivery , which may not have the strongest soulful impact , however , his vocal tones have a real charm . this album i missed at the time as it was released amongst a plethora of shoddy disco offerings in 1978 , the worst year for soul releases in my humble opinion . disco had a lot to answer for at that time . this album has become one of my favourite releases from the seventies . the whole proceedings kick off with the very ' norman whitfieldesque ' , ' i a man and you a woman ' . these songs are very strong . i like pretty well everything , with the highlights coming via the ' soul swing ' of ' restless moments ' , the drop dead gorgeous ballad ' does anybody really care ? ' and the modern stepper ' call on me ' ( not the jeff perry tune ) . a great album that i would recommend to any soul follower . the blue magic , major harris , margie joseph album was another that i bought back in the day . i filed the thing away and forgot about it until a writer at blues and soul magazine got in touch . he was writing the sleevenotes for some of the blue magic re - releases and was in touch with a contact at warners , who called him and said ' do you know there was a live album as well ' ? the journalist contacted me and said ' did you know about this album ' ? i had been helping him and was really embarrassed to tell him that i had a copy . totally forgot about this set . recorded at the latin casino in new jersey in 1975 . this is a double album on wmot and features four sides comprising the three artists . you get major harris pitching in with ' love wo n't let me wait ' , ' i got over love ' and the evergreen ' loving you is mellow ' . margie duets with blue magic and sings solo on ' my love ' , ' feelings ' and ' ridin high ' . blue magic take the lions share of the proceedings , covering harold melvin and the bluenotes classic ' bad luck ' amongst others . now of particular interest to soul fans here are two studio tracks by blue magic and margie joseph , which are both top drawer melodies . the first is a version of ' i 'm gon na make you love me ' and the second is the beautiful ' funny guy , funny girl , funny love ' . a must for blue magic and margie fans . nice photo of the whole line - up in the centre of the gatefold as well . top of the page � marvin gaye - vulnerable since the artists death , nearly twenty years ago , marvin gaye 's famous albums have been re - released in various forms , deluxe packages ( the ' i want you ' deluxe edition is due shortly ) and several really excellent ' finds ' . these included the brilliant ' where are we going ? ' , the lesser known , ' my last chance ' and then there is this release . around two years ago i took a call from gilles peterson 's people at radio one here in the u.k. gilles was to interview carmen lundy that night on his show and he , usually , asked the visiting artists to choose a few tunes that made up their favourites around at the time . carmen asked gilles if he could play a track off this album and the bbc did n't have a copy ! i thought they owned everything . gilles 's colleague called and asked me if i had a copy of the album . i told him i did and asked when the show was to go out . logistically , the album could n't have got there in time , so the show went on without the marvin songs . this album saw a release in 1997 and came out without any fanfare , which was a shame as marvin , himself , stated that this was was his favourite personal album of his own material . whilst recording the love and political songs throughout the sixties , seventies and eighties , marvin always wanted to record a ' big band ' style outing . he loved nat king cole 's stylings and he wanted to be recognised as a great singer within that field of jazz music . everytime he had a spare moment , he would work on these songs and carry them around with him wherever he travelled . there are , actually only six tunes included here , with a total of ten in all . marvin recorded two versions of much of his own material , as many of you know if you own the deluxe version of the ' what 's going on ' album . two versions of the whole album on that release ! two versions of four of the songs on this set . on ' vulnerable ' , marvin covers these tunes with a touching and tender delivery . my personal favourite here is his take on the frank loesser tune ' i wish i did n't love you so ' . you can listen to that track below . in 1979 , it is said that berry gordy told him he could release anything he wished . at that time ' the ballads ' , as it was known then , never saw the light of day . marvin thought it would n't sell . guess he was correct judging by the cool reception this set received on release , finally , in 1997 . i would urge you to go buy this album , bearing in mind you are buying marvin recording a straightahead jazz ballad album , sit down with a glass of wine and let this set wash over you . very important marvin release and criminally ignored . top of the page � david oliver - jamerican man / mind magic david oliver is a real unsung hero of soul music ( and that is an understatement ! ) born to jamaican parents , david grew up in florida during the sixties and seventies . he released 4 albums for the mercury imprint in the late seventies and early eighties before passing away in 1981 . quite why david died is a mystery to me . all i know is that these 4 albums are criminally overlooked . in fact , i can only remember the excellent voices from the shadows magazine running a piece on him over 13 years ago . o.k. , so who does david sound like ? well if you cross curtis mayfield with a dash of russell thompkins jnr and add a slice of ted mills , then you are ' kind of ' getting there . you may think different . horses for courses , i guess . thank heavens for wayne henderson and his at home productions set - up for bringing david to the world during his latter days . the first of this quartet of albums saw the light of day in 1977 . ' jamerican man 's ' cover seems to have influenced miles davis ' tutu ' artwork a decade or so later . the artistic line - up is one to make your mouth water . vance tenort , roland bautista , augie johnson and bobby lyle to name but a few . this album is notable for the initial version of the tune ' friends and strangers ' . that melody has been utilised by several people at a later stage , including dave grusin and ronnie laws . david co - wrote the song with william jeffreys and ruth robinson . his version is ' light & breezy ' . the song ' love so strong ' is pure soul perfection . the following year , david brought us ' mind magic ' . the line - up here was , artistically , embellished with the likes of angela winbush , jim gilstrap , oscar brashear , greg phillinganes , james gadson and stephanie spruill ... begin to get an idea of the calibre of this man 's works ? ' southern comfort ' is an absolutely delightful slice of southern soul , whilst ' who are you ? ' is soul perfection , yet again ! the albums ' rain fire ' and ' here 's to you ' followed in 1979 and 1980 respectively . if the streams allow ( i know they do n't from time to time .... my apologies ... only two available at present ) , do check out david 's work . he was , obviously , highly respected by his peers . i guess the lack of a ' hit record ' affected his career . pick up any of his albums . they are all strong and , as a friend of mine who writes for blues and soul , told me . ' where has this singer been all of my listening life ? ' here , here to that one my friend . guess we owe voices and wayne henderson a beer down our local ... now there 's a thought ! ... want to know more about david ? click here ... top of the page � sheree brown - straight ahead / my music recently , i have , criminally , been ignoring this page and i began checking through the listings to see who i have omitted from these pages . i was outraged ( lol ) to see that neither of these two fantastic albums had made these pages . sheree brown is a very talented singer and songwriter . two years ago i was fortunate enough to ' touch base ' with her on the net and she sent me a cd of a project that her and patrice rushen ( sheree and patrice are old buddies ) were working on . that outing was called sisters being positively real aka sbpr ( sheree brown patrice rushen ) . that was a very nice recording which i featured here at the site at the time . one particular track entitled ' walking in central park ' featured sheree on an acoustic number . i e - mailed her and , like the nagging so and so that i am ( lol ) , asked her if she had any plans for a solo project ? at the time sheree was busy working at the new company , however , in this soul fans eyes / ears she is n't going to get away that easily ! her singing and songwriting skills are of too higher quality for us to allow that to happen . what of these two albums ? well , they were both on capitol records and were recorded in a two year period between 1981 and 1982 . i know most of you discerning listeners out there will know these albums like the back of your hands , so i wo n't spend ages going through them track by track . sheree 's 1981 outing , ' straight ahead ' is , perhaps , best remembered for the rare groove ' it 's a pleasure ' . that tune is pure soul heaven , make no mistake . the album is strong throughout , with sheree demonstrating her talents vocally and lyrically . drop the needle ... sorry laser ... anywhere within the album and you will hear the highest quality of music . ' my music ' followed a year later . many soul followers look to ' got to get away ' as the track to look out for . back in the day , when robbie vincent dropped ' on my way home ' , i had to put down the dishes ( lol ) and go have a lie down ! stevie on the harmonica , this is not only a soul standard , it is a standard in any genre . i bought both of these albums at their release dates and i ca n't count the amount of times i have cleaned them and carefully put them back in their sleeves after listening to the whole set throughout . these are jewels in any soul fan 's collection .

' he based it on his experiences of living in germany and kenya and describes a mixed race relationship between a white man and a kenyan woman , and how the woman became a victim of a racist attack in germany . ian learnt much about the history of kenya from a kenyan perspective and used this when writing his book . as a first time author it was diffficult to interest publishers in his manuscript but he made many contacts who also had links with kenya and who helped him when he decided to publish the book himself . it was a very stimulating day for everyone_nn _ _ grupo x ' food for your latinsoul ' " food for your latin soul " continues where " x - posure " left off but with an even more adventurous musical dialogue . the true spirit of nuyorican latin music is alive and well in the old - school analogue and live - band recordings , with heavy descarga , salsa dura , latin jazz , latin soul and bugalu still present . but jonny and the band have added extra musical colour to the picture - brasilian samba , puerto rican bomba , afro - cuban bata drums , ska , afro - peruvian rhythms , salsoul style string arrangements . a musical pot - pourri that blends perfectly and naturally . more salsa dura_nnp _ _ price : � 59.99 ( inc vat)| buy it more info the mapfactor mpfc-26 available from directions is a low cost completely self contained gps receiver , active antenna , power supply and usb communications package all housed in a neat plastic unit . this unit has features and functions that are only normally available from units that cost twice the price . the unit powers itself from the usb port on your laptop computer , consuming a small amount of current . the mapfactor mpfc-26 is based on the latest sirfstariii chipset with highest sensitivity available , and is one of the fastest starting and most accurate receivers available . updates are available every 1 second , and are accurate down to 5 metres , enough to see which side of the motorway you are travelling on !

pregnancy and the birth of a child . midwives support , facilitate and guide women , and midwifery practice is grounded in the belief that pregnancy is a normal life event and not an illness . the midwife is the guardian of normal childbirth , acting as the leader in normal pregnancy . the midwife can practice in a variety of settings ranging from independent practice , to group practices , birthing centres or nhs trusts . in all of these settings she works autonomously whilst maintaining strong links with other members of the multi disciplinary team . the bsc ( hons ) midwifery curriculum prepares students to undertake this unique role through a combination of interlinked theory modules and practice allocations . students are supported through the process by a committed teaching team and experienced clinicians who facilitate them in their learning experiences ._. _ _ social genetics : a polemical issue tom shakespeare this article originally appeared in network ( newsletter of the british sociological association ) , september 1997 do n't believe the hype ! ever since marx pointed out how darwin 's theory of evolution conveniently paralleled the social conditions and laissez - faire economics of late victorian england , biological and social research have contested the right to explain the dynamics of society and personality . in every generation there have been attempts to reduce the complexity of social interaction to anatomical or physiological substrates : think of lombroso , or the eugenics movement . or the sexist ' scientific ' assumptions deconstructed by janet sayers in her book biological politics , or the sociobiology controversies of the 1970s . however , we are now faced by a two - pronged fashion for biological reductionism which is rapidly becoming a new ' common sense ' , fuelled by the ambitions of publicity - hungry researchers and the susceptibilities of journalism . listen to start the week , or read the opinion columns of the broadsheets , and one would imagine that sociology as an intellectual activity has been made redundant by new explanations based on individual attributes , darwinian predestination and biological determinism . you could open a bookshop stocked with texts such as the bell curve , t he red queen , the sexual gene , the moral animal . popular science is a growth area , but these are not neutral texts illuminating research advances for the interested layperson : rather , writers such as matt ridley , charles murray , robert wright , and our old friend richard dawkins , are promoting a political agenda of competitive individualism and congenital inequality . biology is the new economics . two elements conjoin in this newly reactionary science - what one might call ' back to basics biology ' . first , the immense development of molecular biology represented by the $ 3 billion human genome project , the late twentieth century equivalent of atomic physics . the ' discovery ' of single gene causes of some major impairments and diseases has prompted a simplistic causality which reduces vast human phenomena to ' nature ' rather than ' nurture ' : we are advised that aggression , depression , homosexuality and many more sociocultural experiences are no more than the influence of genetic abnormalities . environment is suddenly a dirty word . very few reputable scientists may maintain this , and steven rose 's excellent arguments about neurogenetic determinism are required reading for the sceptic , but journalists and sensationalists construct the exaggerated implications for themselves . many disabled people are concerned about the threat from the new eugenics : however , genetics has also become a dangerous metaphor for society in general , with wide - ranging impacts for social explanation . second , there is the resurgence of neo - darwinism , in the form known as evolutionary psychology anyone ignorant of this tendency ( and it 's more like a political project than an intellectual programme ) should read the demos publication matters of life and death , which is no more than a manifesto for the replacement of social science by biology and behaviourism . more sophisticated than the original ' selfish gene ' idea , it is suggested that genes do not directly control behaviour , but that genes control psychology , which controls behaviour . suddenly we can explain jealousy , step - parents ' ' violence ' to step - children , homicide and so much more . these arguments , usually circular , and often of jesuitical complexity , come neatly prepackaged in leftwing and right - wing versions : almost anything can be proved . although , of course , the experts are still working on the problems of homosexuality , self - sacrifice , celibacy , and other social behaviours not easily susceptible to explanation via reproductive advantage . sociologists need urgently to engage with these arguments for three reasons . first , it is an intellectual imperative to demolish the shaky constructions which the new biologism has advanced : we can not ignore spurious misrepresentations of causality and the social world . second , evolutionary psychology and neurogenetic determinism are an explicit threat to the professional practice of sociology as a discipline : we need to look to our borders and our claim to explanatory competence . third , many of us spend our lives doing sociology not only to understand the world , but also to contribute towards changing it for the better . whether we are interested in crime , gender , sexuality , class or race , ' back to basics biology ' explains social phenomena with new stories , which are in fact often the old victim - blaming narratives . an engaged and responsible sociology should be concerned at the regressive implications of these trends , and should contribute to more egalitarian and morally sustainable explanations of human conduct and potentiality . yes , this is a polemical article . but unfortunately , sociology has largely been complacent about the situation . my conclusion is not that we should wage war on biology ( although i quite fancy a few tactical skirmishes with psychology ) . on the contrary , it is high time that sociology and social theory engaged with the physical endowment of humanity in a more sustained and adequate way . we spend too much time on linguistic and cultural mindgames which are neither accessible nor useful : let 's not go down the literary studies road . if we are to engage with our physicality , than we should look to the approach signalled by writers such as peter freund , ted benton , and feminists such as lynda birke , not the largely pointless meanderings of the new sociology of the body . many biologists have important things to say : people like stephen jay gould are as concerned about the determinists as any social scientist . we need to understand the science and the implications of genetics and other technological advances . particularly we need to relaunch and repopularise an adequate analysis of social processes and individual actions in the public sphere , particularly the media . we need to stop examining our postmodernist navels and get to grips with the contemporary world : as yeats said ' the best lack all conviction , while the worst are full of passionate intensity .

rural economy there has been much debate about the significance of hunting to the rural economy . a report by cobham resource consultants in 1997 estimated that all forms of hunting wild mammals in great britain generated expenditure of � 302 million and some 22,950 jobs ( or ' full time equivalents ' ) in total . a later study by the produce studies group estimated that � 243 million was spent on fox hunting in great britain and that this supported some 16,000 full - time jobs or equivalents ( ftes ) . one particular benefit for farmers lay in the role of hunts in disposing of fallen livestock . other studies , such as one conducted at newcastle university , have pointed out how the jobs directly sustained by hunt providers are generally estimated to amount to under 1,000 ftes and have questioned whether all hunting - related jobs would automatically be lost following a ban . the committee is arranging separately for factual information and analysis to be prepared on its behalf on the employment and expenditure associated with hunting with dogs and on the likely effects of a ban . questions 2 . evidence is there as to the importance or otherwise of hunting with dogs to rural economy in general and /or to particular areas of england and wales ? 3 . evidence is there about the likely impact on the rural economy if hunting dogs was banned completely ? 4 . what extent could any detrimental consequences of a ban be offset by participation in drag or bloodhound hunting or other activities or by measures ? agriculture and pest control there is disagreement about whether , and if so to what extent , it is necessary to exercise some form of population management of foxes , deer , hares and mink , either in the interests of the species themselves or in order to prevent damage to agricultural interests . in the case of foxes , it is argued that the need is greatest in sheep rearing upland areas , where foxes are said to account for a small , but economically significant , number of lambs and on estates where game birds are reared . on the other hand , foxes as predators of animals such as rabbits , rats , voles and mice can also be helpful to the farmer . in the case of deer , it is said that there is a need for a certain amount of culling to reduce damage to crops and young trees . similarly , in respect of hares , it is argued that it is necessary in some areas for numbers to be reduced from time to time to minimize crop damage . mink can cause considerable damage to poultry and wildlife . in addition , there is an issue about whether hunting with dogs is an acceptable or effective means of achieving any necessary population management , in comparison with other possible forms of control ( e.g. shooting ) . questions 5 . evidence is there about the need to control the population of foxes , deer , and mink ? 6 . evidence is there about the advantages and disadvantages of hunting with dogs in terms of agriculture and pest control , compared with other possible of control ? 7 . evidence is there about the consequences for agriculture and pest control hunting with dogs was banned completely ? 8 . other measures , if any , would need to be taken to protect agricultural interests and to control foxes , deer , mink and hares ? social and cultural life of the countryside in addition to the economic aspects of hunting with dogs it is necessary to consider other possible effects on " the rural way of life " . these include the importance or otherwise of hunting in sustaining horse riding and other equestrian activities ; the extent to which hunting and related activities provide a focal point for rural communities , encouraging social cohesion and preventing isolation ; the extent to which , conversely , hunting may produce tensions in local communities and may lead those opposed to it to feel excluded from local social and cultural activities ; the importance or otherwise of hunting in helping to preserve local amenities such as village halls and pubs ; and how much importance participants and followers attach to hunting as a pastime . in relation to all of these one needs to consider what would happen if hunting with dogs was banned . questions 9 . what ways , and to what extent , does the existence of hunting with dogs to or impair the social and cultural life of the countryside ? 10 . evidence is there as to its importance generally or in particular areas ? management and conservation of wildlife an issue here is whether , and if so to what extent , conservation of the present landscape and wildlife habitat ( such as coppices and hedgerows ) is encouraged by the various forms of hunting with dogs . it is sometimes suggested that , if fox and deer hunting were banned , farmers would be less likely to tolerate these animals on their land and might be less willing to conserve relevant habitats . a supporting argument is that they might also wish to deter poachers and other unwelcome groups . on the other hand , it can be argued that hunting with dogs causes damage and disturbance in the countryside . another issue � which overlaps with the earlier discussion of " agriculture and pest control " � is the importance or otherwise of hunting in managing the population of foxes , deer , hares and mink and also in improving the quality of the breeding stock through weeding out weaker individuals . a similar overlap occurs with the issue of the indirect impact of hunting on the animals preyed on by foxes . questions 11 . evidence is there about the present effect of hunting with dogs on preserving or damaging habitats and on the management and conservation of , including the quarry species ? 12 . would be the impact on these matters of a ban ? animal welfare because of the specialist knowledge required the committee intends to commission work to review existing available evidence on the effects of hunting with dogs on the welfare of the quarry species , including comparisons with other methods of control . the results will be shared with interested organisations and individuals with a view to achieving as much consensus as possible on the facts and the inferences which can reliably be drawn from them . the committee would nevertheless welcome , in the meantime , any evidence on these issues which groups or individuals may care to submit . questions 13 . evidence is there at present about the effect of hunting with dogs on the of the quarry species or on the welfare of other animals , including in hunting activities and domestic pets and farm animals which may be accidentally ? 14 . evidence is there about the impact on the welfare of animals of other means control which might be used if hunting with dogs was banned ? implementing a ban the committee has been asked to consider how any ban on hunting with dogs might be implemented . some of the issues which the committee will need to address , therefore , are the possible forms which a ban might take , how it might be applied and enforced and whether a ban might need to be supported by any other action ( e.g. to encourage other activities such as drag and bloodhound hunting or to compensate hunts ) . questions 15 . form(s ) might a ban take and what would be the implications ? 16 . might such a ban be applied and enforced ? 17 . a ban need to be supported by any other action ?_. _ _ like the normally aspirated xk model , the new xkr makes intelligent use of practical , modern technology such as its industry - leading aluminium monocoque body structure . in addition , an uprated 420bhp ...

" i know ' , he said , " cause i ended up the same " . he told me he was glad to have me around . then he went on to tell me that his health was n't to sound . the years went by fast . first , it was papa , and then mama passed now i know i did the right thing by not being a rodeo bum . like jake said , " our kind usually go back to where we came from " ._. _ _ whilst on holiday in cornwall , at penzance , i visited madron well , west penwith , which was listed in source 3 ( first series ) . i caught the bus from penzance to madron and walked the half mile distance to the well . it is reached along an unspoilt and ancient path , lined with blackthorn and hawthorn . it was like stepping back thousands of years , into a secret corner of nature , that , so far , has been preserved from the destructive onslaught of modern agriculture . the path leads to a fork , the well on the left , the baptistry on the right . we walked through the old gnarled wood to the well , along very muddy ground . the well is circular and stone lined , with rags and tissues hung from the trees around it . the wood seemed alive , yet silent except for a wren . there is ridiculous confusion over the dedication of the well to madron ; ' madron is the mother church to penzance and is dedicated to the irish medrhan or maternus ... others say he was a priest from brittany commemorated as paternus . the alleged date of his death is june 20th . ' [ 1 ] . so the well and area was originally dedicated to the mother , ( i.e. lat . maternus ) . modron means ' mother ' in old celtic . then there must have been an attempt to suppress the feminine aspect , hence the legend about ' paternus ' , just meaning father . his death is june 20th because as a solar representative he dies with the sun , at the summer solstice . the name modron is used in celtic mythology in a specific sense . it does not mean mother as most of us think of her . modron is mother of the ' virgin ' , or maiden . modron is the earth mother , sometimes depicted as a black goddess / madonna , black being the symbolic colour of earth , the underworld and death . the mother represents the dark or waning moon , and her daughter , the bride or virgin is the new and waxing moon [ 2 ] . this female polarity is a more ancient division of the aspects of the goddess than the later maiden , mother , hag . this dual aspect of the goddess passed over very clearly into christianity . st anne is the mother of the virgin , who in turn is the mother of the son or sun . there are many st anne or ' tan ' wells , which represent a different aspect to the numerous wells dedicated to the virgin , ( i.e. st mary , st bride or st helen ) . st anne is also a christianisation of black annis , for the mother is also the witch . this came out in the spontaneous , strong images which arose whilst at madron well . there were a black cat , a crow 's foot ( the ' witches ' mark ' ) , and a three - headed raven , presumably symbolic of hecate , called ' witch of the three ways ' . if you leave the well , and return to the fork in the path , you can then take the right hand path to the baptistry , a small ruined medieval chapel , and the most pagan christian building i had ever entered . the only entrance was in the north wall . usually churches block up or never build a north door because that is the direction from which ' pagan deities ' and ' nature forces ' enter . the altar , as usual , was in the east , yet was just a huge slab of stone . water flowed along the whole of the west wall . in one corner a spring ran into a stone basin , from which a channel flowed along the wall . water is the element of the western quarter in all western magic , and in churches the font is in the west . there is no roof on the baptistry now , and tall , old trees lean over the chapel . the ancient ' green ' pathway , the unspoilt woodland , the exuberance of the well spring , made this a place for the maiden , also the goddess of nature , to ' inhabit ' . this seemed to be a place for virgin and ' sun ' , as though all aspects were to be represented , at the two wells . by chance , i was at the wells on old midsummer eve , june 23rd . this is also called st john 's eve , or st helen 's eve . st john ( the baptist ) represents the new born sun at midsummer [ 3 ] . st helen , the ' virgin ' nature goddess . baptistries owe their function , some may say , to john the baptist . perhaps john ( the sun ) is reborn symbolically from water / maiden at midsummer . i feel it is important to appreciate the meaning of the wells ' aspect . by being in harmony with this , at the right times of the year , the wells are kept alive and part of their original function fulfilled ._. _ _ the anti - rejection therapy that you are taking also increases your risk of developing cancers . testicular cancer is almost always curable if caught early , so it is crucial for all men to examine themselves every month . this will allow men to become familiar the normal feel of their testicles , and therefore to spot any changes which should be reported to a doctor . the best place to carry out the examination is in a warm bath or shower . any new irregularity or lump ( even as small as a pea ) in the testicle itself , any increase in the size of the testicle , or significant shrinkage , or a sudden collection of fluid in the scrotum could be a sign of cancer , and should be reported to a doctor as soon as possible . happily , many of the changes will be caused by conditions other than cancer , but no one should take this chance . remember most testicular cancers are curable if you seek help immediately ._. _ _ the fpa technical directorate undertakes research , audits and consultancy in support of all aspects of fire prevention and protection . extensive studies are routinely undertaken on behalf of commerce and industry , insurers , military , local government and the public sector , to name but a few . our recognised experts offer a truly comprehensive service , which can be tailored to meet your precise requirements , as well as ensuring conformity with current legislation and codes of practice . our obligation to clients is to provide practical , high integrity , cost -

on luggage , briefcases , handbags , wallets , laptop cases , garment bags , sports bags , rucksacks and travel accessories , go to:- business travellers this group of travellers for the main part fall into the same category as the previous group in so fa r as they are never far from medical assistance when it is required . the main difference being that the majority will be travelling to cities rather than holiday resorts . a small group however , will occasionally travel to more remote areas in the course of their business . in this instance , a small medical kit for treating minor ailments will be of great value and convenience . the information supplied in this site will also prove valuable to these travellers . tiredness and jet lag may affect your business efficiency . rest before and after travel is important . persons with occupations which involve frequent travelling should consider vaccinating in anticipation of overseas assignments in order that the vaccinations achieve optimum protection , e.g. a first yellow fever vaccination certificate is not valid for 10 days . contaminated food and water is a major cause of illness in business travellers although less so if eating and drinking is confined to first class hotels . avoiding unsafe food and water can sometimes be difficult , when being entertained by enthusiastic hosts , unless a strategy is planned in advance ! it may be wise to always carry an anti - diarrhoeal preparation to make sure that you are able to attend important business meetings or to help you make long journeys without having to make frequent and inconvenient use of the toilet . unfamiliar surroundings , especially when combined with excessive alcohol consumption can lead to uncharacteristic behaviour including sexual risk taking . " unsafe " sex , particularly with commercial sex workers , may pose serious infections risks including hiv . backpackers & adventure travellers this group includes those who travel alone or in small groups on self - organised trips , and includes ; trekkers , mountaineers , climbers , bikers , canoeists , scuba divers , etc . etc . the list is endless . this type of excursion usually involves travelling on foot or public transport and staying in simple cheap accommodation . this can expose travellers to additional health risks and it is this group of travellers who will probably benefit the most from taking their own customised medical kit with them . vaccinations should be arranged with the doctor or nurse as soon as possible , ideally at least six weeks before travelling . check if malaria is endemic in the region to be visited . travellers are also likely to be exposed to infections and should be aware of measures to prevent illness from food and water , insects and animals and close personal contact with locals . mosquito and other insect bites can be minimised through wearing suitable clothing , using repellents and a mosquito net . beware of the risk of accidents when trekking or travelling on poor roads in badly maintained vehicles . backpackers may find themselves alternately in major cities with access to medical facilities and then in remote areas far away from medical help . they should therefore seriously consider taking a medical kit for the times when they will be far from help . a comprehensive first aid kit is important especially if going to areas remote from medical facilities . contamination of food and water is a major cause of illness in travellers . unless certain of the purity of the local water supply , stick to boiled or bottled water and avoid ice in drinks . alternatively , water can be sterilised with iodine drops / tablets or with a quality filter . dishes and cutlery should also be washed with sterilised water . hot tea , coffee , beer and wine are usually safe . ensure that milk has been pasteurised and that cheese , cream and ice cream are made from milk that has been pasteurised . peel all fruit , eat only cooked vegetables and avoid salads . ensure that seafood , fish and meat are thoroughly cooked and eaten hot whenever possible . avoid leftovers . wash hands before eating or handling food and always after using the toilet . a situation that is exciting and welcome to one person can be daunting to another . possible problems include adjusting to a different climate , unusual food , religious and cultural differences , separation from family , changes in living standards , different social amenities , language differences , coming to terms with poverty , begging , and compulsory movement restrictions for safety or political reasons . being open to new and different cultures and being patient , rather than critical , will help the traveller adapt to new and challenging adventures . for all your outdoor equipment requirements including mountaineering , climbing , skiing , trekking , backpacking , camping , canoeing , caving , etc.etc . go to:- expedition members expeditions , by their very nature are similar to adventure holidays so everything in the above section is also of use for this group . however , expeditions are usually much longer in duration than most adventure holidays , travel to even more remote locations and require certain skill levels and fitness . if you are going on an expedition you are likely to be exposed to more diseases than other travellers due to the nature of the location and duration of stay . you will probably interact more with the local population than other travellers . study , in advance , any necessary measures to prevent infection from contaminated food and water , insects and animals bites and close contact with locals . you will probably be travelling to extremely remote areas where there is no or limited medical assistance available . a medical kit together with first aid and surgical equipment will therefore be essential . if you are leading the expedition it will be your responsibility to ensure that adequate medical supplies are taken . consider taking a course in expedition first aid and emergency procedures . the medical supplies should be appropriate to the type of expedition and the region and should contain enough supplies to adequately cover the number of persons in the group for the duration of the expedition . along with the medical supplies , the expedition should ideally take an expedition doctor or someone qualified in the diagnosis of illness and the administration of medicines . if this is not possible then a handbook with instructions on the use of medicines should be included but will be a poor substitute . if mosquito and other insect bites are likely you should consider taking suitable clothing , insect repellents and mosquito nets . large , professionally organised expeditions are likely to have their own expedition doctor complete with a whole host of medical , surgical & first aid supplies . members of expeditions are usually quite fit and in excellent medical condition and will therefore , respond well to medical treatment . an excellent range of medical items on line such as first aid kits , sterile surgical kits , insect repellents , mosquito nets and water purification systems can be obtained from:- those who tr avel to remote areas on adventure holidays or expeditions should seriously consider becoming proficient in and obtaining a first aid qualification from a specialist organisation such as adventure first aid . please see www.adventurefirstaid.co.uk for details of expedition first aid courses . having a single strategy to deal with any injury or illness is the key to dealing with immediate and stressfull incidents . adventure first aid offers interactive - dynamic - contextual - cost effective training . long term travellers this group includes embassy staff , voluntary workers , missionaries , etc . intending to stay several years in a country . some people intend to emigrate permanently whilst others may only intend to visit relatives for an extended period . sometimes backpackers fall into this category e.g. those who take a year out to backpack " round the world " . preparation should not be rushed . vaccinations , prevention of malaria ( if appropriate ) , making enquiries about likely food and water hygiene problems and other disease risks are all - important . a brief visit to the proposed destination in advance can help reduce fear of the unknown . if you are travelling with children , plan to become pregnant or have any existing health problems you should plan well in advance in consultation with your doctor . a dental and eye check - up prior to departure is wise . backpackers may find themselves alternately in major cities with access to medical facilities and then in remote areas far away from medical help . they should therefore seriously consider taking a medical kit for the times when they will be far from help . first aid equipment may be important and consider what you might do in an emergency , particularly those going to areas remote from or with only basic medical facilities . the british embassy may give helpful advice about english speaking doctors and you should keep in touch with the embassy especially in areas of political unrest . homesickness after the initial excitement is common when you realise the visit is not short - term . going out of your way to make new friends and being sensitive to cultural differences rather than critical will help you adapt more quickly . c ulture shock can be very real . if you anticipate problems of this kind seek counselling before your plans are finalised . phone calls and emergency visits home to see relatives are often easier to arrange than you might imagine . travellers with special needs these include:- children elderly travellers pregnant women disabled travellers 1 . children parents should take special care when travelling with young children and being prepared in advance is important . vaccinations are important and schedules can differ for children so seek advice from your doctor or nurse . doses of malaria tablets are usually less than for adults . special seating arrangements in planes can often be arranged if advance notice is given . prepare for possible travel sickness . boredom during travel can be relieved by books or toys . remember to avoid contaminated food and water . if your child has vomiting or diarrhoea lost fluid and salts must be replaced . it may be helpful to take rehydration tablets or powders for reconstituting with boiled water . you can usually buy these at your local chemist . dehydration develops quickly in children so offer frequent cool drinks when it is hot . infections such as tuberculosis and diphtheria , spread from close personal contact with those infected , can be more serious in young children . childrens ' skin burns easily in the sun . take sensible clothing , high factor sun screens and avoid exposure to ' mid - day ' sun . keep children well away from stray or sick animals and seek medical advice without delay if any illness persists . 2 . elderly travellers more and more elderly people are now travelling abroad for holidays and to visit relatives . special holidays can be arranged but age does not give natural protection against disease . take adequate personal medications . these must be clearly labelled and carried in hand luggage for easy access in case of delays or loss of luggage . while abroad store your medicines in a cool dry place . if you are crossing time zones , do not miss out doses especially if you are diabetic or have a heart condition . if you suffer from any recurrent illness or are on regular medication check with your general practitioner . you may find a check - up helpful to ensure that you are fit to travel . a referral letter can be useful in case you you need treatment while abroad . immunisations are important at all ages . having had a disease previously , such as polio or diphtheria , does not always mean you are immune . if you are prescribed anti malaria tablets , be sure to mention if you are on any other medication . read the small print of your insurance policy which should include repatriation in case of illness and ensure there are no important exclusion clauses . remember to take care to with food and water hygiene and to avoid insect and animal bites . 3 . pregnant women travelling during pregnancy is usually possible but there are important things to keep in mind : always seek a medical check - up before planning your trip and again shortly before departure . it is important to get the ' all clear ' from your own doctor or obstetrician before departure . most airlines will not accept a pregnant traveller after 28 - 32 weeks gestation and long air flights in the later stages can be very uncomfortable . the most risky times for travel are during the first 12 - 15 weeks of pregnancy when miscarriage is more likely . ante - natal facilities vary greatly between countries and you should think carefully before travelling to a country with poor medical facilities or where there are major cultural and language differences from home . this could be important if you have health problems such as threatening to miscarry or going into early labour . illness during pregnancy can be more severe so take special care to avoid contaminated food and water and insect and animal bites . avoid partially cooked meat , unpasteurised milk products and soft cheeses . in some countries infections such as tuberculosis or meningitis can be spread from close personal contact with locals and these can be serious during pregnancy both to yourself and your unborn child . appropriate immunisation and malaria prevention is sometimes different during pregnancy so seek advice . some vaccines are best avoided during pregnancy , for example those that contain live organisms . however vaccination may be safer than travelling to some high risk areas without protection . discuss this carefully with your doctor or nurse . ensure your insurance policy covers pregnancy but remember insurance policies are only as good as the facilities available . 4 . disabled travellers travelling with a disability is now commonplace and there is no reason why this should pose serious problems if good preparations are made . adapting to unexpected situations is a part of the challenge of travelling but advance knowledge of facilities available , during travel and at your destination , can be very important . some organisations and tour companies arrange trips for the disabled when mobility problems , for example , are taken into account . airlines are usually helpful and provide assistance at airports and offer special facilities on aircraft if advised in advance . however this may not be the case with some airlines and at small airports especially in african , asian and south american countries . when selecting accommodation check good lifts are available , the condition of staircases and bathroom equipment . ask in advance if special food requirements are necessary . make sure that you have comprehensive health insurance with no important exclusion clauses which affect disability and which includes repatriation if necessary ._. _ _ share dealing and share trading online share trading online ; get shares information , news and tools

coherence and structure . without it , you are prone to the sort of problems that afflicted those investors who were overexposed to technology stocks in march 2000 . in short , to extract the maximum return with the minimum level of risk , you need a diverse portfolio of assets . you need to judge whether you have achieved this by looking at your assets as a whole . let 's say for the sake of

portfolio as it stands is unbalanced . there are , for example , no bonds in it , no smaller companies , and no tangible assets . how to protect yourself against inflation there is an old rule of thumb that suggests that you should invest your age as a percentage in bonds . in other words , a 50-year old should have half his portfolio in bonds , and a 25-year old 25 % in bonds . if you are concerned about the ravaging nature of inflation on bonds , then you can buy index linked ones . but government bonds offer low price volatility and a default - free income . if you are concerned about inflation you also need to be aware that hard physical assets are the only true inflation hedges . shares ultimately suffer if rapid inflation takes hold . so you might want to consider adding an extra dimension to the hard asset component of your portfolio by adding some tangible assets ( gold , stamps , art , collectable coins and so on ) to the property you own and that is already giving you some inflation protections . include a mix of company sizes and sectors looking within the share component of your portfolio , you need to take an approach to investing that takes into account not just the sector the company operates in , but also its size , and its likely volatility . try to mix small companies with large ones , spread your investing across a range of sectors without any undue concentration in any one area , and also try to have a portfolio that includes some growth stocks , some income stocks and some asset situations . try also to include some stocks that have been relatively stable in the past alongside those that display high levels of volatility . if all this seems too complicated , remember that you can get instant diversified exposure to some broad geographical markets in the uk , us and europe by using exchange traded funds ( etfs ) . these are tracker funds that trade like shares and mimic an index . resist taking a macho view of the market if this seems a policy for wimps , giving you a bland performance that might miss out on the exciting opportunities in the market , remember that the objective is to get the maximum return over the medium and long - term for assuming the minimum level of risk . aggressive risk seekers are often those who have never suffered the pain that sharp stock market losses bring with them . taking a macho view of the market is often not the best policy . diversification does not absolve you from stock picking . even if your assets are modest , academic theory suggests that you only need as few as eight well chosen stocks in diverse areas to achieve the optimum level of diversification , and that your risk will not fall significantly however many more stocks you buy after that . but the onus should be on careful choice and on not putting all your eggs in one basket . editorial policy is our journalism independent ? readers ' replies send your replies to the editor : theeditor@iii.co.uk the

airport planning & design | safety | management introduction the design and management of the airport landscape is primarily determined by the need to provide a safe operational environment for aircraft , passengers and staff . however , given that airports are an important gateway to a region , as well as a neighbour of surrounding land users , many airports are planned , designed and managed with the aim of creating not only a safe , but an attractive environment . most airports are located in rural areas and their development can have a significant impact upon existing wildlife . the landscape and biological systems within it represent finite resources of natural capital which in many instances can not be re - created . legislation and planning guidance aims to protect these resources from unsustainable development , and to promote opportunities for wildlife habitat creation and proposals which enhance the existing quality of the landscape setting . back to top role of the airport landscape the airport landscape can fulfil the following roles : inspire confidence in the airport customer ; reflect the positive characteristics of a region in order to inspire economic confidence ; enhance the experience of travel which is of particular importance for those airports which service a large tourist trade ; integrate with the broader local / regional landscape character ; respect the needs of the local community ; provide a habitat for plants and animals . back to top legislation and guidance various international agreements have been made with the aim of protecting the world 's biodiversity for example � .. rio / kyoto . a framework of international legislation which is specifically directed at the protection of features of nature conservation and landscape value exists . many countries have adopted international conventions and reinforced them with their own national legislation , with the aim of protecting certain species and habitats from harm , as well as maintaining global biodiversity . international conventions include : berne convention ( 1979 ) identifies endangered and protected species . ramsar convention ( 1971 ) identifies wetlands of international importance . ec wild bird directive 79/409 which designates special protection areas ( spas ) . ec directive 92/43 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna ( 1992 ) ( the habitats directive ) : which promotes the maintenance of bio - diversity within the context of economic , social , cultural and regional requirements . back to top airport planning and design given the role of the airport landscape , there are real cost benefits to be gained from taking account of ecological and landscape issues through out the planning and design of airport development . key areas that should be addressed include : the impact of development on features of ecological and/or landscape value ; for example on designated sites , protected species or landscape features , key views ; how design for landscape and wildlife can provide solutions which not only minimise the environmental impact of the development , but also enhance the site itself and contribute positively to the wider environment . for example airport development can result in the following impacts : habitat loss , fragmentation and isolation ; changes in landform which can affect the landscape character and hydrological regime ; contamination of watercourses which may disrupt aquatic ecosystems ; disturbance resulting from noise ( air and road traffic , people , light and movement ) ; air quality ; materials used for construction etc . , which may be sourced from ecologically sensitive areas . environmental impact assessment techniques can be used to assess the likelihood and significance of impacts . typically the following information would be collected : determination of habitat type within and in the immediate vicinity of the sit;e linkages with habitat areas ; information regarding the presence of protected species ; seasonal patterns , e.g. the site may be used by migratory birds , invertebrates ; sensitivity of the habitat , e.g. air / water pollution ; hydrology , existing landscape character ; current zone of visual impact ; location of key views . there are a number of measures which can be implemented in order to mitigate potential direct and indirect impacts such as : the planting of buffer zone of vegetation which can assist in air pollution control ; minimise the perception of noise , light disturbance ; odour ; the creation of new habitats designed to support specified plants and/or animals ; the creation of drainage lagoons for water quantity and/or quality control which provides opportunity for creation of marginal , aquatic habitat types ; woodland protection / creation for screening purposes ; retention and integration of existing vegetation for immediate landscaping of car parks and access routes etc . ; vegetation cover for slope stabilisation ; earthworks for storage of top - soil and other excavation materials on - site to avoid off - site disposal . back to top safety the need to maintain a safe and secure environment at airports influences the design and management of the airport environment , principally in the following areas : bird control ; control of ingress and egress of people and staff to the airport and movement of personnel within the site ; safeguarding , for example , height restrictions on vegetation . extensive guidance with respect to the measures which should be implemented and those which should be avoided has been prepared by the international civil aviation authority ( icaa ) . a detailed understanding of the airport site ; its surrounding environment and the considered opinion of ecologist , landscape architects and airport technical staff is required to ensure that the needs of security and operational safety are balanced with landscape and ecological objectives . back to top management in order that landscape and ecological features present at an airport , including those which have been created and or enhanced as part of airport development , are sustainable , regular monitoring and maintenance should be undertaken . whilst maintenance should not be regarded as a constraint in itself , it is important to include measures which will enable such activities to be undertaken readily and effectively e.g. provision of access for personnel / machinery etc . the preparation of management plans which set out management objectives and techniques can assist in ensuring a safe , attractive and diverse environment is maintained ._. _ _ 1 . good lives , bad lives what are good lives ? a good life is one that goes on long enough and also has things in it desired by everybody , other great goods . many people in african and islamic countries , as against we in the united states and like places , have what are underdescribed as bad lives , bad because cut short . half - lives , quarter - lives , children under the age of five dying . 20 million years of possible living - time lost by a certain defined group of people -- a sample . we do not know what to think about that large number and those people , but they say they are not flies . as for people with bad lives because they are denied one of the other great goods , which is freedom and power , the palestinians are an incontestable case . the bad lives raise the subject of morality and the question of the principle of right and wrong to be drawn from it ( ch 2 ) . also a question of whether we in america and like places have done wrong , whether we are implicated in the bad lives ( ch 3 ) . there is also the question of the true ground of the wrong done in the attack of september 11 ( ch 4 ) . further questions are of our responsibilities , and our counter - attack , and what is to be done now ( ch 5 ) . 2 . natural and other morality what is morality ? what is this natural fact and practice of our societies having to do with right actions , responsibility for actions , and moral standing ? what is to be said of attempts to give to the natural fact a particular definition or shape , as in certain worked - out social moralities ? our natural morality is a matter of collaborative self - interest in connection with the great goods , and a consistency having to do with reasons for our actions , and some sympathy with distant people , and , despite the fact of our subjective attitudes , some actual moral truth . the worked - out social moralities of libertarianism and of liberalism have been the most influential in the past 25 years . the first is intolerable in its self - indulgence , the second indeterminate in its good intentions . we need a morality of humanity , fellow - feeling or generosity . it is about saving people from bad lives by rational policies , not palliatives or moral visions , policies that will cost us something . this fellow - feeling is also better in being clear , and perhaps in being more in accord with natural morality . but a realistic inquiry , such as this one is trying to be , does not depend on agreement about this answer to the first question , about what is right and wrong . you can learn from a guide 's mistakes . 3 . did we wrong them ? do we wrong them ? given the bad lives , our natural morality and the worked - out moralities , what is to be said about us ? the political realism sometimes used by our leaders to excuse us , the principle of national self - interest , is not and can not be all of our attitude . a related morality of relationship , which puts your own people ahead of others , tries to justify actions by something other than their consequences . this morality , despite confusions about the opposed consequentialisms , must fail . as for libertarianism and liberalism , they are too disputable to be able to tell us if we have done wrong with respect to the bad lives . the morality of humanity or fellow - feeling faces the charge that it obliterates the distinction between acts and omissions -- that an omission with the same effect as an act is not like the act , not wrong . letting die is n't killing -- my buying tickets to venice is not like acting to take a couple of lives . is the distinction between acts and omissions , above all the omissions of our governments , real ? the hard conclusion against us about the bad lives does not need to be based the harm of our positive actions or commissions , which some attempt to dispute . we have wronged very many people , done immeasurable wrong . 4 . the twin towers , and democracy to stick to the plan of flying an airliner of people into a skyscraper is to be hideous and monstrous . the worn terms , by their use in connection with the killers , are recalled to original meanings . here another part of natural morality comes into view , our oneness with people in extremity , people about to die . to understand our conviction of the great wrong of the attack , the true ground of it , we need to understand more than the simplicity that two wrongs , the first being our own , do not make a right . we need to see terrorism clearly , settle for ourselves the matter of its nature and definition , and consider common reasons given for the wrongfulness of september 11 . a large one is often taken as having to do with democracy , with our democracies . we need a full understanding of our governments and societies , not only for our current question but for more to come . plain and general economic facts that show our democracies to be hierarchic democracy . they do not give us a moral high ground . the true ground of our condemnation of the killers of september 11 is in terms of the natural fact of morality , and the morality of humanity , and a particular policy of that humanity . it is fundamental that the killings were not rational . we can not use this morality here and , to look back , doubt its use against our own omissions . 5 . our responsibility , and the question of what to do are you like me , reader , in not having so much moral confidence now as at the beginning of this inquiry ? it is plain , still , because of our wrong with respect to the bad lives , that we share moral responsibility for the attack on ourselves . there are lines of moral responsibility reaching into the past for september 11 , with earlier and later perpetrators in them . they are as real as chains of command , and we are in them , with bin laden , bush and blair . there is another demonstration of our situation : there is a question of whether terrorism for humanity , on the scale of the twin towers , if the world were such that it could succeed , would be right . were we justified in counter - attacking against islamic terrorism ? a kind of confidence owed to our capitalism , the counterpart of hierarchic democracy , is in a way absurd . in human rather than moral terms , we had little choice but to counter - attack . we can claim a defence of our counter - attack if it is also true that we are changing ourselves in order to change the bad lives . this conditional defence of the counter - attack also rests on the morality of humanity . what we need to do now is to see the reality of our cultures as ignorant , selfish , managed and deceived , self - deceived , and deadly . we need to escape the illusion that the ordinary is the innocent , much of it owed to those of us near the top of our democratic and business hierarchies . all of us , americans first of all because of their power , need to think better . we need to supplement our democracies with transformations of the civil disobedience or mass action of henry david thoreau , martin luther king jr. , bertrand russell , and those in eastern europe who started to bring a wall down . are the conclusions of this book open to doubt ? certainly . is it possible to doubt the need for the reasoning it attempts , a kind of moral thinking that does not make up distinctions ? it is not ._. _ _ horace twiss was born in bath in 1787 . he became a student at the inner temple in 1806 and was called to the bar on 28th june 1811 . twiss was a staunch tory and in 1820 was selected as lord clarendon 's candidate for wooton basset in wiltshire . he continued to pursue his legal career and in 1827 became a king 's counsel . twiss was considered to be one of the best orators in the house of commons . however , he was criticised for his unconventional speeches in debates . lord campbell observed that twiss " though inexhaustibly fluent , his manner certainly was very flippant , factitious , and unbusinesslike " . in 1825 lord liverpool appointed twiss as counsel to the admiralty and in the government of the duke of wellington was under - secretary of war . twiss was one of the leading opponents of earl grey 's proposals for parliamentary reform . as a result of the 1832 reform act wooton basset lost its right to be represented in the house of commons . twiss was out of parliament until he won the seat of bridport for the tories in 1835 . in 1837 he switched to nottingham but was badly beaten . he was also defeated at bury st edmunds in 1841 . after his failure to return to the house of commons , twiss concentrated on journalism . he wrote accounts of parliamentary debates and editorials for the times . his daughter , fanny twiss , married john thaddeus delane , the editor of the times . horace twiss continued to be active in politics and died

' they are only three hundred and one . ' we set up a shout that you might have heard to charing cross - waving our hats - stamping against the floor and clapping our hands . the tellers scarcely got through the crowd . but you might have heard a pin drop as duncannon read the numbers . then again the shouts broke out - and many of us shed tears - i could scarcely refrain . and the jaw of peel fell ; and the face of twiss was as the face of a damned soul . we shook hands and clapped each other on the back , and went out laughing , crying , and huzzaing into the lobby . ( 2 ) horace twiss told e. j. littleton his opinion on robert peel ( 20th november , 1831 ) peel was the best man of business and the best debater in england - but always thinking of his reputation and his outward character - never decided and courageous - thinking more of getting well through a business into which he had been led by circumstances , than bold and decided in his pursuit and assertion of great principles and worthy objects ._. _ _ women as warriors from 3500bc to the 20th century margaret of denmark ( 1353 - 1411 ) jacqueline of bavaria , countess of holland , hainault and zealand ( 1402 - 1437 ) defenders of a bulwark in prague in july 1420 included two women and one girl who threw stones and lances at the attacking army .

" ecclesiastes 5:10 says " he who loves money will not be satisfied with money , nor he who loves abundance with its income . this too is vanity . " your spiritual development is tied to your view on money . jesus admonished his listeners , " do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth , where moth and rust destroy , and where thieves break in and steal . " but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust destroys , and where thieves do not break in or steal ; for where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . ( matthew 6:19 - 21 ) where is your treasure , what do you value most ? paul had a very non - materialistic view of money . money had become a church problem . he was concerned with trouble - making leaders and money was the source of their problem . they taught that godliness is a means to wealth . follow jesus and get rich . sounds like the health and wealth preachers on tv . paul says there is great gain in godliness . but , it is not as you might think . there is great gain in godliness when it is accompanied with contentment . we must be satisfied with what we have , not with what we can buy . our happiness and satisfaction can only come from pursuing god ! paul said in philippians 4:11 - 13 : not that i speak from want , for i have learned to be content in whatever circumstances i am . i know how to get along with humble means , and i also know how to live in prosperity ; in any and every circumstance i have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry , both of having abundance and suffering need . i can do all things through him who strengthens me . we can be content with whatever we have . in paul 's mind , if we have food to eat and clothes to wear and shelter over our heads , then we have all that we need . everything else is icing on the cake . it is god who empowers , strengthens and provides for us . so , we must be very careful of riches . rather than being our savior , riches can be our downfall . please notice the progression . riches become a temptation . you save a few dollars or get a bonus and you automatically think of how to spend it . it can be a real need or it can be a total indulgence . and quite often we do n't consult god , we do n't make it a matter of prayer , we just spend it . of course it is a temptation . anything that takes god out of the loop is a real and dangerous temptation . temptation becomes a snare . we get stuck on the subject . we ca n't stop worrying about it . whether you have money to spend , or have desires and needs that you want to fill , it all becomes a snare , a hangup that we just can not get past . the snare becomes foolish and harmful desires . the temptation becomes a strong passion . the word " desire " means , passions , craving , even lust . but this desire is further complicated in that it is foolish and harmful . greed makes us stupid � that is what foolish means � dumb , stupid , unthinking . we will seek to fulfill our desire even when it is harmful and destructive to our physical , emotional and spiritual lives . the final step is that money , misused and misunderstood , leads to ruin and destruction . how many men and women have gone bankrupt because they got greedy and overreached ? how many drifted from god and even become enemies of the church because of the decisions they have made about money ? and , it always ends up being god 's fault ! paul affirms that money is dangerous . the love of money is a root to all sorts of evil . it can lead you away from the faith and it can pierce your soul with pain and destruction . paul 's warning to men and women of god is to flee these things and pursue righteousness , godliness , faith , love , perseverance , and gentleness . is there a healthy and godly view of money ? i think there is . ed dobson , in his little book simplicity , gives three views on money that , i think , gives us clear insight in how to deal with it no matter our income level . there are three kinds of relationships to money . first , living above your means . living above your means is slavery , it is living in debt . proverbs 22:7 says " the rich rules over the poor , and the borrower becomes the lender 's slave . " i know about this one quite well . all your work goes to pay your debts . you are not free and independent but must first take care of those you owe . debt is often necessary but the bible calls for us to get out of debt as soon as possible and stay that way . second , living within your means . living within your means is selfish . while it is admirable to live within our means , if you are spending all your money on yourself , it is an act of selfishness . god , no doubt gives us good things to enjoy and we should always enjoy the good things that he gives us . we must never think that god wants us to be miserable or that he does not want us to enjoy our money and material things . however , money can not become our god . godly living means that we will use our wealth to help others and to give to god what is his . to live within your means is as much an abomination to god as is indecent debt . what god has called us to do is to live below our means . in other words , you do n't spend all your income on yourself . living below your means is proper stewardship . you do n't live too large . you do n't spend it all on yourself . it allows you to tithe and to give to others when they are in need . god has laid claim to at least 10 % if not more of our income . if you make more , god may very well expect you to spend more on his causes instead of fulfilling every materialistic fantasy that you have . if we are right with god , then we are going to make sure that we give to the causes that god has lead us to , including his church . ( ed dobson , simplicity , 117 - 133 ) money is a great seducer . it promises us the world . but the world can never satisfy . a healthy attitude lets us pursue the things of god . and at the end of the day , it is the wholehearted pursuit of god that brings contentment . nothing else will do ._. _ _ since our inception we have made a conscious decision to only provide bespoke cross cultural training courses . this is because we believe a truly excellent cross cultural training course can only be one that involves time , dedication and sufficient design work . off - the shelf courses are simply not our style . as a result we do not have standard prices available . in order for us to provide a client with a cost for a cross cultural training course of any type we need to know the aims and objectives , specific needs , number of participants , location and length . however , here are some guidelines as to what our cross cultural training courses provide : * all our cross cultural training courses are designed to be delivered over one or two days . for less complex training a half - day course is possible and similarly for complex training a longer course is advised . * the cross cultural training courses are designed according to the participants ' needs . we incorporate workshops , role - plays and other interactive methods . * we train individuals on a one - to - one basis and small groups . maximum numbers depends on the style of presentation needed , i.e. for lectures rather than hands - on training we can accomodate more people . * our courses can be administered at the employer 's site or at a neutral location . * all courses require one of our trainers to run through an initial needs analysis . if you are in need of such a cross cultural training course for yourself or your staff then please contact us to discuss your needs in detail and for a precise quote ._. _ _ kevala - leading the way in online learning you have discovered one of the most successful flexible and online learning schools with 1000 's of successful students . fully accredited diplomas in a huge variety of holistic disciplines the very best in flexible and online learning one of the widest range of courses available one of the easiest ways to learn a cost effective way to learn train for your future or your interest introduction & lifestyle courses in a variety of subjects for your own personal development brand new courses available theoretical and practical elements , informal assessments and cpd 's meet other students on tutorial weekends day and evening events open to the public_jj _ _ sensation as murder trial gets underway there was high drama in court when accrington ’s sensational " murder without a body " trial opened this week . man dies after saving friend a man has died in a hit - and - run after pushing his friend out of the path of a stolen car .

assessment of the potential variability of naturally occurring radionuclides in foodstuffs produced in the uk ( july 1998 ) 183 : maff uk - evaluation of the radiological impact of free foods found in the vicinity of nuclear sites ( july 1999 ) background in england and wales maff carries out routine surveillance programmes for radioactivity in the food chain . most of the routine surveillance is targeted at foodstuffs produced in the vicinity of nuclear installations , although monitoring of the general food supply is also carried out . routine surveillance allows maff to demonstrate that exposures from artificial sources of radioactivity do not exceed the appropriate national limits and to estimate doses received by members of the public consuming food that is nationally available as well as that produced in the locality of nuclear installations . to date , beers have not been included in these routine programmes . in recognition of this , as part of the working party on radionuclides in food 's ( wprf ) surveillance , a survey of the levels of radioactivity in uk produced beers was carried out to assess the possible doses to consumers . it is known that some mineral waters can contain relatively high levels of natural radioactivity and research in germany has shown that beers may contain equivalent , or in a few cases higher , levels . there is little information on the radioactive content of uk beer and , given its widespread consumption , a limited survey was undertaken . particular attention was paid to the correlation between activity levels in the beers and the source of the water used in their manufacture . it was therefore important to include breweries that used spring or well water , rather than local tap water , in making their beer . results levels of radium-226 , polonium-210 , lead-210 , total alpha activity and total beta activity , were analysed in 48 uk beers and compared for comparison , in 5 beers from germany and the czech republic ( see annex 1 for list of beers ) . the majority of beers had levels of radium-226 and polonium-210 below 0.01 becquerels per litre ( bq / l ) , similar to those of drinking water . the technique used for determining lead-210 in the beers could not accurately detect levels below approximately 0.06 bq / l and all the beers showed concentrations at or below this value . in the majority of cases , the lead-210 results were " less than " values , indicating concentrations consistent with those in drinking water . a more sensitive method would have been very time - consuming . the total alpha content of the beers were higher than would be expected for drinking water , at between 0.1 and 1.2 bq / l but , as shown by the results outlined above , much of this activity can not be attributed to radium-226 , polonium-210 or lead-210 . the enhanced levels of alpha activity are not a consequence of the water supply because most brewers use their local water supply and the activity levels in these waters are known to be low . it is therefore most likely that the enhanced alpha activity is due to the presence of natural isotopes of uranium and thorium in the beers ' other ingredients such as barley and hops . there was no noticeable correlation , however , between beer activity levels and the sources of these ingredients . the total beta activities of the beers were fairly consistent with the majority falling between 15 and 30 bq / l . levels in drinking water are generally below 0.5 bq / l . it is likely that the enhanced beta activity in beers is a result of the natural radioactive isotope of potassium , potassium-40 , present in the added ingredients . this conclusion is supported by the fairly narrow range of measured beta activities . interpretation in order to estimate the radiation dose received from consuming the beers , it was assumed that radioactivity not accounted for by the measured concentrations of radium-226 , polonium-210 and lead-210 was attributable to the same range of nuclides found in mineral water during an earlier study . assuming a weekly consumption of 13.8 litres for a high - rate consumer ( 95th percentile ) , the highest annual dose received by a consumer would be 69 microsieverts per year . this can be compared to the average dose received by a uk resident from background radiation of 2200 microsieverts per year . contact points photocopies of the report can be obtained from the maff library , for a nominal charge for the copying service : maff nobel house library room 807 , nobel house 17 smith square london sw1p 3jr in addition if you wish to consult a copy of the report please contact the library on + 44 ( 0)171 -

time try was something extra special and secured the 36 - 34 extra - time victory over london irish to finally secure the european challenge cup in a dramatic nail - biting , heart - stopping finale to the season . the magic moment rescued the match for the cherry and whites who had seen a 31 - 19 lead slip away in the final minutes of normal time as irish settled for the route one approach and their forwards eventually broke down the tenacious gloucester defence . gloucester 's lightweight pack , outplayed in the two premiership encounters this season , were not dominated to the same extent at the stoop on this occasion but for the final quarter of normal time and much of the extra - time were under the cosh for long periods . gloucester dogged it out but could not prevent irish going back in front and once again the heartbreak of losing yet another close game became a very real possibility . however in the end it was the ambition of gloucester that triumphed over the irish heavy mob . irish , the surprise package of the premiership with their enterprising play seemed over reliant on their pack , whilst the cherry and whites were more inventive and on balance just about deserved the spoils . gloucester had made a poor start conceding two penalty kicks to barry everitt but prompted by half backs peter richards and ryan lamb posed more real threats before an expertly executed grubber kick by the impressive mike tindall threaded through the irish cover for mark foster to pounce on at the second attempt and score in the corner . lamb 's conversion kick was spot on . 7 - 6 . lamb added a penalty to keep the score ticking over before the splendid andy hazell charged through following a lineout to take the score to 15 - 6 with gloucester 's second try . irish got back in the game when a kick from everitt put full back rob thirlby under pressure from two players and delon armitage scored for everitt to convert from wide out . 15 - 13 . the composed ryan lamb added another penalty just before half - time but at 18 - 13 the game was wide open with such a narrow lead . irish kept the ball tight as the second period unfolded but had no . 8 leguizamon sin - binned . gloucester were deprived of lamb through a blood injury and ludovic mercier slotted a penalty but that was cancelled out by a dropped goal and another everitt penalty . at 24 - 19 gloucester 's lead looked slender before a key moment lead to a vital score . irish lock bob casey attempted a long pass but james simpson - daniel gathered the loose ball to streak away from sixty yards . the converted try took the score to 31 - 19 and should have settled the match but the irish pack was firmly in control with strong driving mauls to compliment their efficient line - out play . desperate gloucester defensive tackling held irish at bay for a time but eventually the pressure told before olivier magne was eventually awarded with a try by the video official for irish that everitt converted to eat away at the lead , 31 - 26 . irish kept up their non - stop momentum in the final stages of normal time with a series of driving mauls as they all piled in and inched their way to the gloucester line before robbie russell was driven over , the try again awarded by courtesy of the video to level the scores at 31 - 31.everitt missed the pressure kick for what would have been a match winning effort with normal time running out . the intensity continued , the tension mounted inexorably in extra - time as the irish pack continued with their driving play before the pressure told and almost inevitably everitt kicked the resultant penalty to put irish back in the lead , 31 - 34 . the turn around for the second period enabled gloucester to secure possession . richards made ground before allen made the decisive half break to feed forrester who kicked ahead and just gathered the bouncing ball to score , 36 - 34 . gloucester back in the lead . irish were not done for , one score would win the game for them but everitt was off target with a long range drop goal attempt and a penalty . fate for once was on the side of the cherry and whites and victory was sweet . the european challenge cup maybe but a sideshow to the prestigious heineken cup but the wind and pouring rain plus the ridiculous early kick - off time were forgotten in the euphoric atmosphere of success . there were tears of joy in the raucous celebrations as peter buxton collected his second trophy of the season , a season which has seen the emergence of dean ryan 's ' gloucester club 18 - 30 ' . good game , great occasion plus endless excitement , finished up with handshakes all round from disappointed irish fans . memories are made of this and that makes the blood tingle just to have been there . roll on next season !_. _ _ where does graig farm meat come from ? in order to ensure that we know the entire history of each piece of meat which we sell , we have built up relationships with a group of farmers many of whom have been supplying us with animals for a number of years . a graig farm producers group meeting on a member 's farm in radnorshire " to expect the average farmer to be not only a sower and a reaper , but an agricultural chemist , an accountant , a meteorologist , a veterinary expert , a merchant , a financier and a resident housekeeper , all united in a single admirable chrichton is ridiculous ; yet this is our practice .

going back even further to 1685 it was home to huguenot silk weavers who fled from france because their protestant faith meant that they were under attack in a predominantly catholic country . the fragile building at 19 princelet street was originally a huguenot silk weavers house , then a jewish synagogue . a room above the synagogue became the home of its last eccentric caretaker until he disappeared in 1969 : the resdiscovery of the room in the 1980s is the subject of the book rodinsky 's room . now a museum of immigration and diversity , the house is only open for a handful of days each year : but it will be open every day during refugee week . grab your chance to see this extraordinary house . around the corner from the museum and along brick lane , you can see an original huguenot protestant church - now a mosque . the actor david garrick was descended from huguenots . you can see a scattering of objects about his life at the theatre museum . huguenots are no longer a distinguishable group , although the huguenot society of great britain still exists for those interested in , or descended from huguenots . a bust of madame deserrily who escaped the guillotine , but died from an illness aged 36 . courtesy of the trustees of the wallace collection . 1780 - 1900 a hundred years later it was french roman catholics and aristocrats who fled to britain , escaping from the french revolution . the wallace collection mostly consists of french objects , and has a number of things associated with this group of refugees . they include a picture of madamme perregaux by vigee le burn - both artist and sitter had fled to london from the revolution . there 's also a bust of madame de serilly ( an aristocrat who was a friend of louis xvi 's sister ) . she narrowly escaped the guillotine by pretending to be pregnant . a close up of the mural at the marx memorial library . photo : k smith . 1848 - 1880 from 1848 revolutions spread across europe , and radicals fled to britain . the marx memorial library contains a comprehensive record of the political ideals and beliefs of many of those who arrived in this country . named after karl marx , it also contains a room which lenin used to write political tracts whilst in exile in london . the small room still contains original furniture as well as busts of lenin . the upper room of the library itself is dominated by a 1930s allegorical mural of the rise of socialism . it shows the oppressed worker throwing off his chains , backed by sunrise , whilst leaders of the left including lenin , marx and william morris look on . highly idealised , it 's a beautiful piece of mural making , only restored fairly recently : a previous generation of library workers had mounted bookshelves over the top of it . you can join the library or visit on a day pass if you 'd like to browse the books . however , if you 'd just like to visit the building , then it is open to the general public at lunchtimes . a 19th century etching of russian jews fleeing the pogrom . courtesy of the jewish museum . 1880 -

grain breakfast cereals , weetabix , branflakes , shredded wheat , wholemeal or granary bread . high fibre foods add bulk to your diet , are filling and help to prevent constipation . try to include these foods in your diet every day . a healthy diet allows you to eat anything in moderation . however , some foods should not be eaten too often or in large quantities if you want to prevent weight gain . currently the british diet contains too much fat . there are two main types of fat : polyunsaturated , eg sunflower margarine , corn oil , and saturated fat , eg butter , fat on meat and fat in cheese etc . both types of fat are equally high in calories but polyunsaturated fat is better for your heart . try to cut down the total amount of fat that you eat and choose polyunsaturated rather than saturated fats . switch over to low fat sunflower margarines and avoid frying food ; grill , bake , or steam instead where possible . try low fat dairy products , eg semi - skimmed milk , low fat cheeses and low fat yogurts . sugar and sugary foods contain calories but little goodness . if you are gaining weight , try low calorie drinks and sugar free squashes and have fruit or yogurts for desserts rather than cakes or biscuits . as a dialysis patient you have probably cut down on salt in your diet . as salt may contribute to high blood pressure it is sensible to continue to use a little in cooking but avoid adding salt to food at the table . you can now enjoy a much greater variety of foods . a healthy diet does not mean that you should not enjoy the occasional treat . however , treats should be included as part of a balanced diet which contains starchy foods , fruits , vegetables , dairy products and meat or meat alternatives . there is plenty of information on healthy eating in supermarkets , health promotion centres , libraries , gp surgeries etc and many recipe books are available so enjoy your food . your dietician whilst you are in hospital you will be seen by the dietician . she will be able to advise you on your specific dietary requirements . some people lose a large amount of weight before their transplant and it may be necessary for them to supplement their diet with fortified drinks etc . you will be advised if these are recommended for you . following your transplant there are minimal restrictions to your diet . a healthy diet which is low in fat and sugar and high in fibre will help excessive weight gain and help you keep fit and healthy . the dietician will help you develop an eating plan that provides a balanced diet to meet your needs . the number of calories you will need will be based on whether you need to gain , maintain , or lose weight and on your level of activity . alcohol it is alright to drink alcohol in moderation after your transplant . grapefruit it is best to avoid eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice ( it interferes with the level of cyclosporin or tacrolimus in your blood ) . listeria it is important that during the first three months after a transplant you avoid eating foods that may contain � listeria � . this is a bacteria that can cause problems when you are taking higher doses of anti - rejection drugs . listeria is acquired from food and usually presents with no symptoms or , at most , very mild symptoms like flu with a temperature . headache , diarrhoea or a sore throat can also occur and a more serious infection can arise if the listeria spreads in the body . foods that may contain listeria include the following : unpasteurised cheese pate live yoghurt foods containing raw eggs eg . mayonnaise further information if you have any queries , please do not hesitate to contact your dietitian . department of nutrition and dietetics , tel : 01223 216655 , fax : 01223 216824_cd _ _ there 's nothing terribly original or elaborate about this -- but i find it a really useful starting point for getting non -- communicators to think about communicating . you simply work out which stakeholders and channels you have , decide which channels are appropriate for which stakeholders and then start thinking about key messages -- which you then put in the appropriate box ! casey leaver : 20 jun 2006 17:38 | tags : internal communications | comments ( 1 ) | close comments | report a problem please wait -

comments are loading march 29 , 2006 communicate -- facelift issues with communicate : distribution & frequency there a regular complaints from individuals in larger departments that they have not received the latest issue . e.g. the medical school , the business school & warwick hri . we are aware that hospitality , accommodation and cleaning services do not always distribute the copies that are sent to them . each department is asked how many copies they require and the requisite number of copies are enveloped up , addressed to the department ( not a named contact within it ) and sent through the internal mail . in addition copies are sent to porters in various buildings , retired staff , international representatives , lay members of committees , local press , other institutions ' communications departments and other local colleges . all in all about 7000 copies . communicate is published 7 times each academic year -- with extra special editions ( 2 for singapore alone , 1 for job evaluation etc . ) is this too infrequent -- does it mean it 's out of date before it hits people 's desks ? is this something we can solve through better integration with insite ? perhaps the publication dates could be reorganised so that they follow key committee meetings -- enabling us to put fresh news in . suggestions : named contacts in departments ? individually addressed copies ( cost may be prohibitive ) . content do people find the content useful ? what kind of content would people like ? does it present a true picture of the institution ? does it give any indication of the university 's direction/ key values ? is it newsy / relevant enough ? is there enough weight to it ? design & layout the template was last put out to tender in the summer of 2002 ( 31 issues ago ) -- the template tender was won by warwickprint and each edition ( excepting special editions such as the big picture ) is designed in - house by the communications office using quark . the template now seems restrictive , it was originally designed for a low word - count -- the idea being that articles would be written to measure . but now we find that we use a higher word count because the articles are more featurey than newsy and this means that some topics are given undue prominence -- i.e a whole page per article . we also have an issue with the quality of images -- often the only illustrations available are poor - quality photos of , for example : people standing in a line people shaking hands which add nothing to the publication and convey no further information . we have a particular problem with finding high quality images for the front page -- in the current design they have to be both striking and high resolution . in short -- we need to spend more of the budget on professional photography . we 'd also like to colour - code pages for each of the key content themes ( see below ) . what do we want to do ? make communicate more useful to staff members use communicate to give staff information about policy , strategy , values and direction deal with weightier items in features and news deal with the key themes of : research , region & community , employment issues , campus developments , teaching and learning , international developments , widening participation and outreach more by - lines more commissions longer articles student news more regular items : warwick people , bring back viewpoint , warwick in the newspapers better headlines & subbing newsier style for news list of grants awarded ? content ideas from former issues of communicate and other institutions ' publications include : vc in conversation with the su president spotlight on / focus on ( individuals / departments ) also in this edition ( on the front page ) topic guide at the top of each page introduction from the vc in each issue ? our wish list of topics and articles includes : more info about the medical school -- research / teaching / structure / developments / news international strategy post -

comments are loading case europe internal communications seminar writing about web page http://www.case.org/conferences/euro i went to a case europe seminar yesterday on internal communication . case is an organisation largely devoted to advancement . according to case advancement is : a systematic , integrated method of managing relationships in order to increase an educational institution 's support from its key outside constituents , including alumni and friends , government policy makers , the media , members of the community , and philanthropic entities of all types . for a few years now they have been getting increasingly interested in internal communications -- and looking at their definition of advancement you can see why -- internal comms is all about oiling the wheels and integrating systems within an organisation . good quality internal communications is fundamental to dealing with the outside world as a unified whole -- although i would argue that this is not it 's primary purpose . more on this later , i could cheerfully write screeds on this topic , but what i really wanted to talk about was the seminar itself . the thing that really struck me was the number of people there with internal communications in their job title . a few years ago , when i first became warwick 's internal comms officer , i only knew of two others in the whole sector -- yesterday there were 11 of us present and i know of more besides ! the really invigorating thing though is finding out that we are all at different stages of development -- but all working on similar things and facing similar issues . it 's easy to get demoralised from time to time and feel that you are going nowhere or worse moving backwards -- but getting together and exchanging experiences and advice showed that every institution has different strengths at the moment but that we are all trying to move in the same direction . some are strong on print , it communications -- others on management or face - to - face communication . people were very intrigued about blogs and their potential uses ! seminar programme overview of internal communications at eversheds -- howard krais ( icb consulting ) targetting staff communications by audience -- ellen ferrara ( bt ) communications audits at sheffield -- meg holmes ( sheffield ) student communications via print -- jenny gault ( goldsmiths ) creating informal networks -- jane penrose ( euro rscg riley ) moving staff comms online -- susie baker & pauline brown ( oxford brookes ) the sessions were all interesting and provided a useful starting point , but as usual the real benefit was in the discussion . ideas the big ideas that i 've taken away are : team briefing/ cascading briefing this is something that a group of us have been banging our heads up against for a while . it was interesting to hear how everyone else is progressing -- and actually we all seem to be at about the same stage : admin / central services pilot and communications skills training / communication responsibility in job descriptions for ( academic ) ' managers ' . crisis/ emergency communication scenario planning away days for senior management involving internal communications . staff satisfaction surveys i 'm going to email round for benchmark data from all those who are wiling to share it -- we really need to put our results into context . lateral communication encouraging lateral communication seemed to be a common issue , especially with the erosion of staff social space ( another common issue ) . ideas included : speed networking for staff with complimentary work areas / interests ! proliferation of newsletters the majority of institutions represented had a lot of internal publications sent by a variety of internal departments -- one idea to encourage high quality information and production was to create a ' best - practice network ' for individuals producing newsletters so people could advise each other on deadlines , content , design etc . to do list the other great thing about this kind of event is that it helps you to take a step back and reassess your work . here are a list of things which are either ongoing , or i 've wanted to do for ages and have n't got round to : refresh insite -- visual id , useability , ease of maintenance change the focus of communicate -- improve distribution , link more closely with institutional priorities , refresh design , integrate more closely with insite team briefings -- restart the push on team briefings community building -- pick up the work on lateral and social communication and activity again update the ic strategy concentrate on process -- helping people to find clear policies and guidelines management communication -- ( a ) spelling out direction ( b ) using managers at all levels of the organisation as communicators most of these things are big ideas ( and that 's only the short shortlist ) -- and as somebody said yesterday , the strapline for internal communicators ought to be : beg , borrow and steal . casey leaver : 22 mar 2006 12:42 | tags : internal communications warwick work | comments ( 0 ) | close comments | report a problem please wait -

what , why and how_wrb _ _ the muslim parliament - a historical background since its inception in 1992 the muslim parliament has concerned itself with the affairs of muslims in britain and abroad in a bold and forthright manner . it debates issues affecting islam and muslims , and champions their causes . community action on this level is only feasible because the parliament is an independent national forum on which all muslims , irrespective of denomination or racial origin , can meet to pursue their common objectives . the muslim parliament during its early days under the leadership of dr kalim siddiqui , whose brain - child the parliament was , opted for a high - profile , confrontational approach in its championing of islamic causes . the need for a ' muslim parliament ' arose out of the frustration felt at the time of the satanic verses controversy as well as a wider feeling that governmental and policy - making bodies were adopting indifferent and at times discriminatory policies toward muslim pre - occupations . the idea was instead to empower muslims with their separate and distinctly islamic institutions to meet their needs independently of the british government and local authorities . it also sought to discourage muslims from entering mainstream politics or even from voting in elections ; rather , the focus of debate was the need to create a " non - territorial islamic state " in britain . admittedly , many of the objectives the parliament had set itself were not met by the time of dr kalim siddiqui 's premature death in 1996 . its new leader dr ghayasuddin siddiqui ( no relation , but a close associate ) began to introduce reforms into how the muslim parliament was to operate and engage with its social and political environment . out went the ideologically - driven thinking and in came a more consensual , pragmatic modus operandi . predictably this led to disaffection in the ranks of dr kalim siddiqui 's more ideological followers , some of whom seceded to form separate groups . the muslim parliament held the view that muslim 's grievances were best met by building alliances with other muslim organisations , grass - root and national , and - a radical move at the time - with non - muslim groups entertaining similar welfare and civil rights objectives . a broader pro - justice movement was articulated , and dr ghayasuddin siddiqui was one of the first muslim leaders to work with and urge cooperation with dissident political parties , with groups concerned with justice , civil liberties and respect for the environment . this approach paid off in the aftermath of 9/11 , when harassment of the muslim individuals and groups created a wave of sympathy for what was widely perceived as a persecuted minority . dr siddiqui was closely involved in the formative stages of the stop the war coalition , which brought together muslims and opponents of the war from different parts of the british political spectrum ._. _ _ weekly , age -

and not just in northern ireland . however , although many of the specific questions that the report asked remain unanswered , there is now a considerable range of developments , researches , projects and government initiatives in the field of education and community relations in northern ireland . the original research was funded by the ford foundation , and it was carried out during the period 1976 - 77 . it described its purpose as an attempt to fill the gap between the wide general interest in the subject of integrated schooling in northern ireland and the shortage of information about segregated schools , and it justified this with the view that ' as any survey of educational research in northern ireland will demonstrate , a researcher might enter the topic of segregated schooling at any of a dozen different points , and find a clear field in most of them . ' since then there has been , and continues to be , a great deal of activity in this area , some of which would have been thought highly unlikely in 1977 . the highlights of this include the recent fairly dramatic growth in the number of integrated schools , the decision to introduce legislation which will place ' a statutory responsibility on the department of education to encourage integrated education ' , and the emergence of a strong commitment at all levels to the promotion of ' education for mutual understanding ' ( emu ) . the second report , which is also reprinted here , called schools together ? , was published in 1984 , and built on the work of schools apart ? the delay between the two was caused by an inability to interest any funder in continuing with this work , until the department of education , prompted by the enthusiasm of donald davidson , agreed to remedy this in 1982 . this second work examined links between schools across northern ireland 's sectarian divide and concluded that there were very few such links of any importance since the conclusion of the schools together ? research a third project has been completed . this involved a new emphasis on research and development and included a collaboration between the department of education , the western education and library board , and the centre for the study of conflict . this project was a deliberately interventionist attempt to generate a set of detailed and permanent links among all the primary and all the secondary schools in one particular community . the report on the first two year stage of this , the third in this series , has been published recently as inter school links . copies are available ( � 4.00 ) from the centre for the study of conflict . john darby seamus dunn march 1989 . return to publication contents education and community in northern ireland schools apart ? preface this research is an attempt to fill the gap between the wide general interest in the subject of integrated schooling in northern ireland and the shortage of information about segregated schools . to what extent are roman catholic and protestant children educated separately ? how different are the schools which they attend ? what sort of contacts are there between them ? how do principals and teachers regard the schools attended by the other religious group ? these are some of the questions which it was designed to examine . social and educational research are difficult in any circumstances . in northern ireland there are extra sensitivities which complicate any investigation of protestant and catholic schools . not the least of these is determining how the schools should be described , since the official designations ' controlled schools ' , ' maintained schools ' and ' voluntary schools ' are not entirely synonymous with the central religious divide . for this reason schools participating in the project which were attended predominantly by protestant children were designated category a schools , and those attended mainly by catholic children were named category b schools ; this device was maintained during the first phase of the project . however , in the more illuminative approach adopted in the triangle report the terms became almost impossibly cumbersome and confusing . it became necessary to adopt the shorthand terms ' protestant ' and ' roman catholic ' schools . this was done solely for ease of reading , and we apologise for any offence it may cause . our gratitude is due to the ford foundation which funded the project , and especially to john white . our sincere thanks are particularly due to the principals , teachers , parents and committee members in the triangle area , and to the principals who participated in the questionnaire . finally , we are grateful to the north - eastern education and library board , which permitted access to their schools . j.darby d. murray d. batts s. dunn s. farren j. harris november , 1977 return to publication contents aims social research , unlike some physical research , more often leads to a growing respect for the difficulties and complexities of a problem than to its solution . rather than stripping away layer after layer until an answer is reached , it is a case of each new piece of information revealing even greater possibilities and confusion . a study of northern ireland 's denominational education system and its social effects similarly leads to a recognition of its complexity rather than clarity . for this reason it is appropriate to begin this research report by recording what the project was not attempting to achieve before going to a definition of its objectives . as any survey of educational research in northern ireland will demonstrate , a researcher might enter the topic of segregated schooling at any of a dozen different points , and find a clear field in most of them . limited resources demand the establishment of priorities , and such exercises are necessarily subjective . any number of projects might have been justified : an assessment of the specific relationship between segregated schools and intolerant community attitudes among children , either by a longitudinal study or by attempting to isolate extra - mural influences , would clearly be an important contribution ; so would a study of the school 's role as a socialising institution in a divided society ; it might also be argued that a more positive attempt to improve inter - schools relations or to conduct experimental projects in integrated schooling is badly needed . it is undeniable that these , and some other projects , would promote a better understanding of the relationship between segregated schools and community conflict , and indeed are fundamental to such an understanding . nevertheless , considering the limited resources and the need to determine priorities , it was agreed that such projects should follow rather than precede a more basic examination of the existing similarities and differences between the learning experiences of protestant and catholic children in the province , and the project was shaped in that direction . implicit in the arguments of both sides in the debate about segregated schooling is the belief that there is a real difference in the experiences undergone by catholic and protestant children within their denominational schools . the roman catholic case for retaining their schools rests on a conviction that they provide a religio - moral ethos which is integral to catholic education . those opposed to segregation usually base their case on the belief that separate schools encourage divisiveness by propagating different and perhaps hostile cultural heritages . both these stances are premised on the conviction that schools attended by protestant and catholic children are significantly different sorts of institutions , and that different activities are practised within them . laying aside for a moment the fact that even the extent of denominationalism is unknown , no investigation has ever been conducted into the similarities and differences in practices within the two sets of schools . there is no knowledge of a systematic nature about their disciplinary practices , the functions of their principals , their extra - curricular contacts , in fact about the bread - and - butter organisations of the schools . it would appear likely that the general wooliness which has characterised the segregation debate is not unrelated to simple ignorance of practices within the segregated system . it may indeed be the case that the very lack of research on the differences actually perpetuates and exaggerates the perceived differences themselves . this conviction that the differences and similarities must be carefully investigated has directed our research activities at every stage of the project , and led to the decision to concentrate the study on the learning experiences of catholic and protestant school - children within the existing segregated school systems . the main aim of the project , therefore , was to compare and contrast the operation of the two categories of schools by examining their managements committees , their disciplinary structures and their curricular and extra - curricular practices . there is always a problem of scope with such investigations . at one end of the spectrum it might be argued that , with limited resources , only an intensive study of a single school could provide a real understanding of the dynamics of school life ; at the other extreme is the view that such a restricted study would only have limited general applicability , and would give the element of interaction between schools in an area , and between schools and their community . the strategy which we adopted was to select a geographical unit - the triangle area in the north coast of ireland bounded by the towns of portrush , portstewart and coleraine - and to conduct interviews at every level of decision - making within all 19 schools . to allow comparisons between the triangle area and the rest of northern ireland the interviews were preceded by a questionnaire which was distributed to a stratified sample of primary and secondary schools throughout northern ireland . it is hoped that the research findings will perform three functions : that they will fill some of the more acute gaps in the basic data which underpin the debate on segregated schooling ; that they will contribute positively to the debate by permitting an assessment of the significance of denominational schooling , and by locating more precisely those aspects of the educational system which are most crucial to community relations ; and that they will construct a platform upon which further systematic studies might be constructed . return to publication contents chapter 6 : summary and conclusions ( a ) roman catholic and protestant schools ? the main purpose of this research project was to compare the schools which are attended predominantly by protestant children with those attended by catholics . the problem is that there are no legally designated ' protestant schools ' or ' roman catholic schools ' in northern ireland , and that some people take exception to the use of these terms . it is nevertheless true that a number of factors indicate the existence of separate denominational school systems . the most obvious of these is the high level of denominationalism among both pupils and teachers . in 71 % of the schools responding to the education and community questionnaire all the children came from only one of the two major religious groupings , and only one school in thirty - three had more than 5 % of their pupils from a religious minority group . the teaching profession was even more polarised : only 41 of the 2,751 teachers from responding schools ( 1.5 % ) taught in schools where they were in a religious minority . this high level of denominationalism among school pupils and teachers is reinforced by the roles adopted by clergy within schools . it is true that in all categories of schools clerics and clerical nominees represent a substantial force on management committees - in the triangle area they constitute well over half the total membership , but in no case did a clergyman or his nominee cross the religious barrier and sit on a committee where religious persuasion formed a minority . when it came to visiting schools , clergymen demonstrated a very accurate ability to define schools primarily in religious terms ; their visits to schools were frequent but rarely crossed the central religious divide . perhaps the most convincing demonstration of the existence of denominational school systems , at least in primary education , is its acceptance by the education and library boards , which administer the system . since few people in northern ireland would deny that some schools are overtly catholic , it is not surprising that the boards deal directly with the roman catholic church when a new maintained ( i.e. roman catholic ) primary school is being planned . less well - known , perhaps , is that when a new controlled primary school - a state school entirely financed from public funds - has been built , the protestant churches are asked to contribute nominees to its management committee , but the roman catholic church is not . it is , of course , possible that the roman catholic clergy would not wish to be consulted . that they are not , however , demonstrates an acceptance that controlled primary schools are de facto protestant schools , and acknowledged as such by statutory bodies . add to these arguments - the denominational polarisation of pupils and staffs , the preponderance of denominational interests on management committees , and the acceptance of the existence of protestant schools by area boards - the awareness among the parents interviewed during this project that schools were essentially separated on the basis of religion , and there is a considerable body of evidence to support the existence of denominational schools . the next step is to examine the differences between them . ( b ) how different ? how similar ? some of the structural differences between protestant and roman catholic schools have already been noted , notably the strong denominational bias among pupils and teachers . the operational differences , as demonstrated in the education and community study , appear to be concentrated in school management , school - home relationships and , to a lesser degree , discipline . the main difference in the management of protestant and roman catholic schools lies in the membership of their management committees . in particular , protestant management committees are more representative of non - clerical influences . very few northern irish schools have any teachers on their management committees , but those which do are almost invariably protestant . similarly with parents : it is true that those protestant schools which are controlled are obliged by law to have parental representatives on their committees , but it is also true that very few roman catholic schools have specific parents ' representatives . to some extent this pattern is repeated in the broader issue of school - home relationships . in northern ireland in general and the triangle area in particular protestant schools were much more likely to have parents ' or parent - teacher associations . such formal relationships were not so popular in catholic schools , although catholic principals often stressed the relatively greater value of informal contacts with parents outside church on sundays or in the course of preparing children for the sacraments . it may indeed be the case that it is easier to establish such contacts in the single - denominational roman catholic schools than in protestant schools , where there may be three large denominational groupings . regarding the exercise of discipline , the questionnaire returns demonstrated a greater tendency in roman catholic schools throughout northern ireland to adopt ' high level ' disciplinary controls ; they were more likely to use corporal punishment and to suspend pupils . the more detailed triangle interviews , however , produced a rather different picture . here both catholic and protestant schools practised corporal punishment , and no difference in emphasis was discernible . the questionnaire returns also showed that pupils were more often formally involved in the running of protestant schools , as prefects or holding some other office . it is interesting that all these observed differences between the two school systems are associated with a higher level of formal procedures in protestant schools , and a tendency towards more unstructured systems in catholic schools . opinions about the significance of these differences will , of course , vary , but it is important to evaluate them within the context of the many similarities between the two sets of schools in their day - to - day procedures . in both school systems the educational qualifications of teachers were roughly similar ; the work profiles of principals - how much they taught , the proportion of their time spent interviewing parents or in administration etc . - were almost indistinguishable ; most classroom practices too are common to both systems - they stream pupils to similar extents and are equally likely to practice some form of integration within the curriculum . in addition to these similarities , principals and teachers may be interested to know that their opposition to increased parental involvement in schools and their reluctance to involve pupils in community projects is also shared by their colleagues across the religious divide . more interesting , however , is the evidence of an acceptance by both school systems of some elements of a shared heritage . this covers quite a wide spectrum of school activities . school broadcasts and project materials , many of which deal with such value - laden areas as religion and history , are , with very minor differences , used widely by schools of both religions . the stereotyped picture of a strict split between catholic sports like gaelic football , hurling and camogie in roman catholic schools and protestant sports like hockey , cricket and rugby in protestant schools is far from accurate . while these sports rarely cross the religious divide , it is important to note that they are practised in only a minority of schools . equally significant is the existence of a third group of sports which are popular in both protestant and catholic schools and which provide opportunities for frequent contact between them , sports like basketball , soccer and netball . finally the notion that patterns of visits by pupils to places outside the schools might reveal different perceptions about cultural loyalties was not supported by the evidence . the irish republic and britain were visited with similar frequency ( or infrequency ) by both sets of schools , although protestant schools were more likely to visit the continent ; and the popularity of such venues within northern ireland as the ulster folk museum , the ulster museum and the ulster transport museum is of sufficient high level in all schools to suggest the existence of a shared ulster culture . while the project was directed towards an examination of the similarities and differences between protestant and roman catholic schools , it is important to consider these in relation to other differences within the education system . other variables emerged which cut across the religious one and which were more influential in explaining some differences between different types of schools . one of these was the secondary - level division between grammar and secondary schools ; the greater frequency of ex - pupils ' associations and graduate teachers . for example , was more marked in both catholic and protestant grammar schools than in secondary schools . an even more significant influence , however , was the dominance of the principal within both categories of schools . it is true that management committees , by selecting the principal , have considerable influence in determining the sort of person they wish to run their schools . it is also true , that , having been appointed , the principal soon becomes the major determinant of school policy . the management committee , which meets infrequently and usually confines its consideration to financial matters and appointments , rarely interferes in the school 's day - to - day affairs . it also appears that staff meetings are not regarded , even by principals and teachers , as an important decision - making arena . while there is some variety between schools , most school principals regard themselves as the makers of decisions about the running of the school , and most teachers accept this situation . ( c ) contact between the schools it is clear that there are considerable similarities in the day - to - day running of protestant and roman catholic schools in northern ireland , but the very existence of two systems throughout the province presents a difficult question . does the very fact of separation encourage mutual ignorance and suspicion and help to polarise attitudes ? the answer , while outside the scope of this project , partly depends on the extent to which schools ensure that contact takes place across the religious divide . the questionnaire returns revealed the existence of a high number of schools in northern ireland which claimed to have virtually no contacts at all with any other schools , even those within their own religious grouping . almost a third of the responding schools did not engage in joint activities with another school , and the sharing of school facilities was minimal . the triangle study , however , revealed some interesting differences . in the first place the level of joint activities was nigh . pupils meet each other regularly when playing soccer , netball and other sports , and joint sports days , carol services , school outings , debating and cultural activities are quite common . indeed , these activities appear in some respects to be more common between schools of different religions than within each religious group . this was particularly striking at primary level , where there was a marked tendency for some neighbouring protestant and roman catholic schools to establish a special relationship . the characteristics of these twinned schools ' are close administrative liaison , joint recreational and cultural activities and , often , unusually close relationships between the principals . the key to this relationship appears to lie in a shared sense of community , even though the schools served different religious segments of it . nevertheless it seems unlikely that it could have developed without a deliberate decision by the principals to ensure that pupils of different religions have at least occasional opportunities to meet each other . this concern about the possible anti - social effects of segregation was significantly more marked among principals than among assistant teachers . the most interesting explanation of this anomaly was suggested by one of the principals . he claimed that he and the other principals from the area , unlike the teachers , were in constant contact through administrative necessity and membership of common committees , and that the relationships thus established served to reduce suspicion and increase tolerance and co - operation . it is true that such close contacts between teachers were much less frequent than between their principals . no attempt was made in the project to examine the relationship between levels of cross - religious contact and levels of tolerance , so it would be premature to read too much into the suggested connection . nevertheless the fact that a connection was perceived at all is interesting in itself . all this adds up to a picture of much closer relationships in the triangle area than was apparent from the questionnaire returns from all over northern ireland . ( d ) religion in the schools the high level of denominationalism in school populations is reflected in the religious practices and procedures of schools . the prominence of clergy in the schools , by virtue of their membership of management committees and visits to schools , has already been noted . the questionnaire returns also demonstrate a high level of religious orthodoxy in all schools . common religious education classes is the norm for all pupils in both roman catholic and protestant schools ; only 9.9 % of the responding schools indicated that any pupils opted out of these classes , and in only one school did the number of pupils opting out exceed 5 % of the population . this general picture was confirmed in all respects in the triangle study . within both systems conformity of religious practices is high . in addition to these formal and measurable religious activities , however , it has been claimed that a major justification of separate catholic schools is the peculiarly catholic ethos or character which pervades them , although no one claimed a similar quality for protestant schools . it was not part of the research design to examine this question , but the frequency with which it was raised by teachers was striking . a considerable majority of both protestant and roman catholic teachers , when commenting on the differences between the two groups of schools , focused on the role of religion in catholic schools . the difference between them was that , while protestant teachers emphasised the level of clerical control exercised by the roman catholic church , catholic teachers frequently commented favourably on the catholic moral ethos which distinguished their schools . no catholic teacher was able to describe this ethos , but many were convinced of its existence . since catholic teachers admitted almost complete ignorance of how protestant schools operated , and hence had little basis upon which to claim peculiarity for their own schools , this would appear to be a key area for further research . ( e ) as others see us as the interviews in the triangle area proceeded during the project , increasing emphasis was placed on the perceptions of principals , teachers and parents rather than on the more objective and more easily assembled data on the operation of schools . three interconnected conclusions emerged from these interviews . there is a high level of mutual ignorance about the two sets of schools . since it is relatively rare for protestant teachers to teach in catholic schools , and vice versa , virtually nothing is known at first hand about the day - to - day running of the other school system . there was also a degree of mutual suspicion , emerging in part at least from ignorance . protestant teachers , for example , were suspicious of the influence of the catholic clergy in schools , and catholic teachers sometimes opposed integration , because it was regarded as a euphemism for a take - over of catholic schools . more significant , perhaps , was the tendency for catholic teachers to apply less favourable stereotypes to protestant schools than protestant teachers did to catholic schools . from protestant teachers references to ' priest - ridden ' institutions were the most severe criticisms applied to catholic schools . catholic teachers , however , regarded protestant schools as cold ' , ' rigid ' , examination orientated and unfriendly . whether or not these judgements are accurate is another matter . the point is that they were made by the same teachers who had earlier professed almost complete ignorance of protestant schools . the third characteristic of the interviews with principals and teachers was a very high level of concern about the possible consequences of segregated schooling . this applied to both roman catholic and protestant schools . however this concern about the effects of division did not always extend into advocacy of immediate integrated schooling . catholic teachers were sometimes apprehensive about its possible effects on their schools , and even the most enthusiastic integrationist recognised the problems inherent in its introduction , and only saw it as a long term prospect . but , regardless of what views were expressed about the feasibility of integration , the almost universal expressions of concern about the separate education of protestant and roman catholic children was perhaps the most expressive factor to emerge from the interviews with principals and teachers . ( f ) implications it is important to preface any remarks about the implications of the education and community project by indicating its thresholds . for example , it was not possible to observe teachers and pupils during classes in the course of the project , so any assessment of classroom influences must be circumspect . again , as the interview - based phase of the study , which discovered some of the more subtle relationships between roman catholic and protestant schools , was restricted to the eighteen participating schools in the triangle area , it is difficult to assess the extent to which its findings might apply more generally to other parts of the province . the questionnaire returns provide general guidance in this respect , but they can not illuminate the more subtle community interactions . what then can be said about schools in northern ireland ? the first point is that simplistic generalities about integration of roman catholic and protestant schools are inappropriate and inaccurate . whether from conviction or pragmatism , the great majority of teachers believe that it is quite impossible to envisage it in the immediate future . within the divided system , however , the similarities between the two sets of schools in their day - to - day operations are considerably more conspicuous than the differences and , in the triangle area at any rate , contact between schools across the religious divide is high . even in the triangle , however , where community relationships are good , teachers were concerned about the institutional split between roman catholic and protestant children . more constructively , this concern was frequently expressed in a willingness to improve relationships within the existing systems . the main implication of the education and community study is that , whether one favours integration or not , the emphasis in the foreseeable future should be on establishing more fruitful and constructive relationships within and between the two sets of schools . there are a number of ways in which this might be advanced . it is clear that a number of useful points of contact already exist . these are often in the competitive setting of the sports field . this is , of course , in the very nature of inter - school contacts , but care is required to ensure that children may meet in co - operative as well as competitive settings . the special relationships discovered between neighbouring ' twinned schools ' of different religions may suggest that , in some small communities at least , they might become vehicles for encouraging further co - operation . there is a case , for example , for establishing common local history resource centres or encouraging joint community projects which emphasise common rather than sectarian loyalties . indeed the question of teacher exchange a primary level , if only on a limited scale , is also a matter for consideration . teachers ' centres too might be encouraged to investigate the possibility of adopting a social and recreational role , if local teachers express a desire for this . regardless of its cross - religious implications , there was a suggestion from the interviews that their function was too limited . in curriculum affairs there is also a surprisingly high level of cooperation . both the new university of ulster and the queen 's university of belfast are involved in development projects in schools , which not only emphasise the common environment shared by both roman catholics and protestant children in northern ireland , but are evolving teaching materials and approaches in the general curricular area of social studies and the humanities . perhaps more remarkable is the acceptance of a common religious education curriculum in the northern ireland g.c.e. syllabus . the subject which still excites most emotion is history , and there is a case for building on the work started by the northern ireland public records office and producing history - teaching materials , including textbooks , which focus on northern ireland and local studies and which would be acceptable in all schools . the initiative for such a move might come from the inspectorate , the g.c.e. history panel or history teachers themselves . the project suggests that the atmosphere may be right for an initiative . the willingness to improve relationships between schools also had administrative implications . in june 1977 lord melchett , the minister responsible for education in northern ireland . established the principle that ' reorganisation ( i.e. of secondary schools ) should not create or perpetuate barriers against integrated education ' . this is clearly a welcome , though negative , attempt to prevent the two systems drawing further apart . the level of concern expressed by teachers about the effects of segregation suggests the need for a more positive lead in the direction of cooperation and closer relationships . for example , there are indications that nursery education and sixth - form education - the two age groups on the boundaries of compulsory schooling - offer specific possibilities for common education . attitudes appear to be less intransigent at these levels than at primary or secondary levels . segregation in nursery schools has not yet become institutionalised , although there are signs that it is moving in that direction . sixth forms are currently segregated , but the debate on comprehensive education has suggested quite a high level of flexibility from the churches , and a willingness to discuss the possibility of integrated sixth - form colleges in some districts . it is likely that , in the absence of a positive initiative to prevent it , both these segments of the education system will drift , through a combination of tradition and inertia , towards more rigid denominationalism . it is not suggested that this initiative should be generally applied . indeed , just as it is accepted that a uniformly imposed model of comprehensive schooling would be inappropriate to northern ireland 's circumstances , so any move to moderate the effects of the present high level of denominationalism must take account of both regional variations and the varying levels of segregation which exist at the different stages of a child 's education . whatever type of initiative is introduced , it must be accompanied by research and development projects . it is important to establish whether the relatively close contacts between schools in the triangle are a consequence of the area 's good community relations or its demographic structure . it is important to discover whether this picture is peculiar to the triangle , or operates in many other parts of the province . however , there is enough encouragement in the education and community study to suggest the introduction of experimental projects in particular areas which would build on existing relationships and explore means of improving them . the time is appropriate for an initiative by the department of education which takes notice of the concerns expressed by the teachers in the survey , and supports efforts whereby they may be advanced . return to publication contents schools together ? foreword the problems of northern ireland are not amenable to simple solutions and must be examined and understood from a number of positions and in a number of contexts . this research report looks closely at an area of growing interest and concern , that is the contribution that the two schools systems might make to the promotion of inter - community understanding and co - operation . the report builds to some extent on an earlier research published as ' schools apart ? ' , and two of the authors of that work are associated with this new report . the major findings of the first report were : most schools are in fact segregated on religious lines . the two sets of schools are very much alike in many significant ways . many schools have no contact at all with schools of the opposite religion . in the particular region investigated there was some evidence that neighbouring primary schools often developed a close relationship referred to by the report as ' twinning ' there was a high level of mutual ignorance about the two sets of schools . there was a high level of concern about the possible consequences of segregated schooling . there was an acceptance that integrated education was not a likely option in the foreseeable future . this report is made up of this foreword , five chapters and a set of appendices . chapter one introduces the project and sets the scene ; chapters two and three contain descriptions of the data collected ; chapter four is an analysis of this data ; and chapter five is a short summary of recommendations for action . the appendices contain a short report on the activities in this area being carried out by other bodies , and a set of case studies of some projects that have taken place or are currently taking place . we are grateful to mary connolly , donna breen , vivian kerr and joe mccormack for providing us with these appendices since they provide a set of interesting and contrasting examples of ways in which progress can be made . the report does not include a literature or research survey . this was a decision made in order to try to keep the report as short as possible . however such a survey has been written and a copy can be had from the authors . our thanks are due to the department of education northern ireland , who provided the funding , and in particular to donald davidson for all his help and advice . in order to ensure that we had access to counsel and help from as many interested groups as possible a liaison committee was established with the following membership : donald davidson , deni . vivian mclver , deni . victor carson , education and library boards . david stevens , irish council of churches . very reverend dean mclarnon , maintained schools commission . eric wood , south eastern area education and library board . robert ballagh , pace . this committee met regularly and we are extremely grateful to all members for their time and patience and help . finally our thanks are due to dorothy dallas for her expertise with the word - processor . return to publication contents background and methodology introduction in northern ireland there are two quite distinct sets of schools with differing managerial systems and almost completely separate constituencies . this separation arose from the desire of the churches to control their own schools . for ease of discussion , and because it is true in practical terms , we will refer to these as catholic schools and protestant schools , although officially they are called maintained schools and controlled schools . ( this picture is complicated slightly by the existence of a third set of voluntary , mainly grammar , schools some of which are catholic and some protestant ) . however , because of the peculiar overlap in northern ireland between religion and politics , this separation is often thought to have consequences that are not simply religious . in particular the relationship between this dual system and the general community life of the province is repeatedly raised . this often takes the form of a claim that an integration of the two systems would help to integrate the communities and so help to reduce conflict . the extent to which this claim is true is probably impossible to decide , finally , but the discussion is hampered by the fact that there have been very few attempts by social scientists to investigate the issue in any systematic way . as might be expected this lack of evidence one way or the other has not been an effective barrier to comment or political rhetoric , or even to attempts at intervention : but the shortage of studies continues to be an obstacle to a more effective understanding of the problem . schools apart in 1977 the report ' schools apart ' ( darby , j. et al.,(1 ) ) was published . this was a research paper based on a project funded by the ford foundation and carried out at the new university of ulster . the research had two main strategies . the first was to collect information about the complete school system in the province , using a postal questionnaire and a stratified random sample of schools . the second was to look in some detail at one single geographical unit within the province , and to conduct interviews with as many people as possible from all levels of the educational system within this unit . the first strategy allowed the research to fill gaps in the basic data about the system , and , for example , made it clear that there was little or no overlap between the two sets of schools . the second strategy involved an examination of the degree and level of relationships between the two school systems within one defined community . among other intentions , it was hoped that this work would construct a platform upon which further systematic studies might be built . aims of this research the research which this paper reports began in january , 1983 . its first and most general purpose was to design and carry out an empirical field - study into relationships among schools within northern ireland 's segregated educational system . it was designed to build on and develop from the insights and themes uncovered by ' schools apart ? ' . for this reason it is called ' schools together ? ' , and two of the authors of the earlier report are also associated with this one . schools apart had described two relevant and important points of view about northern ireland 's schools . the first was " a very high level of concern about the possible consequences of segregated schooling"(p 73 ) ; the second was that integrated education was not a likely or even a possible option in the foreseeable future . the consequence of the coexistence of these two views was , we felt , that concern about the effects of segregation should begin with the actual existence of two sets of schools , accept them as such , and try to develop strategies for examining and encouraging co - operation between them . since it appeared that integration was unlikely , this approach might begin to ameliorate the social effects of separation . in order to do this effectively research was needed into existing patterns of co - operation among schools . the mechanism of inter - school relationships was therefore a main concern of the research . it was our hope that we could consider a variety of questions relating to a large number of variables within the system . these included the role of the various individuals and bodies crucially involved with schools such as teachers , principals , parents , management committees , and so on . we also wished to examine the role of other community institutions which overlapped with , or had close relations with , the educational system . finally we wished to try to be clear about the possible roles of government and of local authority in this area . methodology the methodology used in schools apart had two main strategies . the first involved a postal questionnaire to a large sample of northern ireland schools : the second was a close and detailed study of all the schools in one community . in the end it was clear that the community study aspect had been the more valuable part of the work . the schools apart study had two limitations : ( a ) only one community in one area was examined . it was clear that there was a need to repeat the research , in a developed way , in a number of other areas in northern ireland . the choice of these would try to take account of obviously important regional variables such as urban - rural , religion , level of experienced violence , and closeness to the border . ( b ) it was not specifically designed to look at levels of co - operation , inter - school relationships , and all the other issues arising from these . this research on the other hand , while building on the insights of the previous work , would specifically set out to examine these relationships . the main research instrument to be used was the semi - structured interview , which had proved its appropriateness in the schools apart study . a number of interview schedules were prepared for specific target groups including school principals , teachers , parents , school - governors , and representatives of other community institutions . they were constructed in such a way that , while ensuring that the necessary range of issues was covered , they were also flexible enough to allow for the emergence of unexpected ones . it was also necessary to use , on a local basis , a variety of short questionnaires and check - lists so that background information could be recorded efficiently . return to publication contents chapter 5 : conclusions and recommendations conclusions this research has helped to identify some of the conditions and practices which encourage or prevent closer inter - school co - operation . these may be summarised briefly . ( a ) in all four districts examined , the level of contact between schools was low . the insularity applied within the two religious groups as well as between them , and reflects the nature of institutions as well as sectarian suspicion . grammar schools were more likely to co - operate than any other category of schools . ( b ) as in the earlier ' schools apart ? ' project , teachers were almost unanimous in expressing concern for the effects of educational divisions and support for closer co - operation between catholic and protestant schools . ( c ) there was widespread ignorance about how closer co - operation might be accomplished . ( d ) the cutback in educational spending was often regarded as one of the more serious obstacles to initiating programmes of co - operation . ( e ) the time is propitious for encouraging educational co - operation : teachers are willing to become involved ; the department of education has been supportive ; the area boards have recently become active , and two have already developed a policy on the matter ; the niced primary guidelines , and the 11 - 16 review are going on at primary and secondary levels . all of this suggests that circumstances have rarely been more promising for an initiative to improve co - operation between schools . recommendations to convert these promising circumstances into action the following recommendations are made : 1 . raise consciousness . the research data suggests strongly that many teachers are open to encouragement towards co - operation , but lack the expertise and resources . the interviews by our researcher were themselves sufficient to promote initiatives between schools in two of the four districts under study . the more systematic provision of information on how to initiate projects , would be likely to encourage activity . some examples of the kind of information that might be provided is given in the appendix of this report . 2 . encourage co - operation consciousness raising would have a limited effect without a more determined initiative . while our research was an unconscious catalyst , consideration should be given to how such an effect might be achieved consciously . the research suggests the need for help on two fronts . first the provision of written material such as guidelines and regular news - bulletins containing case - histories , suggestions for action , advice about how to begin , warnings about pitfalls , and so on . this might be done through niced , and some subject committees might be encouraged to build in a community relations dimension to the curriculum reviews . second the provision of resources , mainly in the form of manpower , but also for such expressed needs as transport . the secondment of teachers through the area boards and maintained schools committee , funded by the department , might be one means of achieving this . as well , where schools propose a program of regular co - operation this should be reflected in their staffing allocation . 3 . a process for encouraging co - operation . a process should be established by which different elements in the educational process - deni , area boards , the churches , teachers , parents , and others - can contribute towards the longer term encouragement of co - operation . a single research project and its recommendations will have little effect on practice . our recommendation therefore is that the department of education assume responsibility for the initiation and overall management of a more structured and long - term system of encouragement and enablement of inter - school , and in - school , co - operation . 4 . an experiment in cooperation it must be stressed that this project had limited and modest objectives . its main aim was to chart and review the extent and forms of cooperation between schools in four districts within the province . there was no intention to try to encourage schools to co - operate , nor to affect their behaviour in any way . nevertheless , as with all interview - based research , some unexpected findings emerged . one of these was the high level of interest in school cooperation which was expressed by teachers in all districts . another was the evidence that this interest was more than rhetorical . the very arrival of our researcher into schools , asking questions about the frequency and forms of cross - schools contact , was enough to spark off at least two projects between schools in two different towns . this combination of concern among teachers and the incidental effect of consciousness being raised by an external catalyst provides a very promising springboard for examining ways in which cross - religious cooperation might be encouraged . motivation among teachers is high , but is frustrated by the pressures of the timetable and scarce resources . the time is right for an initiative which sets out deliberately to encourage the latent interest which has been identified in this study . our final proposal is : that two teachers are seconded by one of the area boards for the exclusive task of encouraging cross - religious cooperation between schools ; that their work should be carefully monitored to assess its effects ; that all the area boards and the department of education should support the project as an experiment ; that extra resources should be provided - particularly in the provision of transport and computing facilities - to support the operation ; and that the funding and expertise for the project should be jointly provided from government , the university and outside funding bodies . return to publication contents � centre for the study of conflict and the author(s ) last modified by martin melaugh : back to the top of this page_nn _ _ someone jewish for lisa you would have thought that with a greatest hits album and her own tv show , dallas ' finest jewish songstress lisa loeb would be very happy . well , she is - sort off , but in the love stakes , she is looking to improve on and is looking for someone jewish . jewish dating goes big someonejewish.com , the uk 's premium online jewish dating service has kicked off the new year with the placing of the biggest poster promoting something jewish in recent years . the someonejewish 48 sheet poster is located in north west london . jewish dating a new online jewish dating service that allows people to find , meet and schmooze with other jewish singles has gone live . someonejewish , is aimed at all sections of the jewish community who are looking for their special someone . jewish online dating are you single & jewish ? visit jewishdating.co.uk to view 1000s of fabulous uk singles . jewishdating.co.uk is powered by jdate.com , the most popular jewish online personals community . look for dates in the uk because love & romance are just a click away . online dating etiquette these days , people are logging on to the web for everything from banking and business to shopping and love , and with this surge in online activity , we 've seen a whole new code of manners emerge . find out all about online dating etiquette ._. _ _ could there be a science of consciousness ? david papineau birkbeck college 16 october 2001 1 . introduction . let me assume without argument : ( i ) conscious properties are material properties ( ie either strictly physical properties or physically realized higher properties ) . ( the cost of denying this is epiphenomenalism . ) ( ii ) nevertheless we have two kinds of concepts for thinking about these properties : phenomenal concepts ( which involve introspection or imagination ) and material concepts ( which do n't ) . ( � ontological monism , but conceptual dualism ' . block calls this � inflationist ' materialism . ) ( iii ) consciousness research aims to identify the material referents of phenomenal concepts . you can think of this as � hard problem ' research , in chalmers ' sense . ( nb there is a determinable phenomenal concept consciousness - as - such , in addition to the determinates like pain , seeing an elephant , and so on . ) ( iv ) consciousness research hinges crucially on subjects ' phenomenal reports about past and present experiences . to see this , note how such research is impossible with monkeys , say . 2 . summary . at first , identifying the material referents of phenomenal concepts might seem like a standard scientific problem . we have a pre - theoretically identified data - base , and we look for some material property peculiar to these cases . but it turns out there are too many such properties � which the standard methodology ca n't decide between . ned block says this indecision is the achilles ' heel of conceptual dualism ( � the harder problem of consciousness ' ) . i say this indecision arises only because phenomenal concepts are vague . 3 . too many properties . we are looking for a material property m which is identical with phenomenal property p ( eg pain , smelling a rose , seeing an elephant ) . so m must ( a ) be present whenever p is reported ( otherwise it is unnecessary for p ) , and ( b ) absent whenever p is denied ( otherwise it is insufficient ) . empirical research can dismiss many candidate ms as violating one or the other of these constraints . but we will still be left with too many candidates . most familiarly , if some strictly physical s coincides with p in humans , so will some structural f. ca n't we get more varied data , to discriminate ? thus cases with f but without s � a silicon doppelganger , say . but the methodology breaks down here . the doppelganger will certainly say � i 'm p' � but we wo n't know whether � p ' in its mouth refers to our experience p or not . so our methodology is impotent to decide whether f or s is the material referent of � p ' . similar problems arise with deciding whether � p ' refers to a broad or narrow property ( assuming some representational view of consciousness ) ; again , if some x is a candidate material referent for � p ' which fits the constraints , so does x - plus - a - higher - order - judgement - that - p - is - present . 4 . vagueness . block takes this indecision to show that � inflationism ' generates insuperable epistemological problems . i say it is just an upshot of vagueness in our phenomenal concepts . this is not ad hoc , given my analysis of phenomenal concepts . they are crude tools , whose purpose is to categorise humans depending , say , on whether they have f&s , or neither - f - nor - s. no reason to expect a decision on f - without s. could it be vague whether a being feels like this ? ( here imagine seeing something red . ) well , i 'm not saying it 's indeterminate how it is for the doppelganger , only whether our phenomenal term applies to it . must n't the doppelganger either be exactly like this , or not , in respect of colour experience . but compare : must n't you be exactly like me , or not , in respect of baldness ? 5 . consciousness - as - such . we can do similar research into the determinable phenomenal concept conscious ( -as - such ) . and here too we will find a plurality of candidates for the material referent . in particular , reported consciousness in humans will coincide both with ( dispositional)-higher - order - judgeability , and with attention ( cf seeing as ) . so i say it is a vague matter whether moggy , whose states lack higher - order - judgeability , but involve attention , is conscious . this is weirder : it 's one thing to say its vague whether another being is seeing something red , say ; it 's another to say its vague whether it 's conscious at all . but perhaps part of the impression of weirdness here comes from the ever - present pull of dualist intuitions . if you think consciousness involves some non - material extra , then of course you will think there is a fact of the matter as to whether this extra is present or not . again , i 'm not saying it 's indeterminate how it is for moggy , or any other creature . just that our phenomenal concept conscious - as - such fails to draw a sharp line among all creatures .

burst from the videogames industry on october 2nd appears to centre around the frankly surprising view that , in the industry 's eyes , fairplay apparently thinks that videogames fall fully - formed out of the sky . the organisers of the fairplay campaign have more than 50 years ' experience in the videogames industry between them . we are already aware , it may surprise and astonish the industry to learn , that videogames cost money to develop . x nevertheless , the fairplay campaign rests on a couple of extremely easy - to - understand principles . the physical manufacture of videogames is a very , very low - cost procedure . the development costs of games have already been incurred before the manufacturing process begins . therefore , any retail price which allows the sale of games to generate a gross , per - unit profit is potentially a viable route by which to recoup those development costs and then generate overall profit . the only question is whether a sufficient userbase exists to make a sufficient number of the gross per - unit profits to overtake the development cost . with games machines such as the playstation 2 having a userbase in excess of 40 million consoles , it is obviously clear that this is so . x the second principle is the industry 's circular , self - fulfilling argument that games have a comparatively small audience so prices must remain high . this is , amazingly obviously , bunk . quite aside from the fact that the most successful hit games actually have historically sold comparable amounts to successful albums , if music cds cost � 45 for one album , it 's a fairly safe assumption that they 'd have a dramatically smaller audience too . lowering the price of games would , beyond any reasonable doubt , increase the size of the potential audience significantly . this is hardly a contentious or outrageous claim . x the simple truth is that it 's fear of failure which motivates most of the objections to the fairplay campaign . until now , developers and publishers alike have been able to blame poor sales of their games , and huge financial losses of their companies , on an unbalanced , franchise - dominated market in which 95 % of games released lose money . failure is the comforting norm rather than the exception . with games pitched at widely - accessible impulse prices , though , that comfort blanket would be withdrawn . there would be no excuse for failure . good games ( and companies ) would make profits , bad ones would not . to fairplay 's mind , this is obviously a desirable state of affairs . but to an industry weaned on failure and desperate for government subsidies - rather than , for example , better management or better games - to bail out its 95 % of uneconomic and unsuccessful products , it represents the dawn of a new , unfamiliar and frightening future . x fairplay gently urges the games industry : do n't be afraid . step into the light ._. _ _ jobs at bupa we have around 40,000 members of staff in the uk and nearly 4,000 employees abroad . by investing as much in our people as in our services , we continue to stay ahead of the field , taking care of the lives in our hands . below , you can search our jobs database for current vacancies within bupa , or find more information about working for our different businesses ._. _ _ mrs. deirdre simpson the alumni relations office in london exists to help richmond alumni develop their links to the richmond network . we work with alumni to plan events and reunions , to establish local chapters around the world , to record alumni contact information , to receive donations to the annual fund , to support alumni representatives and mentors . we are always pleased to hear from you , by mail : alumni relations office richmond , the american international university in london asa briggs hall 7 -

' in terms of aggression against the rest of the world , the record of the liberal democracies - the british empire and its american successor - are still much worse than anything yet achieved by the dictatorships , whose exactions have tended to be directed chiefly against their own peoples . the principal role of the un is , surely , to ensure that every country in the world is able to work out its own process of historical evolution with as little interference as possible from other , more powerful countries . at present , thanks to the bundle of economic and ideological necessities that are driving the us and , apparently , uk , it can not fulfil that role . the un can only now have any political value ( as opposed to the continued , indispensable humanitarian value of , say , the un high commission for refugees ) if it becomes an engine of opposition to the united states and united kingdom . which is difficult given us domination of the security council and the physical presence of the un in new york . otherwise we might as well accept that the government of the us has become the government of the world , drop the old fashioned notion that every nation , every people , has a right to its own destiny , and follow richard perle 's advice to ' relax and enjoy it ' . which , as a contributor to the casi discussion list reminded us recently , was also the advice offered in the 1970s by tex antoine , weatherman on wabc 's " eyewitness news " , to victims of rape , once resistance has become impossible . mr antoine 's thinking was a bit ahead of his time and he lost his job as a result . news , 16 - 23/04/03 ( 1 ) new iraqi order * for the people on the streets , this is not liberation but a new colonial oppression [ robert fisk , after complaining that the invaders are not being sufficiently zealous in tracking down members of the government of iraq , expresses astonishment at the failure to safeguard iraqi government archives . he points out that the looters and arsonists are not the same people and that the arsonists are organised and apparently being paid for their work , apparently with the connivance of the occupying force ] * bush cultural advisers quit over iraq museum theft [ chairman and one member of the president 's advisory committee on cultural property ] * iraqi general lays claim to baghdad mayoralty [ general jawdat al - obeidi of the fif , together with mohamed mohsen zubaidi ] * confusion over baghdad ' vote ' [ captain joe plenzler , a us marine spokesman in baghdad , tells afp news agency , that ' future appointments like this [ the mayor of baghdad - pb ] will be handled through usaid ' ] * iraqis welcome plan to mark saddam campaign [ exiled iraqis welcoming mr blair 's idea for a victory celebration . no proposal that it should be taking place in baghdad ... ] * us to pay iraqi workers in dollars [ ' funds for the payments will come from the $ 1.7 billion in iraqi assets that the us has recently frozen . ' the article refers to ' the more stable " swiss dinar " , a pre - saddam dinar used in the kurdish north . it earned its nickname because of switzerland 's reputation for financial probity . ' my understanding was that they had their name because they were printed in switzerland . ] * u.s. victory has steep price in maintaining safe iraq peace . international law places demands on occupier [ ' the laws of occupation are so demanding that some legal scholars think they are a disincentive for american officials to declare a formal end to the war . ' but note also that : ' the occupying forces can restrict the movement of citizens , regulate commercial business , seize and operate public transportation and censor newspapers and broadcast stations , according to the united states ' interpretations of international law . it can collect taxes , create a new currency system and operate government revenue sources - like the iraqi oil wells - to pay for the costs of occupation . ' presumably iraq had the legal right to do all that in kuwait . ] * direct democracy in action [ pepe escobar ( of all people ) finds what must be the us ideal scenario - peace , joy at the removal of saddam , sympathetic reception for the inc - unfolding before his eyes in hilla , site of a major wartime clusterbomb massacre ] * communist newspaper back in baghdad [ " with the dictatorship 's collapse , all the wishes of the vast majority of the iraqi people have come true " . so why did the iraqi cp oppose the invasion ? note how it is the cp , and not the inc with all the money they got from congress and time they 've had to prepare , that is first in with a daily newspaper to fill the information void ] * confusion over who controls iraq oil ministry [ is it the new , inc associated , ' mayor of baghdad ' ? or is it a former ' director general ' apparently recognised as such by the employees ? who makes the following witty and perceptive remark : ' " we have a lot of experience with coup d' � tats and this one is the worst , " he said . " any colonel in the iraqi army will tell you that when he does a coup d' � tat , he goes to the broadcasting station with five announcements . the first one is long live this , down with that . the second one is your new government is this and that . the third is the list of the people to go on retirement . the fourth one , every other official is to report back to work tomorrow morning . the fifth is the curfew . " this is usually done within one hour , he added . " now we are waiting more than a week and still we hear nothing from them .

' most of it , i thought , was fairly well established but note : ' david wise , a washington - based author who has written extensively about cold war espionage , says he is only aware of records showing that a cia group known as the " health alteration committee " tried to assassinate kassem in 1960 by sending the iraqi leader a poisoned monogrammed handkerchief .

" ' ] * blair is in thrall to the myth of a monolithic modernity [ john gray in the guardian discusses the intellectual roots beneath mr blair 's conviction that ' there is only one way of being modern and it is american ' . saint - simon , augiuste comte , karl marx etc . while the argument is broadly right there are complications . for example the one neo - conservative he mentions by name is paul wolfowitz . wolfowitz - and he is far from being alone - is a disciple of leo strauss . strauss saw himself as an anti-'modernist ' and insisted that , although some form of religious fundamentalism was necessary to keep the masses happy , it would n't do for superior people such as himself and mr wolfowitz . given that mr blair does indeed seem to believe sincerely in modernisation and progress , this presumably puts him - in the eyes of wolfowitz , kristol , ledeen etc - into the category of ' useful idiot ' ] * open the books on oil - for - food [ claudia rosett , in the international herald tribune , thinks the details of the oil for food scam could reveal a lot of hanky panky on the part of iraq 's favoured trading partners ( france , russia , syria ) ] * william safire : will chiracism hold back iraq ? [ william safire waxes indignant at all the illegal things that might have been going on under cover of the wretched formula for illegal economic activity usuk has imposed on iraq , via the un , for the past twelve years , with mr safire 's enthusiastic support ] * france meets u.s. halfway on iraq sanctions lift [ the french draw a distinction between ' sanctions ' , which they want to remove , and ' oil for food ' , which they think they should stay , though in the past six or seven years the terms ' sanctions ' and ' oil for food ' have become virutally synonymous . although the notion of keeping oil for food until such time as iraq is declared free of weapons of mass destruction seems a bit absurd ( given that the whole notion of iraq 's wmds was just a fable got up for the purpose of imposing sanctions ) it is , surely , impossible to end un control of the iraqi oil industry in the absence of an internationally recognised iraqi government competent to administer it ] nervous neighbours * powell plans talks with syrian president * american pressure on syria dominates regional press [ lebanon daily star roundup ] * firm to sue annan over lost trade [ bahraini firm whose contracts with un representatives fell through when the un personnel withdrew at the start of the war ] * turkey 's iraq odyssey ends in tragedy [ mohammad noureddine of the lebanon daily star on the apparently complete failure of turkish diplomacy . but is it possible that recip erdogan 's party maybe does n't share the turkish military 's obsession with preventing the emergence of an autonomous kurdish entity in northern iraq ? ] * us has no legitimate right to iraqi oil and lifting of sanctions must wait , say neighbours [ joint statement from meeting in ryadh ] * israeli writer calls for iraqi - palestinian - jordanian merger under hashimites [ yosef goell argues in the jerusalem post that palestinians need to be freed from israeli domination but israel can not allow the creation of a viscerally anti - israeli palestinian state on its borders . the solution is to restore the west bank to jordan and compensate the hashemites for all the trouble this would bring them by giving them iraq ( shorn of the kurdish part of it ) . seems like a good idea to me , though i would prefer to see a unitary greater israel / palestine with equal rights - including a right of return for refugees - for all . this has the advantage over mr goell 's suggestion that it would enable a continued jewish presence in the holy sites on the ' west bank ' ] and , in news , 16 - 23/04/03 ( 4 ) turbulent mullahs * in shiite holy city kerbala , iraqis form committee to fill vacuum [ with judge , mohammed ali nasrallah , and ' ayatollah mohammed al - tabtabai , imprisoned for 20 years in the notorious abu gharib jail ' al - tabtabai was released in october , a further sign that the october amnesty wasn � t just confined to criminals ] * shiite clerics face a time of opportunity and risks [ long account from washington post : sayyid muqtada sadr and grand ayatollah ali sistani in najaf , abdel - mahdi salami in karbala , sayed abbas in kut ] mujahideen al - khalq * u.s. takes on mujahedeen militia in iraq [ mujahedeen khalq ...

" the likelihood of it seems to me to be so low that it does not surprise me that it 's never been discussed in my presence to my knowledge . " ' which leaves us wondering why mr rumsfeld should apparently regard such an obvious idea as strange or discreditable , and what sort of thing does get discussed in his presence ? ] progress of the pretext * iraq destroyed chemical weapons just before war , scientist reportedly says [ anonymous scientist tells the americans exactly what they want to hear . his account ' supports the bush administration 's charges that iraq continued to develop those weapons and lied to the united nations about it . ' it ' also provided an explanation for why u.s. forces had not yet turned up caches of banned weapons in iraq ' . and even provides a link with al qaida . funny that by the time of writing ( may 3rd ) it seems to have disappeared off the radar screen ] memories of the war * why iraqi army walked away from baghdad [ very interesting account which seems to support the thesis of a betrayal by the leadership of the republican guard : maj . salah abdullah mahdi al jabouri , a 17-year army veteran ' said the disappearance was n't the result of desertion or a disorganized rout but was ordered by the highest levels and communicated to field units by telephone ...
