address any such requests to : the data protection officer cabe 1 kemble street london wc2b 4an_nn _ _ i would just like to thank kevin for providing the information for this article . as you can see by the pictures , this breeder deserves all the congratulations and more for his competition wins of 2003 . the beginning of a supreme stud . having kept birds for 22years of different species , in 1992/3 after exchanging 4 glosters for a pair of heck 's grass finches breed by myself , these birds turned out to be hens so i purchased some cocks and two additional pairs from a successful local breeder . following the breeding season the breeder visited my bird room and showed a great deal of interest in one particular youngster , a blue corona hen , which promptly entered into the local cage bird society show . i stewarded at the show in the hope that i could learn something from an experienced judge , richard lambert . i was delighted to take the best novice award with the blue corona hen , having had 3 of the final 4 birds that were being considered for this award . i was even more delighted when the bird took top honours , to beat the best champion bird , for best gloster , even more to my surprise eventually gaining � best canary � in show . following a discussion with richard lambert , who gave me a great deal of encouragement , i was really starting to catch the gloster bug ! developing a stud of exhibition glosters . i now needed to develop a stud that would produce birds to compete nationally . successful breeding off many varieties , including half masked weavers , red cheeked cordon bleus and gold breasted waxbills , were to provide a base of experience that i thought would deal with any problem that could arise . wrong ! ! for a bird that breeds so readily , the canary certainly produces more than it 's fair share of problems . i set about producing a 5 year plan , aiming to progressively improve various aspects within my stud and setting reasonable target for exhibition results . the targets for the next couple of years were to produce birds well rounded but not too long and to get a few birds in the cards perhaps with the occasional class win at all gloster shows . only the most typey birds were kept for the first few years breeding , quickly followed by introduction of yellow feather years 2 and 4 , success at novice level came fast , specials being taken at most shows . the move to champion status appeared daunting , so during my 4th novice year the champion section was studied very closely , identifying 2 breeders who were particularly strong in areas i needed to develop further . the first breeders birds were eventually integrated into my own line in year 2 , i.e. after i had seen the young that they produced as they appeared to be quite similar in type and feather , who 's birds would provide the quality of corona ( length of feather and drop ) , whilst they were paired to my existing stock and maintaining the type that i already had . i also acquired birds from spring and saunders partnership , realising that these particular examples were not show birds and would need to be used to produce the desired characteristics that would eventually be introduce in a controlled manner into my own line , to try to reproduce the quality that they are renowned for . from these birds i was looking for quality of feather and crest . occasional birds ( including a yellow ) , were introduced to my existing stock . in the following 2 years , i purchased further birds from them . i have maintained a pure saunders and spring line ever since and currently 50 % of my birds are that line . this would take at least 3 years , i.e. to 2nd year champion . the seconded breeder 's birds were mainly kept separate , carefully introducing occasional yellows and buffs to refine my first line 's feather quality . the second line continued to be developed alongside the first , perseverance being required to produce the required results . the quality was obviously in there , but producing good show birds took a few years , until they eventually stared to appear with the desired type and silky feather quality . the forth year as a champion produced birds from both lines which were repeatedly being considered for best in show awards . this was repeated in 2002 my 10th year in breeding and exhibiting glosters , resulting in many specials awards , including best in show at the yorkshire , midland and east anglian all gloster show , a special at the igba show , and an excellent result for myself and the gloster fancy at the national . it 's good to see the gloster back on top were it belongs ! future plans 2003 was going to be difficult , with the possibilities of house move and building other birdroom to contend with . as far as the birds are concerned , i shall be aiming to produce some cinnamons over the next 2 years and was looking forward to producing birds from the national champion . i had many ideas about which hens to pair to him and his brother , so i am certainly looking forward to 2003 . they are both cinnamon carriers , so the intention was to only pair them to buff feathered birds , i.e. not yellows or cinnamons , but a blue was included in my plans . as it turned out , the bird which was considered to have the best head characteristics for the supreme champion was a nicely rounded yellow , not particularly high in colour , but a quality bird nevertheless . i have another cinnamon project which has now being ongoing for 3 years and will take another 2 years to complete , this involves progressively combing type , the cinnamon gene , colour intensification and feather refinement . problems encountered along the way internal parasites were the cause of a number of fatalities in fledglings during the firsts novices years . that has now being combated by scrubbing the cages out with disinfectant and treating the birds for worms , coccidiosis ( half strength ) and trichomoniasis or ( canker ) prior to pairing up . initially , i was n't aware that all birds carry these parasites and they need restricting to low levels to reduce the number of birds which ' go light ' . young birds are given further preventive treatment for worms and coccidiosis ( half strength ) at about 6 weeks old . helpful friends and clubs many people have been very helpful to me and become good friends . i 've had help with the provisions of extra breeding cages the late bill dickinson & richard lumley , and with transportation to some shows ( dave paine , dave rands , alan backhouse ) . i 'm grateful to these and so many other friends that have been made at the gloster clubs and their shows . i would recommended the following clubs for meeting helpful fanciers and holding excellent shows the:- east anglian gloster fancy canary club ( social evening , very competitive show ) humberside gloster association ( competitive show , good novice entry ) international gloster breeders association ( biggest , best and most challenging event ) midland gloster fancy club ( competitive show ) yorkshire gloster canary club ( competitive show , now in a much bigger hall ) glosters 2003 there is now the opportunity to promote the gloster canary whilst it is in the minds of avicultural world . we know what a great variety it is , but we need to educate and encourage others . finally , i would like to wish you all a successful show season . yours in the fancy , kevin stoakes . i will consider any gloster breeders willing to participate in providing an article for this page , please contact me and i will add your name to the list ,_, _ _ 3 crescent wood road , sydenham the home of colour television , high definition television and john logie baird 1933 - 1946 no 3 crescent wood road today hidden behind bushes & trees dulwich wood house no 3 is to the left just beyond the tree today 's crystal palace tv transmitter only � mile away along sydenham hill john logie baird invented television in 1926 . he also patented a system which later became known as radar . he helped the bbc begin the first public television service in 1932 . he moved to crescent wood road on sydenham hill and established the world 's first major tv studio and broadscasting complex at the crystal palace - less than a mile away . his initial tv system was electro - mechanical and during the thirties baird television came under intense competition from a complete electronic system pioneered by marconi - emi . there was a dramatic ' play - off ' conducted by the bbc & uk government in 1936 for the first high definition ( for the time ) tv system . marconi - emi won and baird television was finished as a successful commercial enterprise . but john logie baird did not give up . instead he embraced electronic tv and with the aid of just two assistants continued work in his crescent wood road laboratory . here baird developed of the worlds first colour television system - first at 600 lines which he successfully demonstrated in december 1940 at crescent wood road . he later went on to test a very high definition version of 1800 lines - three times the definition of current colour tv and even higher than currently proposed high definition tv systems . he also did pioneering work in 3d stereoscopic tv . baird testified to the hankey committee in 1943 on how post war television should develop . he argued for 1000 + line systems . this was not to be . the uk system upto 1964 was based solely on emi 's 405 line system and even now is still only 625 lines . it may be a few more years before we see 1000 line colour television again in sydenham homes . the onset of war in 1939 meant that much of his work was believed to have been diverted in to the development of radar and other electronic systems to aid the war effort . this secret work is still classified so we will have to wait a little longer to hear the full story of john logie baird 's great work in sydenham . baird has , however , left a legacy that we all still enjoy in our homes today . the sony trintron tube follows from his work on using a single gun colour cathode ray tube . a significant amount of pre - recorded tv uses the film scanning system of rank - cintel ( who had takern over baird 's cinema television ) and the everyday video casstte recorder was the ultimate exploitation of electro - mechanical scanning in the reproduction of tv . baird 's work has rarely been fully recognised . the us actually declared their philo farnsworth to have invented tv in 1927 a later and an inferior system ! perhaps sydenham should reconsider how it should recognise a pioneer who invented the most significant way people today access information and entertainment . meanwhile

mosquito . the species of mosquito that is responsible for spreading yellow fever is aedes aegypti and is a different species from the anopheles mosquito that transmits malaria . essentially yellow fever is a disease of monkeys living in tropical rain forests . the virus which causes the disease is one of a group of viruses known as arboviruses . humans are infected by being bitten by rain forest mosquitos carrying the yellow fever virus . as their name implies " arboviruses " are transmitted to humans by insects ( arthropod borne virus ) . the mosquito in particular is well suited to the transport and spread of the infection due to its wide distribution throughout the tropics . the geographical distribution of yellow fever is confined to equatorial africa and central south america as shown on the maps as shown . strangely , yellow fever is unknown in asia despite the presence of mosquitos capable of spreading the virus . arbovirus illnesses usually have two characteristic phases , the first when the virus is invading the host cells , and the second a few days later when the body 's immune system is fighting the infection . the antibodies produced during the second phase of illness can cause damage to the blood vessels which explains why arboviruses often cause bleeding . many yellow fever infections are mild and go unrecognised but severe and life threatening illness is not uncommon . after an incubation period of about three to six days fever , headache , abdominal pain and vomiting develop . after a brief recovery period , shock , bleeding and signs of liver and kidney failure develop . liver failure is associated with jaundice hence the name " yellow fever " . there is no drug available to cure yellow fever hence treatment is aimed at symptomatic relief . overall about 5 % of patients die . those who recover do so completely and are immune thereafter . fortunately yellow fever is one of the few arboviruses for which a vaccination is available . a single injection of a live , weakened ( and harmless ) virus stimulates the body 's immune defences and confers effective immunity for ten years . for a list of clinics in the uk where you can obtain yellow fever & other vaccines:- in general , all travellers going to an endemic area require a yellow fever vaccination certificate and travellers going to some parts of asia from an endemic region will also require a certificate . dengue fever this is an unusual arbovirus infection since no other animals except humans and mosquitoes play a significant part in perpetuating the infection . it is present in africa , south east asia , the pacific area and northern south america . the disease is spread from person to person by the bite of a mosquito ( aedes aegypti ) and after about five days incubation period there is a sudden onset of fever , headache and severe joint and muscle pains . the initial fever resolves after about three to five days only to recur with the appearance of a rash consisting of small white spots which starts on the trunk and spreads to the limbs and face . within a few days the fever subsides and recovery follows . although dengue is a very unpleasant illness , complications are uncommon and recovery is usually complete . there is also a more severe and life threatening haemorrhagic form of the disease which has appeared with dramatic outbreaks . fortunately this form occurs only rarely . this is thought to be the result of a second infection where there is some remaining immunity from a first attack causing a vigorous immunological response in which severe blood vessel damage occurs . unfortunately , immunity to infection does not last long and subsequent attacks are possible . there is no vaccine available . prevention is by avoiding mosquito bites . japanese b encephalitis this is a rare but serious arboviral infection with a 20 % fatality rate . it occurs in most of the far east and south east asia . the endemic zone extends from india and nepal across the whole of south east asia to japan and korea in the far east . the risk of infection is greatest in long term visitors to rural areas , and the risk to short term visitors and visitors to major cities is small . precautions against mosquito bites are essential . japanese b encephalitis is transmitted by rice field breeding mosquitoes ( of the culex group ) that become infected with japanese encephalitis virus . mosquitoes become infected by feeding on domestic pigs and wild birds infected with the japanese encephalitis virus . infected mosquitoes then transmit the japanese encephalitis virus to humans and animals during the feeding process . the incubation period is normally between 5 and 15 days . the illness can not be passed on from person to person . there is no specific treatment . intensive supportive therapy is indicated . mild infections can sometimes occur without apparent symptoms other than mild fever with headache . more severe infection is marked by quick onset , headache , high fever , neck stiffness , stupor , disorientation , coma , tremors , occasional convulsions ( especially in infants ) and spastic paralysis . there is an effective vaccine available in the uk on a named patient basis . it should be considered by anyone travelling to asia for more than a month or visiting rural areas . tick borne encephalitis ticks are blood feeding external parasites of mammals , birds , and reptiles throughout the world . ticks are not insects like fleas , but arachnids like mites , spiders and scorpions . tick - borne encephalitis ( tbe ) , is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system . the disease is most often manifest as meningitis or encephalitis or sometimes , even meningoencephalitis . it is caused by the tick - borne encephalitis virus ( tbev ) , a member of the family flaviviridae . tbe is endemic in many european countries , the former soviet union , and asia . it is found mainly in temperate regions . the natural hosts of the virus are small rodents and deer , with humans being accidental hosts . after attaching itself to the host , an infected tick transfers the virus to the host during feeding . map showing tbe endemic areas in disease endemic areas , people with recreational or occupational exposure to rural or outdoor settings such as ; hunters , hikers , campers , forest workers , farmers , etc . are potentially at risk of infection by contact with the infected ticks . the incubation period of tbe is usually between 7 and 14 days . a characteristic biphasic febrile illness follows , with an initial phase that lasts two to four days . it is non - specific with symptoms that may include fever , malaise , anorexia , muscle aches , headache , nausea , and/or vomiting . after about eight days of remission , the second phase of the disease occurs in twenty to thirty percent of patients and involves the central nervous system with symptoms of meningitis ( fever , headache , and a stiff neck ) or encephalitis ( drowsiness , confusion , sensory disturbances , and/or motor abnormalities such as paralysis ) or meningoencephalitis . tbe is more severe in adults than in children . mortality is about two percent with deaths occurring five to seven days after the onset of neurological signs . there is no specific treatment for tbe . meningitis , encephalitis , or meningoencephalitis require hospitalisation and supportive care . like other tick - borne infectious diseases , tbev infection can be prevented by using insect repellents and protective clothing to prevent tick bites . a vaccine is available in some disease endemic areas but adverse vaccine reactions in children limit the use of the vaccine . the vaccine involves two doses one month apart . if required a booster is given after a year . symptoms of west nile virus symptoms of a mild infection : fever , headache , bodyaches , skin rash , and swollen lymph glands symptoms of a severe infection may be marked by : high fever , severe headache , neck stiffness , stupor , disorientation , tremors , convulsions , muscle weakness , paralysis , and coma contact your health care provider if you have concerns about your health . if severe symptoms develop , see your doctor immediately . west nile virus west nile virus is a flavivirus commonly found in africa , west asia , the middle east and the united states . the virus can infect humans , birds , mosquitoes , horses and some other mammals . the principal route of human infection with west nile virus is through the bite of an infected mosquito . mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds , which circulate the virus in their blood for a few days . the virus replicates in the mosquito and spreads to the mosquito 's salivary glands . during subsequent blood meals , the virus may be injected into humans and animals , where it can multiply and possibly cause illness . at least 36 species of mosquito are known to be carriers of west nile virus . the most common carrier of west nile in the united states is the culex pipiens ( northern house ) mosquito . west nile fever is usually a case of mild disease characterized by flu - like symptoms . it typically lasts only a few days and does not appear to cause any long - term health effects . more severe disease due to a person being infected with this virus can be west nile encephalitis , west nile meningitis or west nile meningoencephalitis . encephalitis refers to an inflammation of the brain , meningitis is an inflammation of the membrane around the brain and the spinal cord , and meningoencephalitis refers to inflammation of the brain and the membrane surrounding it . the incubation period is usually 3 to 14 days . symptoms of mild disease will generally last a few days . symptoms of severe disease may last several weeks , although neurological effects may be permanent . many people who are infected with the west nile virus will not have any type of illness . it is estimated that 20 % of the people who become infected will develop west nile fever : mild symptoms , including fever , headache , and body aches , occasionally with a skin rash on the trunk of the body and swollen lymph glands . the symptoms of severe infection ( west nile encephalitis or meningitis ) include headache , high fever , neck stiffness , stupor , disorientation , coma , tremors , convulsions , muscle weakness , and paralysis . it is estimated that 1 in 150 persons infected with the west nile virus will develop a more severe form of disease . there is no specific treatment for west nile virus infection . in more severe cases , intensive supportive therapy is indicated , often involving hospitalization , intravenous fluids , airway management , respiratory support ( ventilator ) , prevention of secondary infections ( pneumonia , urinary tract , etc . ) , and good nursing care . when travelling to areas where the disease is endemic you can reduce the risk of becoming infected with the virus by employing preventive measures such as protecting yourself from mosquito bites:- apply insect rellent to your skin and clothes when going outside when possible , wear long - sleeved shirts and long pants whenever you are outdoors . place mosquito netting over infant carriers when you are outdoors with infants . consider staying indoors at dawn , dusk , and in the early evening , which are peak mosquito biting times . make sure any window and door screens are intact so that mosquitoes can not get indoors . use mosquito nets around beds at night while asleep . many of the mosquitoes that carry the west nile virus are especially likely to bite around dusk and dawn . if you are outdoors around these times of the day , it is important to apply repellent . but there are also mosquitoes that bite during the day , and these mosquitoes have also been found to carry the west nile virus . the safest decision is to apply repellent whenever you are outdoors apply insect repellent sparingly to exposed skin . the more deet a repellent contains the longer time it can protect you from mosquito bites . a higher percentage of deet in a repellent does not mean that your protection is better � just that it will last longer . deet concentrations higher than 50 % do not increase the length of protection . choose a repellent that provides protection for the amount of time that you will be outdoors ._. _ _ feline flotsam copyright � 2003 - 06 purr ' n ' fur uk free desktop wallpaper created from our large

only question seems an arbitrary subset of a bigger issue . what people object to ( as i interpret it ) is the deposition of a minimum of data to give other scientists the lowest quantity of information possible , thus preserving some perceived advantage for the depositer . this is not limited to some impertinent ca - only depositions , but also to those who never deposit fobs , or those who fail to include the interesting parts of the structure ( uncommon modifications / substrates ) in the coordinate file , despite the fact they are shown in figures in a publication . i would assert that ca - only models are not necessarily bad , because there are results for which they are the most practical respresentation of the data available . what we have to ensure is that the data being deposited in the pdb represent the data described in the publication in full . this disclosure is the ' cost ' of publication , and all who publish should share this cost proportionally . the difficult question is how the disclosure of data is enforced . is it the pdb 's job ? , the journals ' job ? , iucr ? , referees ? , funding bodies ? blanket banning of particular types of information from the pdb sounds too much like a step backwards rather than forwards . cheers , charlie -- dr charles s. bond university of dundee tel : + 44 -

computing thousands of hypocentres and magnitudes . the new program was written to more readily use alternative travel time models , attenuation curves , and other parameters . a modular design allows users to introduce their own algorithms . iscloc uses geiger 's method to improve an initial hypocentre , and limits the effect of outliers with jeffreys ' uniform reduction algorithm . the program can automatically re - start iterations from different starting points until the solution converges . iscloc reads input data and writes results in isf , the format recommended by iaspei since 2001 for exchanging seismic bulletin data . iscloc uses the isf i / o library released in 2002 , which the isc intends to keep up to date with isf amendments . use of isf means that the new version of wizmapii developed by the british geological survey in 2002 can be used as a graphical user interface to display maps of iscloc results . iscloc has been tested at the isc principally with jeffreys - bullen travel times , but the travel time models that are part of this release include iasp91 and ak135 . the release includes p and s source and station corrections computed by the isc from the mooney - laske 2 � resolution global crustal model . iscloc has also been tested with source - specific station corrections computed from laterally variable mantle models . in a poster at iugg , iscloc developer richard luckett will describe results from his tests with several sets of travel time corrections . somewhat surprisingly , he finds that corrections computed from crustal models improve neither seismically - determined hypocentres nor arrival time residuals for many events with ground - truth locations . iscloc is written in c , and the source code is available from the isc web site at http://www.isc.ac.uk/documents/location . full documentation can be consulted on - line at the same page . search for a new director the executive committee of the isc governing council is searching for a new director . the current director , ray willemann , has told council chairman adam dziewonski that he plans to leave the isc by the end of 2003 . the committee encourages applications from candidates who have experience of data centre operations , preparing funding proposals , and managing a staff and budget . knowledge of seismology and computing are both important . details of the application procedure are available from the isc web site or can be requested from the isc by phone , fax , post or e - mail . the committee plans to accept applications until 1 june . new ftp service isc data files are now available from an anonymous ftp server with a broadband connection to the internet . the server is physically remote from the centre and can be accessed as seismo.gvon.co.uk . a link to the ftp server from the home page on isc 's web site can be used to download files from the ftp server with a web browser . the service 's main purpose is distributing complete results promptly when the isc 's final analysis for a month is done . although this on - line distribution is much quicker than infrequently produced cds , the isc plans to continue distributing both the catalogue cd and the bulletin cd each year . the files for january to june 2001 are available already , and the isc plans to post further files about once every four weeks . the isc offers a notification service , which sends subscribers an e - mail each time files for another month are posted . to subscribe to the notices , you may either complete the on - line form at http://www.isc.ac.uk/notices.htm or send an e - mail to notices@isc.ac.uk with " subscribe " and your e - mail address in the first line of the message body . directories on the ftp site parallel those on isc cds . catalogue files ( which have only hypocentral parameters ) and bulletin files ( with both hypocentres and associated phase readings ) are available , and each is posted both in 96-column format and iaspei seismic format ( isf ) . the files are compressed , which can greatly speed downloads even with the server 's fast internet connection . even so , users who do not require phase data will still find that retrieving the catalogue files is quicker . the typeset monthly bulletins and the semi - annual regional catalogues are also available as pdf documents . users who browse the listings may find these typeset documents easier to use , and they include the separate lists of explosions and major events that have long been included in the catalogue . more waveform links the isc web site has been improved to help users of the on - line bulletin retrieve waveforms from more data centres . some waveform data centres assemble sets of waveform segments for events of special interest , and for several years the on - line bulletin has included hypertext links to such data sets . in addition , the isc now provides a straightforward 3-step system to send e - mail requesting segments from continuous archives . first the user selects an event and the system provides a summary of data available at the time of the event . second , the user specifies parameters that control the channels and time intervals to be requested , and an e - mail address to which the waveforms should be sent . the system then lists the channels that satisfy the criteria . third , the user removes unwanted channels and submits the list . the system then composes and despatches request messages to all of the data centres from which the user requires data , and posts a confirmation page to the user . the system offers each user the choice of recording their channel and time interval criteria as a " cookie " in their web browser . a user who accepts the cookie can then compose requests for data for other events without re - entering the same criteria . to be really useful , the service requires waveform inventories that are complete and accurate . the iris dmc and cmr provide services that enable the isc to meet this challenge by retrieving channel lists in real time . for other centres , the isc uses channel lists with station open and close dates and rules specific to some of the data centres regarding data availability . the system supports both autodrm and breqfast request protocols , and users receive e - mails with data in the default format for each data centre . the system already helps users retrieve data from several data centres in each of north america and europe , and other data centres offering automated responses to e - mail requests for waveform data can be added quickly . to try the system , users can select events from the on - line bulletin and click on the waveform icon , which appears below each event line . isc abstracts posted members of the isc staff plan to present several posters this year at the iugg assembly . among other things , the posters will inform users about the isc 's new services , summarise recent results , and compare results with other bulletins . nurcan � zel and dmitry storchak will present a poster that compares coverage of turkey in bulletins from the isc and kandilli observatory . they conclude that outside of kandilli 's network , the isc computes reliable hypocentres for more earthquakes using data from other agencies . within the network , however , kandilli 's bulletin takes advantage of later phases as well as local travel times and attenuation models . another poster is on isc 's joint project with the university of leeds to automatically measure sks splitting . matt evans , a leeds student , is first among authors from leeds , the czech academy of sciences , and the isc . matt plans for the poster to describe how he chose algorithms , partly by comparing results from several independently developed programs , as well as an initial set of measurements and their significance . interim survey results for the past 4 months , the isc has been asking web users of its on - line bulletin to complete a simple survey . so far , 206 users in 47 countries have responded . respondents are asked to chose the one thing that is most important for isc to do among " collect more data " , " compute better hypocentres " , or " improve data distribution " . of the 128 who answered this question , a small plurality favours a focus on collecting more data . computing better hypocentres is the second favourite area for development . only about 1 in 9 of all survey participants want the isc to invest its efforts principally in improving distribution . among the 170 respondents who indicated what country they work in , the us ( 32 ) and iran ( 13 ) are most well represented , followed by greece , russia , france , canada , romania and japan . among american respondents , more than half of those expressing a view think that the isc should focus on data collection . iranian , european union and other respondents each agree with the americans that data collection is most important . what 's more , all of the geographically defined groups also agree that computing hypocentres is the next most important area for improvement . respondents were also asked to indicate in which fields of seismology they worked . among those working in " earth structure " , " explosion monitoring " , " earthquake physics " , " earthquake engineering " and " seismic hazard " the plurality view collecting more data as most important . only among those in " tectonics " and " seismological methods " is computing better hypocentres the most popular area for improving the isc . perhaps the tectonicians emphasise hypocentral accuracy because they have the greatest need for it , regardless of how accuracy is achieved . on the other hand , many methodologists probably have strongly held views on just how isc hypocentres should be improved . the survey also asks about publications in refereed journals that make use of isc data , which helps to demonstrate wide use of isc services . users who have not yet participated in the survey are encouraged to complete the form at http://www.isc.ac.uk/users/profile.htm and the follow -

quality and effectiveness of review discussions . group discussion is the perhaps the most fundamental reviewing technique of all . it can also be the most difficult and the most unpredictable . when free - flowing and lively discussions about shared experiences happen they often have a life of their own and need little or no extra facilitation . if you sometimes find yourself in un rewarding discussions that do not fit this description , then some of the interventions or gimmicks described here ( and used sparingly ! ) can help to create a climate in which lively and worthwhile discussions are more likely to happen . most of the reviewing methods described throughout this ' guide to active reviewing ' can be used to stimulate , focus or complement group discussion . top on this page group discussion reviewing reviews revising ground rules mixing the group varying methods preparation by learners reviewing review discussions discussion is likely to be the most frequently used reviewing method , so it is well worth spending time reviewing it ! ask the group to make three separate lists of what they have found plus , minus and interesting about the review discussions so far . ask : " what have been the most enjoyable and most worthwhile discussions so far ? " " what have you ' given to ' and ' got from ' discussions so far ? " " how can the discussions we have be improved ? " " which of these ideas shall we try out for our next review discussion ? " also ask each person to come up with two action points which will help them to both give and get more in future discussions . if individuals are stuck for ideas , ask the group to make suggestions . if the idea is being promoted that reviewer and participants share responsibility for the quality of discussions , then it is logical for the reviewer to end up with two action points for herself . top revising ground rules a few basic ' ground rules ' , negotiated with the group , and expressed in positive statements , can help to generate a climate for good review discussions . the rules are created by reviewing the initial experiences of the group . for example , ask learners to use these sentence beginnings in paired interviews , and then discuss responses as a whole group : what 's good about the atmosphere in this group is ... it is difficult to speak up in this group when ... this group is good / not good at ... i would be happier in this group if ... i would take part more in reviews / activities if ... i would learn / benefit more if ... there are many advantages of developing rules based on the group 's experience of their discussions so far . for example , rules generated in this way are guaranteed to be ... relevant to understood by supported by owned by ( and even ) enforced by ... ... the group who created them . also , unnecessary rules are unlikely to be created by this process . avoid creating too many rules - especially if the resulting list is likely to stifle , distort or divert discussion . if you end up with a list that seems too long , then ask the group to select the top 3 ' rules ' , and demote the rest to ' proposals ' , ' expectations ' or ' intentions ' . top mixing the group experiment with reviewing in different sized groups . this helps to change patterns of relationships within a group . some people prefer the relative intimacy of reviewing in pairs or sub - groups ; others prefer larger groups - so it pays to change group sizes frequently . it is also important to keep changing pairings or sub - groups , so that everyone gets to work with everyone else , and so that cliques do not develop . unlikely pairs : if people are being asked to work with partners they do n't get on with very well , it is particularly important to provide them with a reviewing task which they are likely to achieve and enjoy . ask everyone to report back to the whole group on how they got on with each other . if the answer is at least as good as " better than expected " , then this strategy is working ! top varying reviewing methods variety adds to interest and motivation ( for all learners ) , and will continually open up new perspectives . although a reviewer may have a favourite style or method of reviewing , this will not be the best way for each and every person in a group to learn . by varying your reviewing methods and by varying your approach to review discussions you are opening up a wider variety of opportunities for communicating and learning . introduce variety into how discussions are set up and managed . this job should not automatically fall to the facilitator : in many courses ( youth and adult ) , it is highly relevant for participants themselves to practise their facilitation skills and to lead discussions . see ' preparation by learners ' ( next ) top preparation by learners before the activity , ask the group to list potential review topics , and ask each individual ( or pair ) to take responsibility for leading a topic during the review . when all have decided on a topic give them time to prepare . the reviewer is available for advice during preparation , but is involved as little as possible during the review itself . people will often respond well when their friends or peers are leading the review . this is even more the case when everyone knows that they themselves will have a turn at leading a review topic . leading a review topic can be a greater responsibility or challenge than the activity being reviewed - so ensure that everyone receives feedback on how they conducted their part of the review . the feedback may come from the group or the reviewer or both ._. _ _ physical access all our performance spaces , studios 1 , 2 and 3 , the cafe / bar and terrace are all situated on the ground floor and are easily accessible . unfortunately , the first and second floors , which include the cinema and studio 4 , are inaccessible to wheelchair users or those with mobility impairments because there is no lift . we are currently in the process of fundraising in order to have a lift installed and hope to complete this by the end of next year . car parking unfortunately , there is no dedicated disabled parking at riverside , although spaces near to the building are often available . ticket concessions concessionary tickets for wheelchair users and an accompanying person are usually available . please indicate clearly at the time of booking if the ticket is for a wheelchair user and if a ticket is required for an accompanying person . please advise the box office of any other special requirements at the time of booking . induction loop please note an induction loop is available in the cinema only . a portable induction loop , for use in and around the centre , is available from reception although this is not suitable for use during productions . website text only a text only version of the full riverside studios website is also available by using the link on the left hand side of all pages or by visiting : www.riversidestudios.co.uk/text more information please feel free to contact the front of house department if you require any further help or information on 020 8237 1007 or send us an_dt _ _ development and recognition one of our aims is to lead , support and inform the professional development and recognition of staff in higher education . the academy register we maintain a register of accredited practitioners , define the criteria for admission , develop standards for professional practice and provide support for individuals . accreditation of institutions ' programmes we accredit higher education institutions ' programmes of training in teaching and learning . continuing professional development ( cpd ) we are working with institutions to develop an accreditation framework to encompass a wider range of continuing professional development activity . professional standards framework the academy has developed national professional standards in teaching and learning in higher education on behalf of scop , uuk and the uk funding councils . supporting new academic staff -

in during the quiz and marvelling at the lack of knowledge some sf fans seem to display . only roy kettle and malcolm edwards seemed to have the slightest idea what was actually going on and i was n't too suprised when malcolm won . another winner was rob jackson who this year won the nova award for maya . i feel that although the award itself is quite laudable the rules and actual process for adjudging the nominated fanzines could be adjusted somewhat to avoid any confusion at a future date . for example : nominations should close at a set date say one month before the convention and the judges subsequently chosen as opposed to the current practice of selecting the judges first , this to avoid as far as possible any bias among those giving the award . i also feel that the rules should specify whether the award is for the best issue during the year or the best series of issues . venue for novacon 6 had yet to be decided but the committee have anounced that dave kyle will be guest of honour . people john piggott is now secretary of the national games club . if you 're interested in becoming involved in postal games of any description then contact john at the editorial address ( he lives here too ) . ian williams and harry bell are planning a joint venture into the childrens illustrated story - book market . naturally enough ian will be writing and harry illustrating . ian has apparantly already completed the first draft and intends re - writing it in the near future . bob shaw has turned full - time writer and given up his job with vickers in barrow - in - furness . mary legg is currently vacationing in the states . paul s. ritz ( c / o the mythopoeic society , university hall , box 55 , b.g.s.u. bowling green , ohio 43403 , usa . ) and other members of the local mythopeic group have decided to produce an address list for sf / fantasy people . also they 're thinking of reviving the old tolkein society . if you want to be listed contact paul at the above address . paul kincaid , 20 sherbourne road , middleton , manchester , m24 3eh . mike scantlebury , flat2 , 1 palatine road , withington , manchester , m20 9lh . are new members of the mad group and would like to receive fanzines . mike , i seem to recall , was a bristol fan in the old days . fanzine news maya 9 commemorating 5 years of gannetfandom is due out shortly . this issue will feature a major article by ian williams on the growth of the group since he founded it late in 1970 . accompanying the article will be a photo feature of past and present gannetfen . dave rowe and bernie peek are collaborating on a new fanzine to be titled k . 90 % fannish says dave . convention news beneluxcon 4 , 15 -

writer in a remarkably short time and i 'm sure she could write about many other subjects with equal skill . there is also a substantial letter column ; unfortunately ian left himself very little space for his own writing this time , which is a pity as ian can write with the best of them as long as he does n't get too introspective . this would n't matter so much , except that 2 1/2 pages of this issue are totally wasted on ' discussion ' of chip delany 's dhalgren . not that there 's anything to discuss : it 's the most dreadful book of the year and , if it ever got onto an award ballot , would probably come second to runts of 61 cygni c. even introspective ian would be more interesting than this ! this issue is printed professionally and , as you 'd expect , looks extremely smart . ian bleats a little at the beginning about how much it 's costing him ; frankly i think it 's always worthwhile spending extra money to guarantee a decent - looking product , especially when the standard of writing is as high as it is here , and of course one can hardly go wrong with litho provided a few elementary precautions are taken . certainly some of the harry bell illoes in this issue would not have reproduced satisfactorarily in mimeo . anyway , all in all this is a great issue from one of our best editors . i 'll stick my neck out and even say it may be worth the 35p he 's asking for . still , getting it free was one of the better things to happen to me this year .... rather like coming fifth in the national scrabble champoinship , i suppose . knockers from neptune 2 , mike and pat meara , 61 borrowash rd . , spondon , derby , de2 7qh . available for loc , trade , old fanzines or $ percopy . this is a personalzine in diary format and , as expected , it is n't particularly good . diary - type fanzines neevr are , and i 'll tell you why : the editor needs to take far less trouble over this type of zine than when producing a conventionally - structured one , and natuarally the reader suffers . with an incompetent editor , indeed , disaster ensues . despite these harsh words i have to admit that kfn is the least bad example of the diary fanzine i 've seen in some time . i suspect that most of this is because the mearas can string words together in reasonably correct english ; and because they have an instinctive grasp of the rules of layout so that , even unplanned , their zine looks all right . it 's difficult to say anything about the actual contents : varied would be a fair description . i cavilled at the ' fantastic free gift ' inside ; it turned out to be an unfunny limerick between two computer cards . and i do n't see why they started the page numbers where the first issue left off , unless it was to fool keith freeman ( in his vector review ) , in which case they succeeded beautifully . it 's been opined that to enjoy this and similar fanzines you should read just a few pages each day . presumably by the time you finish , a new issue should be on its way ! whether you think the mearas are interesting enough characters to warrant their being permanent bedside companions is another matter altogether ; i know what i 'd answer , which is that i 'd prefer to see another issue of their erstwhile genzine lurk , insipid as it undoubtedly was . parker 's patch 2 , see coa for address . available for the usual , no price listed . i 'm glad to say this one is pretty good , although the reproduction could best be described as ' traditional british ' ( just readable ) . there will now be a short interlude while i deal with the men with big sticks ..... over half the zine is taken up with the writings of one don west , a fan of uncertain though lengthy vintage whose appearances up to now have been confined to the odd letter and a few cartoons . in view of this , the quality of his fanzine reviews is surprising ; i find them interesting and perceptive , showing a refreshingly cynical regard for the realities of fandom ! i wish i could say the same the same for his other contribution , a tedious and unfunny exposition involving jumbling up people 's names in order to get something ' amusing ' . example : greg pickersgill becomes ' er ? er ? sick pill , ggg ' . like , wow . parker has a nice editorial at the start ; he does n't say a lot except that he 's soon to become a ' doc , but it 's pleasant stuff to read . the letter column is interesting ; i found peter roberts ' reminiscences therein fairly amusing : ' i remember when greg pickersgill wrote letters beinning " dear mr. roberts" .... i seem to have wandered off the point somewhat : the main thing is that this is a good zine and worthy of support . scabby tales 1 , john brosnan , see coa for address . available for the usual . brosnan 's return to fan -

" aniseed is often used as an ingredient in dog food and the seeds may be used to lay drag hunt trails and also by anti - blood sport movements to put hounds off the scent . hound trailing is a sport which takes place all over the lake district between april and october . it dates back over 200 years . individual owners get their hounds fit , then take them to race meetings , which are held most days throughout the summer . the hounds run a circular route of 10 miles ( 5 miles for 1st season puppies ) , over field and fell , following a strong aniseed and paraffin scent . owners and spectators wait at the meet where bets are laid on the outcome . apart from a few premier races , the winnings are small . to make your dog purr , buy him or her a container of lucies farm anissed dog cookies . price per 500 g package : � 7.75 ( excluding : vat at 17.5 % ) doggie biscotti biscotti are hard italian cookies --- biscotti means " baked twice " --- usually dunked in coffee or hot chocolate . but if your dogs have strong jaws and like to chew ( just like our english bull terriers ) these hard cookies are perfect . they come in a mixed package : aniseed ( the " catnip for dogs " ) and banana . price per 500 g package : � 7.75 ( excluding : vat at 17.5 % ) oatmeal & carob dipped dog cookies oatmeal with hand -

the shield of export ! plans to launch a czech / english subtitled version of our film bata - ville next month are taking us down some bizarre alleyways . last week i sold a bit ( more ) of my soul for some funding , by attending an ' export ' course to encourage me to see our new ' product ' as financially viable ..... for an artist , being on a department of trade & industry course and pumped with business & management speak for two days is actually rather exotic and fascinating . judging from my blase classmates though , for the average business person it 's a bit of a busman 's holiday . nevertheless , we had a laugh arranging the 49 steps of ' market entry ' for any new export product ( ours was ' golf holidays for european visitors " - incredibly relevant for my projected dvd sales ) , and i even managed to get a business man to the point of giving up his deskjob by simply describing my average working week attractively . lunch was pretty lavish considering , so i really could n't complain . the most complicated exercise was coming up with a ' shield of export ' for your proposed product and company . the pressure was on for me , what with my profile within the group as the ' arty one ' . as it was , the only distinguishing factor of my effort was the sight ' 3d ' effect of my drawing . the men that were launching shower enclosures in dubai and the man that was marketing steam - boat trips ( i 'm not making this up ) did rather well , though a globe in the shields ' centres became a shortcut to articulating ' world domination ' as ones ultimate ambition in life . i thought ' world domination ' was a given in any business scenario , so had downscaled my own ambition ( having been coached for 15 hours on realism -

grow . there are currently 16 species in the hypopomidae and these are assigned to the genera hypopomus , brachyhypopomus , microsternarchus , steatogenys and hypopygus . the members of this family tend to live within aquatic substrates such as leaf litter or floating meadow . they are often highly resistant to low oxygen levels . they have small mouths and feed on micro -

bodied knife fish reaching a length of more than 20 cm . it is the only species within the taruma - mirim with vertical banding along the full length of the body . it has a large mouth . colour : dark background with white bands . habitat : leaf -

litter banks in small streams , i have suddenly realized that a large specimen has silently moved close by , perhaps attracted by the disturbance . thankfully , they do not discharge unless threatened or during capture of their prey . media browser -

a deep and all - pervading chiaroscuro that hides all the rough edges and angles ( i 'd guess the designers hung around the caravaggio exhibition a lot ) . nevertheless , it 's a testament to how close the computer - generated virtual world can now get to the virtual world of the hollywood movie , and i 'm sure the gap will continue to close at an ever faster pace . notice i did n't use the phrase " real world " at all in the above sentence , because of course the world of live - action movies is every bit as virtual as any computer game . they 're both just representations , neither of which can convincingly simulate a third dimension ( those helmets never did catch on ) nor solidity . most tellingly , both operate on only two of our senses , sight and hearing , which is no coincidence since those two senses are rather different from the rest . a naive critic of virtual reality might complain that computers can show us only the surface of things , but , of course , so do our own senses . they deliver to us images of an external world that our brains then interpret as composed of remote objects surrounding us and distributed in space . in the case of both sight and hearing , no contact with these external objects is necessary : only reflected or emitted light rays pass through our corneas , and only aerial compression waves batter our eardrums , never the things that emit them ( hopefully ) . by contrast , our other senses require material contact with advertisement the external object , some part of which may actually penetrate our bodily perimeter : tasting and smelling both involve ingesting quantities of foreign substances , and the difference between a touch and a skin - piercing wound is only a few pounds of extra pressure . the world these senses depict ( the world of the deaf - and - blind ) lies at much closer range - it lacks vistas or landscapes . however , it does n't for that reason lack in powerful emotional stimuli : on the contrary , these senses carry more emotional charge than either sight or sound as they depend on us having a body . sight and sound are fully detached from the objects they detect , so a being without a body - like a pc - can far more easily simulate them . computer graphics will soon overtake the performance of the human eye to create images that we ca n't distinguish from reality . after all , our eyes and ears are digital devices too - the retinal rods and cones , and the ear 's cochlear hairs are their equivalent of ccds . their bandwidth is fairly modest and well within the abilities of modern silicon . in fact , the average human being 's senses gather data at approximately 11mb / sec , divided between the individual senses as follows : sight , 10mb / sec ; touch , 1mb / sec ; hearing , 100kb / sec ; smell , 100kb / sec ; taste , 1kb / sec . cognitive science experiments suggest that the conscious mind is capable of processing only about 50 bits per second , so most processing must proceed unconsciously and with a stunning degree of data compression . however , our brain does much more than just process pictures and noises : it integrates all our sensory inputs to make us believe in a persistent , solid world that contains other agents besides ourselves who may have intentions toward us . we even have special brain circuits for interpreting other animals ' facial expressions . nothing we see is emotionally neutral , it 's either good for us or bad for us , and is tagged as such in memory . and not everything we see necessarily exists : the brain continually calls on memory to fill in those parts of the world it lacks the bandwidth to monitor in real - time , to say nothing of dreams , daydreams , imagination and hallucinations . just like a virtual - reality computer , the brain can dip into its database to create worlds from the inside , in addition to perceiving the one outside ._. _ _ devil and the deep blue sea diamond in the rough diamond is forever differently abled does n't know shit from shinola dog days dog in the manger dog 's bollocks dog 's breakfast done a runner done to a turn donkey 's years do n't change horses in midstream do n't go there do n't keep a dog and bark yourself do n't let the bastards grind you down do n't look a gift horse in the mouth do n't try to teach your grandma to suck eggs do n't upset the apple -

based facilities such as eiscat , spear and cutlass will provide valuable data about the processes in the sun , the outflow of energy and the effects of variations in solar inputs on energy transfer to the magnetosphere , ionosphere , thermosphere and mesosphere ._. _ _ in this section you will find insights into what the digital future might look like , examples of creative applications of new media , and views on how new technologies can support learning in a changing world . see the archive pages for links to all of our past articles . please contact us if you would like to write an article for our site . the future of history by kim thomas there was a time when the only resources history teachers had at their disposal were textbooks . these days ict has the potential to make a vast pool of information and research tools available to students . kim thomas takes a look at the history classroom of the future . how can ict impact upon the development of thinking skills at key stage 3 ? by matt buxton , djanogly city academy nottingham a city academy based in nottingham is looking at how the two areas of ict and thinking skills might be used in conjunction with one another to improve students ' learning . telly for teachers by kim thomas teachers ' tv celebrated its first birthday by announcing that it now has more than 1,000 programmes on its website . kim thomas talked to martin trickey , director of interactive at the channel , to find out more about how the past year has gone and what he 's planning next . it 's all in the mind by kim thomas bristol university academic dr paul howard -

from the turn of the century to the 1970 's - will be on show to whet investor 's appetites in one of the most interesting investment displays ever seen . many of the toys will be from up and coming auctions . in recent years toys have risen in value by leaps and bounds far outstripping the stock market , banks and building societies . now vectis is to bring its expertise to investors , from those who wish to just invest just a few pounds to those who wish to spend considerably more . vectis 's knowledge of toys and an understanding of what collectors and investors are looking for are two of the things that has enabled the auction house to grow from a small specialised company , running a few toy sales in the south of england , to a multi million pound business . " the fact of the matter is that toys are now big business " , said bryan goodall , and to many they are the perfect investment . you can get great fun from owning them and all the while they are growing in value . in the last year alone mint and boxed dinky toys have risen by some 18 % and there is no sign that this trend will slow down . on the contrary toys seem to increase all the time . goodall added : " collecting toys for investment is something which is open to even the smallest investor , unlike many other areas of the investment market . a few hundred pounds invested wisely every month can result in a collection or portfolio that can be worth thousands and it is great fun along the way . investors can buy at auction , at toy fairs or on the internet and if they wish we will buy for them " . vectis is to set up a number of schemes for potential investors , from simply sending catalogues of forthcoming sales to sending investors lists of particular toys that they may be interested in buying or simply just building a portfolio using specific funds " some investors wish us just to use our expertise to buy a general portfolio of toys that will grow in value . others have specific ideas about what they wish us to look for , from dinky toys to model trains or tinplate toys from the turn of the century from the famous german makers like marklin and bing " , said bryan goodall , a toy collector himself and is proud of the fact that his collection will be a great investment for his grandchildren . he added : " the important point to remember is that if you are buying a toy as an investment , it needs to be in mint condition and in its original box if it is to grow in value and gain the right return . we have never really seen the market drop out of toys and i do n't believe it ever will . nothing is ever certain and like the stock market values can go down as well as up . the trend however will always be up although it may not be just as fast as it has been this year . the fact of the matter is that there are a growing number of collectors and these toys are not being made any more " . � copyright 1999 - 2006 , vectis auctions limited , all rights reserved ._. _ _ virtual call centres -- part 2 - technology by jonty pearce in the second part of our look at virtual call centres we take a look at some of the technology driving virtual call centres . up until recently virtual call centres had been held back by three main concerns - voice quality , security and reliability . but in the past 12 months there has been a significant shift in the take - up rate of virtual call centres . according to jim davies , contact centre analyst of gartner , " we have been told for years that ip has been coming in the next 12 months , but we now predict that next year shipments of ip contact centres will overtake that of traditional tdm based contact centres " . but are people really deploying virtual call centres , or are they just hedging their bets and buying a technology that is more future proof ? " i think that many people are deploying ip contact centres in the way that they have deployed traditional tdm systems , " says mike thomas , group contact centre architect for the power company centrica . " the cabling is often completely separate from the data network " . there is no doubt that there has recently been an increase in confidence in ip technology that has fuelled the take - up in ip contact centres . but what has come of the three main concerns - voice quality , reliability and security ? voice quality as more people have started to implement ip - based voice systems they have discovered that the voice quality is not as big an issue for end users as they had originally expected . " ip voice systems can now deliver full quality business telephony audio , but ironically , if you look at gsm , for example , people have become very tolerant of poor voice quality in business when using mobile phones , " says nigel jones , marketing and business development manager of alcatel . conventional 64 kbs pcm voice systems will limit audio bandwidth to approximately 3.4khz , however some new ip voice systems can support larger bandwidth - if it is available on the network , giving virtually hifi quality . this means that a better range of voice frequencies can be heard . " providing the ip network can support these increased bandwidths , this will start to offer new improved levels of voice quality services for end users , " says nigel jones . in fact , the voice quality is so good that many of the new generation of sip ( ethernet ) ip phones are having to inject a low level ' comfort noise ' . this background noise is used purely so that during pauses in the conversation , callers know that they are still connected . reliability the other issue that has now largely been resolved is that of reliability . servers and pcs have become much more reliable in the past three years . server technology and processor power has increased by leaps and bounds and so has the reliability of the operating systems . it is now possible to buy highly redundant and highly scalable linux servers which can be backed up across the wan . also the general perception of reliability has changed as desktop pcs have become more reliable . it was not uncommon for a windows 95 or 98 pc to lock up on you - often several times a week . with the higher power pcs and microsoft 's xp operating system - it is rare for a pc to completely lock up . this improvement has tended to lessen the overall perception of reliability as an issue . linux is also used by some telephony vendors for communications voice servers which can provide proven 99.999 % availability - comparable with legacy pbxs . another advantage of linux based systems is their resistance to worms and viruses which can often infect windows based operating systems if the appropriate anti - virus measures are not in place . the reliability of voice quality has also improved as more companies have built ip networks that support quality of service ( qos ) . qos based networks allow business data and real time critical voice ip packets to co - exist on the same network , but ensure high priority voice packets get to their destination first - so there are no glitches in audio quality . " people were trying to cut corners by running ip voice on the existing non qos data network - which caused the bad voice quality problems , even though the basic ip telephony system worked fine , " says nigel jones . " now they have built a complete new ip network and have upgraded it to include quality of service " . the network is now typically segmented so that both voice and data are carried on separate vlans . security security of ip systems has also improved considerably over the past few years . companies that are concerned about security are using encryption systems such as talis . for those companies that need security in their network , " there is nothing to fear anymore , " says dave thomson , marketing manager for cisco . but simply adding encryption onto a network is not all plain sailing . " it makes things such as voice recording much more difficult , " says nathan george of witness systems . " you ca n't just put a pair of crocodile clips across two wires and start recording any more " . when the voice traffic is encrypted you have to be able to either record at the gateway level , as calls come into the call centre , or you have to be passed the key . this need for multiple vendors to have the security key is causing its own security problems . obviously the more people who have the key , the less the secure it becomes . this has led to the ip system providers like avaya and nortel acting as the security systems ' integrator and managing the deployment of the voice recording systems . where next for the virtual call centre ? there is one area where the virtual call centre has yet to go -- and this is in the field of presence enabled applications using sip technology . in the next issue we will be exploring sip and finding out where this will take the virtual call centre ._. _ _ the history of cranfield airfield by bernice maynard [ return to cranfield express home page ] [ return to cranfield 's airfield history index page ] a short history of cranfield airfield the first ten years - by bernice maynard the new aerodrome at cranfield was intended to strengthen the lines of air defence in the eastern counties and to provide a link in the chain of aerodromes from the wash to the lower thames . undertaking construction of an elaborate airfield in the 1930 's was a tremendous task . even acquiring the ground for landing areas was complicated as the best agricultural land was also the best for smooth flat airfield use . the air ministry 's negotiations for the purchase of about 400 acres of land were almost complete by march 1935 - the ministry making arrangements to take possession of most of the land on 24th june of that year . work began in august 1935 and it took just under two years for it to be completed . cranfield aerodrome was opened 1 june 1937 under the control of no 1 bomber group . the first aeroplanes to arrive were the hinds of 108 squadron from farnborough , soon to be followed by further hinds of 82 and 62 squadrons . cranfield 's operational contingent of three dozen hinds was then complete . by the time of the munich crisis in september 1938 no 108 had moved to bassingbourn and the hinds of the other two squadrons had been replaced by blenheim 1 's . following the munich crisis , training became more realistic , fuel consumption trials took place as did training flights over france . in august 1939 no 62 squadron were sent to the far east and singapore and no 82 moved to watton . nos 35 and 207 squadrons then arrived from cottesmore , in fairey battles , to take their place . both these squadrons provided replacement pilots and observer / gunners for nos 15 and 40 squadrons in france . thirty men trained each six week period . these squadrons departed in late 1939 leaving servicing flight only . three hardened runways were then being built to replace the original grass ones and it was only possible for aircraft to take off at cranfield . slow progress in the runway construction forced servicing flight to move to upwood in february 1940 . once the runways were completed , a change overtook cranfield . forced out of kinloss , the airspeed oxford trainers of no 14 service flying training school ( sfts ) moved in . the oxford trainers were later joined by havards and in june 1940 30 miles master aircraft were delivered to replace havards . no . 14 sfts stayed at cranfield until moving to lyneham early in august 1941 , and were replaced by a new unit . no 51 operational training unit ( otu ) opened on august 25 1941 offering night fighter crews courses mainly on blenheims . this assumed major importance and cranfield acquired a satellite at twinwood . august 1942 saw the first of the beaufighters for 51 otu arrive . march 1943 , nos 181 and 183 squadrons stayed here and snarling sabres shattered the air during exercise spartan . during march / april 1943 , seven wellington x1s arrived to train 100 group mosquito crews . no 3501 servicing unit was set up to handle overhauls of fighters . there were plenty of pilots available for flight testing , because no 3501 pilot replacement unit was also here until september 1944 when it was moved to middle wallop . in may / june 1943 americans came to learn to operate a1 mkv111 american marked beaufighters . no 51 otu were still here with equipment at that time listed as:- 78 beaufighter 1fs ( a1 mk 1v ) , 4 beaufighter vifs , 4 beaufighter 1fs without a1 , 10 blenheim vs ( dual control ) , 6 beauforts , 3 blenheim 1s , 1 blenheim 1v , 3 lysanders , 5 martinets , 4 magisters and 1 dominie . in july 1944 mosquito 11 's started to supplement 51 otus beaufighters until in february 1945 the last beaufighter was withdrawn . no 51 otu disbanded june 14 1945 and during the last week of june , the remaining mosquitoes , beaufighters and beauforts were flown away . canadian and australian airmen who were here were also starting for home . by the end of august 1945 all of cranfield 's aircraft had gone . several airmen stationed at cranfield lost their lives in the war and some of these lie in cranfield churchyard . the first airman to be buried was p / o david shine age 19 of no 62 squadron . his home was tipperary , ireland . his blenheim bomber crashed on 22 march 1939 near kettering , northamptonshire , 6 months before the war even began . this was the first military funeral to take place in cranfield . another grave at cranfield is that of sgt . stanley john newcombe of no 14 sfts . he was buried 12 august 1940 . this was the pilot of master n7717 which crashed during night flying , a few days earlier . for trying to save the life of sgt . newcombe and two other members of the crew by dashing into their blazing aircraft a / c vivian hollowday was awarded the george cross . a / c hollowday had only just been released from hospital having one month earlier dashed into another blazing aircraft on the airfield boundary in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the pilot of that aeroplane . he survived his near fatal burns and was awarded the george cross for his bravery - the first member of the raf to receive this honour . the empire test pilots school ( etps ) moved to cranfield from boscombe down in november 1945 . group captain h j wilson ( commandant etps ) broke the world speed record , in his meteor 1v at herne bay 7 november 1945 , reaching an average speed of 606 mph . he arrived at cranfield a week later where he was given a welcome party in the officer 's mess . the following day geoffrey de havilland flew into cranfield and had lunch in the officer 's mess . a month earlier de havilland had made an unscheduled stop here due to his vampire running short of fuel . the first etps course opened at cranfield 2 january 1946 using lancasters , mosquito v1s , boston 111s , meteor 111s , spitfire 1xs , tempest 11s and vs , oxfords , harvards , a dominie , a swordfish and a tiger moth . post - war needs for test pilots in britain and many other parts of the world were met by etps graduates . cranfield 's future was assured in 1946 when the college of aeronautics , a government sponsored institution , was founded . some of the college 's original equipment came from german research establishments . in august 1947 the empire test pilots school moved to farnborough , but the college of aeronautics remained now forming part of cranfield university . sources of information action stations 6 : military airfields of the cotswolds and central midlands by michael j f bowyer . the guinness book of air facts and feats by john w r taylor , michael j h taylor and david mondey . bedfordshire times 26 april 1935 bedfordshire times 23 august 1935 bedfordshire times 24 march 1939 cranfield burial registers operations record book no 14 sfts operations record book no 51 otu operations record book raf station cranfield ._. _ _ a dash from diamond city george manville fenn | next chapter | | previous chapter | | contents | chapter xvi . after a rest . west started up into wakefulness the next morning from a dream in which he was galloping for his life with the boers in full pursuit , and then he sighed and wondered when and how he had dropped asleep , for he could only recall being miserable , awake , and puzzled as to what to do , and then all seemed to have become blank till he was awakened by his captors ' busy stir and the crackling of the fires being lighted . west 's first steps were to see to his companion , who did not seem to have moved , and the first feeling was one of satisfaction ; but directly afterwards he felt uneasy , for ingleborough seemed to be unnaturally still , and a shiver ran through him as he leaned over where his friend lay on the floor of the wagon , to place a hand upon the injured man 's forehead below the bandage which made him look so ghastly . then came reaction as it was proved that the sufferer had only been in a deep sound sleep . for ingleborough 's eyes opened , to gaze at him wonderingly . " what 's the matter ? oh , it 's you , noll ! " " yes ; you startled me ! " " eh ? what did i do ? " " you lay so still ! " " did i ? oh , of course . i 've been very fast asleep , i suppose . what time it is -- nearly sundown ? " " no , it 's morning -- sunrise . " " i 'm blessed ! what , have i slept all night ? " west nodded and smiled . " soundly , i suppose ! " he said . " but how are you ? " " horribly stupid and muddled ! i do n't quite make out ! oh yes , i do now . i came down such a quelch that it knocked all the sense out of me , and my head feels all knocked on one side . but tell me : what about the despatch ? " " i have it all right so far ! " " that 's good . where are our ponies ? " " tied up yonder to the wheel of a wagon . " " that 's good , too , lad ! then all we 've got to do is to help ourselves to them the first chance and ride away . " " yes , " said west drily , " the first chance ; but will there be a first chance ? " " why not ? it 's of no use to look at the black side of things ! where there 's ill luck there 's always good luck to balance it , and we 're bound to have our share of both . we had the bad yesterday ; the good will come to - morrow , or next day , or the day after -- who knows ? we were not killed . you had your ear nicked and i had a bad fall which will cure itself as fast as the slit in your ear grows up . i call it grand to have saved the despatch ! are they going to give us any breakfast ? " " hah ! " sighed west ; " you 've done me good , ingle . i was regularly in the dumps . " " keep out of them , then ! " was the reply . " you did n't expect to get your message delivered at mafeking without any trouble , did you ? " " no , no , of course not ! then you think we might make a dash for it some time ? " " of course i do ; but i do n't suppose the chance will come to - day . let 's hope that our next move may take us nearer our goal , for i do n't suppose the boers will take us with them . they 'll send us prisoners to pretoria , i suppose ; and we must make our dash somewhere on the road . " ingleborough was right : the chance for the dash did not come that day , nor the next , nor the next . for the boer commando did not stir from the natural stronghold which had been made its halting - place . in fact , two fresh parties , for which there was plenty of room , joined them , and a good deal of business went on : men going out on expeditions and returning : wagons laden with provisions and ammunition and two big field - pieces arriving , as if the force was being increased ready for some important venture -- all of which busy preparation took place under the eyes of the two prisoners , who , while being fairly well treated in the way of rations , were carefully guarded . " one would like to know a little more what it all means ! " said ingleborough . " as it is , one seems to be quite in the dark ! " " and we 're doing nothing ! " sighed west . " oh , it 's terrible ! i must begin to stir , even if it is only to bring about another check . " " what would be the good of that ? " " ease to one 's brain ! " said west passionately . " here have i been trusted with this mission and am doing nothing , while all the time the poor fellows at mafeking must be watching despairingly for the despatch that does not come . " " look here , old lad , " said ingleborough sympathetically ; " when a fellow 's chained down hand and foot it 's of no use for him to kick and strain ; he only makes his wrists and ankles sore and weakens himself , so do n't do it ! believe me , the proper time to act is when they take you out of your chains ! it 's very depressing , i know ; but what ca n't be cured-- " " must be endured . i know , ingle ; but here we are prisoners , and i ca n't help getting more hopeless . " " but you must ! things ca n't go on like this much longer ! either our troops will come here and attack the boers , or the boers will go and attack the british . just have patience and wait ! " " but here we are , just as we were nearly a week ago , and nothing has happened . " " oh yes , something has ! " said ingleborough , with a smile . " i 've got well again ! the first morning i could n't have mounted my pony and ridden off even if they had brought it to the end of the wagon here and said : ' be off ! ' to - day i could jump on and go off at full gallop . do you call that nothing ? " " no , of course not ! " said west . " there , you must forgive me ! i 'm very discontented , i know ; but you see why . " " to be sure i do ! i say , though , you 've been at that satchel ! the sandwiches are gone . " west nodded . " have n't eaten them , have you ? " " no , they 're sewed up in the belt of my jacket . i did it two nights ago , and i 'm living in hopes that they will not search us again . " " that 's it , is it ? well , i 'm glad you did that ! there , keep a good heart ; something is sure to happen before long ! " " i only hope it may ; even evil would be better than this miserable state of inaction . i think till i feel half - mad . " " well , we wo n't hope for the evil , only for something in the way of change , if it 's only to pay a visit to pretoria gaol . " " what ! " " only so as to get some news to give to old norton when we get back . it will interest him . i wonder whether he 's keeping his eye on master plump - and - pink . well , i am blessed ! " " what is the matter ? are they making a move ? " cried west excitedly , for ingleborough had sprung to the end of their wagon prison to stand looking out . " someone has ! " cried ingleborough angrily . " look here ! why , old norton must have been asleep .

( and whilst on the subject of inactive loch steamers , check out http://www.lochtaysteam heritage.co.uk/ for another sorry tale . ) on 2 august , the herald finally reported the merlin takeover as a goer . but watch this space - both advocates for animals and animal concern are marshalling opposition to what they see as a new and unnecessary " zoo " . the big " visitor attractions " , at least those where shopping is not the raison d' � tre , have tended to struggle . the problems at the glasgow science centre are well - documented , the big idea inventor centre at irvine has gone already , and the archaeolink archaeology park near insch has recently had to be taken over by the local council . if it closes before 2007 , � 2 m of european funding will have to be repaid . expect it to last until then , and close soon after . there are two rhegeds in the grampian - cairngorms area . one , the house of bruar - plonked insensitively beside the glen bruar right - of - way - is booming because it is a 100 % shopping facility . ( hamster - fur coats and all - ed . ) the other is our very own mountain rheged , the ptarmigan complex on cairn gorm . as predicted in tac and elsewhere , the visitor assessments made by funicular operators cairngorm mountain proved to be over - optimistic , and they are agitating for the repeal of the closed system whereby funicular travellers must not leave the ptarmigan . they promised they would n't do this , but then we always knew they would anyway . the closed system will be scrapped , for sure . anyway , the broad track that forms the main walking route from the car park to cairn gorm is , these days , even more of an eyesore than the funicular - i suspect most of the ptarmigan 's supplies are delivered using that rather than the trains . on two recent visits to cairn gorm summit , i encountered a supposedly elusive snow bunting hopping around the cairn , begging for scraps . perhaps the wildlife demographic is saying : " bring on the tourists " . whatever doubts outdoor people and environmentalists have about the funicular - and i have many - the thing is there now , it 's not going away , and passengers will , eventually , be let loose on the open hill . at least it 's a relief to see that some of the flora and fauna are willing to adapt to living in a tourist honeypot . ed . - the end of the closed system for the funicular came a step closer with the early - september announcement that the 3500-acre cairngorm estate is being put up for sale by highlands and islands enterprise . it includes the ski and railway areas , and the summit , and there is talk of either a community buyout or the whole caboodle being taken over by the national park authority . the proposed sale prompted fergus ewing msp to make a comment that was startling in its openness : " under no circumstances should it fall into the hands of any of the conservation bodies who fought tooth and nail against the funicular . " there has also been a development in the car park beside the funicular lower station . making his first summer visit since 1982 , richard webb noticed that drivers are being asked for a � 1 donation to help fund environmental improvement . given how much the northern corries have been systematically trashed by the authorities and big business over several decades , this seems a tad rich . oh , and come tac67 , one of tac 's resident artists will review the extraordinary goose -

tech equipment . they have cherry picked and exploited local labour only to dump them when they see fit . � � � � � � � � � � � the trend of closures is linked to the transnational and multinational corporations ' desires to be able to switch areas of production , export capital , when they want , contrary to any particular nation 's interests . this aspect of globalisation is key when it comes to opposing the capitalists � � right � to do such a thing , and an alternative economic strategy has to be developed in order to maintain manufacture as a viable portion of the economy . by this is not meant that the workers should � save the day � for the capitalists , but that they have a programme for the economy which puts the needs of the people at the centre , where they take control of what belongs to them , and in which the people are empowered to set the direction for the economy . � � � � � � � � � � � another aspect of the problem is linked to privatisation of railways and the lack of support for an important social programme such as rail transport . the rail network is in terminal crisis in britain due to lack of investment . the alternative is to increase investments in social programmes . the dire consequences of adverse policies can be seen by what is happening at the alstom complex that wants to shift work to spain from britain in 2004 . this includes traditional london underground work , where alstom has just won a � 101 million contract to build trainsets and trailer cars for the jubilee line . � � � � � � � � � � � if the workers are to save the day , they must come out of the margins and oppose the plan . it becomes essential that the workers take up the politics surrounding the issues . there is a requirement that worker politicians come forward at present . article index two unison press releases unison speaks out against war in iraq 20/06/2003 a motion highly critical of the government � s stance on iraq was carried overwhelmingly by the unison conference in brighton today . � � � � � � � � � � � keith sonnet , deputy general secretary of unison , told the conference that the union completely and utterly condemns the british government � s decision to support military action in iraq . � � � � � � � � � � � keith sonnet told the conference that the war was � illegal under international law , unjustified , undermining the un , causing so much suffering to innocent people . � � � � � � � � � � � � we condemn the deceit , manipulation and downright lies used to justify war . we condemn the hypocrisy of the british and american governments who for years supported and sold arms and weapons to saddam hussein . we condemn our prime minister , a labour prime minister , for being the conduit between bush , berlusconi , asnar and howard . the right wing axis of evil . we know only too well the need for regime change . � � � � � � � � � � � � we pay tribute and salute the millions who demonstrated against the war . particularly the historic demonstrations on 15 february in london , glasgow and belfast but also in every town and city . we congratulate the stop the war coalition . we will continue to support and work with them . � � � � � � � � � � � � we are horrified at the reported civilian casualties � up to 7200 but probably much higher , since it � s the policy not to count the iraqi dead . thousands more maimed and injured . we are sorry for the families of all those killed and those injured . � � � � � � � � � � � " they were killed and injured by 18467 smart bombs 9251 dumb bombs 802 cruise missiles 908 guided cluster bombs 311597 rounds of 30 mm ammunition 16901 rounds of 20 mm ammunition 400,000 troops in iraq and the region 1801 aircraft � � � � � � � � � � � � and it cost $ 20 billion and $ 2 billion each month with the continuing casualties . and what was all this for ? so far , two trailers for producing hydrogen gas for artillery balloons . rumsfeld says that the iraqis may have destroyed their wmd before the war started . isn � t this what we asked them to do ? didn � t the un weapons inspectors reports really confirm this ? � � � � � � � � � � � � conference , has the war made the world a safer place ? no , just the opposite . it � s increased the risk of international terrorism . we are all less safe now . � � � � � � � � � � � � if , as our prime minister said , the price of our special relationship with america has to be paid in blood . i say end it now . � � � � � � � � � � � � if bush and blair genuinely wanted a safer world then they would use their muscle and strength to force a peace settlement in the middle east . one that creates an independent palestinian state alongside a secure israel . as we demand , they would stop selling arms to ariel sharon who should instead be tried as a war criminal . � � � � � � � � � � � � saddam hussein and his evil regime have gone . good . but , the iraqi war was about none of these things but all about the need for oil and the self - interest of american business . conference , we have seen it all before , with ho chi min , castro , allende , ortega to name a few and now probably lula and chavez . all because of american corporations and self - interest . � � � � � � � � � � � � emergency motion 1 sets out the action we demand to restore iraq to the people of iraq . we do not stand shoulder to shoulder with right wing republicans in washington . we stand shoulder to shoulder with the suffering people of iraq and with the palestinians in their struggle for freedom , peace and justice . � unison conference says no to pfi and privatisation 20/06/2003 dave anderson , unison nec , speaking at the union � s national conference in brighton today , underlined the union � s opposition to pfi and privatisation and highlighted the earlier decision made by conference on the union � s political fund . � � � � � � � � � � � he said : � anything we do in relation to our political funds will be determined by the clear decisions reached by you on wednesday and the assurances given by our general secretary , which had the overwhelming support of conference . � � � � � � � � � � � our support for this amendment rests in our strong opposition to pfi and privatisation and in taking a united campaign forward . � � � � � � � � � � � but nobody should read into that , that our position on our political funds has changed . � � � � � � � � � � � that message must go out very clearly from this conference � both to the media and other political commentators who may wish to � spin � another line . conference this debate is about our anti - privatisation campaign . the work with the political funds is only part of that . in our wider campaign : � � � � � � � � � � � � we will continue to work through every avenue open to us : - 1 ) commissioning research 2 ) organising seminars at the highest level 3 ) building and developing our anti - privatisation coalition 4 ) using the bargaining agenda to defend our member � s rights 5 ) and yes comrades , using our industrial muscle in line with agreements reached earlier this week . conference � there is an ever - reducing core of people in this country who still support the privatisation agenda � � � � � � � � � � � � they are real focus of conservatism � they are the ones stuck in the time warp � and they are the ones who are preventing the development of real world class public services this is our defining issue we are the public service union , whoever employs us . we will never give up this campaign and we will do it not out of self - interest , but out of our core belief in the work we do and the services we deliver . � article index bush 's vietnam by john pilger , 19 june 2003 in a cover story for the new statesman , john pilger reports from afghanistan and describes the ' unfolding disaster ' in that country and in iraq , scenes of america 's two ' great victories ' following 9/11 . once more , we hear that america is being " sucked into a quagmire " . the rapacious adventures in iraq and afghanistan are going badly wrong . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � america 's two " great victories " since 11 september 2001 are unravelling . in afghanistan , the regime of hamid karzai has virtually no authority and no money , and would collapse without american guns . al - qaeda has not been defeated , and the taliban are re - emerging . regardless of showcase improvements , the situation of women and children remains desperate . the token woman in karzai 's cabinet , the courageous physician sima samar , has been forced out of government and is now in constant fear of her life , with an armed guard outside her office door and another at her gate . murder , rape and child abuse are committed with impunity by the private armies of america 's " friends " , the warlords whom washington has bribed with millions of dollars , cash in hand , to give the pretence of stability . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � " we are in a combat zone the moment we leave this base , " an american colonel told me at bagram airbase , near kabul . " we are shot at every day , several times a day . " when i said that surely he had come to liberate and protect the people , he belly - laughed . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � american troops are rarely seen in afghanistan 's towns . they escort us officials at high speed in armoured vans with blackened windows and military vehicles , mounted with machine - guns , in front and behind . even the vast bagram base was considered too insecure for the defence secretary , donald rumsfeld , during his recent , fleeting visit . so nervous are the americans that a few weeks ago they " accidentally " shot dead four government soldiers in the centre of kabul , igniting the second major street protest against their presence in a week . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � on the day i left kabul , a car bomb exploded on the road to the airport , killing four german soldiers , members of the international security force isaf . the germans ' bus was lifted into the air ; human flesh lay on the roadside . when british soldiers arrived to " seal off " the area , they were watched by a silent crowd , squinting into the heat and dust , across a divide as wide as that which separated british troops from afghans in the 19th century , and the french from algerians and americans from vietnamese . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � in iraq , scene of the second " great victory " , there are two open secrets . the first is that the " terrorists " now besieging the american occupation force represent an armed resistance that is almost certainly supported by the majority of iraqis who , contrary to pre - war propaganda , opposed their enforced " liberation " ( see jonathan steele 's investigation , 19 march 2003 , www.guardian . co.uk ) . the second secret is that there is emerging evidence of the true scale of the anglo - american killing , pointing to the bloodbath bush and blair have always denied . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � comparisons with vietnam have been made so often over the years that i hesitate to draw another . however , the similarities are striking : for example , the return of expressions such as " sucked into a quagmire " . this suggests , once again , that the americans are victims , not invaders : the approved hollywood version when a rapacious adventure goes wrong . since saddam hussein 's statue was toppled almost three months ago , more americans have been killed than during the war . ten have been killed and 25 wounded in classic guerrilla attacks on roadblocks and checkpoints which may number as many as a dozen a day . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � the americans call the guerrillas " saddam loyalists " and " ba'athist fighters " , in the same way they used to dismiss the vietnamese as " communists " . recently , in falluja , in the sunni heartland of iraq , it was clearly not the presence of ba'athists or saddamists , but the brutal behaviour of the occupiers , who fired point - blank at a crowd , that inspired the resistance . the american tanks gunning down a family of shepherds is reminiscent of the gunning down of a shepherd , his family and sheep by " coalition " aircraft in a " no - fly zone " four years ago , whose aftermath i filmed and which evoked , for me , the murderous games american aircraft used to play in vietnam , gunning down farmers in their fields , children on their buffaloes . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � on 12 june , a large american force attacked a " terrorist base " north of baghdad and left more than 100 dead , according to a us spokesman . the term " terrorist " is important , because it implies that the likes of al - qaeda are attacking the liberators , and so the connection between iraq and 11 september is made , which in pre - war propaganda was never made . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � more than 400 prisoners were taken in this operation . the majority have reportedly joined thousands of iraqis in a " holding facility " at baghdad airport : a concentration camp along the lines of bagram , from where people are shipped to guantanamo bay . in afghanistan , the americans pick up taxi drivers and send them into oblivion , via bagram . like pinochet 's boys in chile , they are making their perceived enemies " disappear " . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � " search and destroy " , the scorched - earth tactic from vietnam , is back . in the arid south - eastern plains of afghanistan , the village of niazi qala no longer stands . american airborne troops swept down before dawn on 30 december 2001 and slaughtered , among others , a wedding party . villagers said that women and children ran towards a dried pond , seeking protection from the gunfire , and were shot as they ran . after two hours , the aircraft and the attackers left . according to a united nations investigation , 52 people were killed , including 25 children . " we identified it as a military target , " says the pentagon , echoing its initial response to the my lai massacre 35 years ago . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � the targeting of civilians has long been a journalistic taboo in the west . accredited monsters did that , never " us " . the civilian death toll of the 1991 gulf war was wildly underestimated . almost a year later , a comprehensive study by the medical education trust in london estimated that more than 200,000 iraqis had died during and immediately after the war , as a direct or indirect consequence of attacks on civilian infrastructure . the report was all but ignored . this month , iraq body count , a group of american and british academics and researchers , estimated that up to 10,000 civilians may have been killed in iraq , including 2,356 civilians in the attack on baghdad alone . and this is likely to be an extremely conservative figure . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � in afghanistan , there has been similar carnage . in may last year , jonathan steele extrapolated all the available field evidence of the human cost of the us bombing and concluded that as many as 20,000 afghans may have lost their lives as an indirect consequence of the bombing , many of them drought victims denied relief . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � this " hidden " effect is hardly new . a recent study at columbia university in new york has found that the spraying of agent orange and other herbicides on vietnam was up to four times as great as previously estimated . agent orange contained dioxin , one of the deadliest poisons known . in what they first called operation hades , then changed to the friendlier operation ranch hand , the americans in vietnam destroyed , in some 10,000 " missions " to spray agent orange , almost half the forests of southern vietnam , and countless human lives . it was the most insidious and perhaps the most devastating use of a chemical weapon of mass destruction ever . today , vietnamese children continue to be born with a range of deformities , or they are stillborn , or the foetuses are aborted . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � the use of uranium - tipped munitions evokes the catastrophe of agent orange . in the first gulf war in 1991 , the americans and british used 350 tonnes of depleted uranium . according to the united kingdom atomic energy authority , quoting an international study , 50 tonnes of du , if inhaled or ingested , would cause 500,000 deaths . most of the victims are civilians in southern iraq . it is estimated that 2,000 tonnes were used during the latest attack . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � in a remarkable series of reports for the christian science monitor , the investigative reporter scott peterson has described radiated bullets in the streets of baghdad and radiation - contaminated tanks , where children play without warning . belatedly , a few signs in arabic have appeared : " danger - get away from this area " . at the same time , in afghanistan , the uranium medical research centre , based in canada , has made two field studies , with the results described as " shocking " . " without exception , " it reported , " at every bomb site investigated , people are ill . a significant portion of the civilian population presents symptoms consistent with internal contamination by uranium . " � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � an official map distributed to non - government agencies in iraq shows that the american and british military have plastered urban areas with cluster bombs , many of which will have failed to detonate on impact . these usually lie unnoticed until children pick them up , then they explode . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � in the centre of kabul , i found two ragged notices warning people that the rubble of their homes , and streets , contained unexploded cluster bombs " made in usa " . who reads them ? small children ? the day i watched children skipping through what might have been an urban minefield , i saw tony blair on cnn in the lobby of my hotel . he was in iraq , in basra , lifting a child into his arms , in a school that had been painted for his visit , and where lunch had been prepared in his honour , in a city where basic services such as education , food and water remain a shambles under the british occupation . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � it was in basra three years ago that i filmed hundreds of children ill and dying because they had been denied cancer treatment equipment and drugs under an embargo enforced with enthusiasm by tony blair . now here he was - shirt open , with that fixed grin , a man of the troops if not of the people - lifting a toddler into his arms for the cameras . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � when i returned to london , i read " after lunch " , by harold pinter , from a new collection of his called war ( faber & faber ) . � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � and after noon the well - dressed creatures come to sniff among the dead and have their lunch � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � and all the many well - dressed creatures pluck the swollen avocados from the dust and stir the minestrone with stray bones � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � and after lunch they loll and lounge about decanting claret in convenient skulls_nns _ _ the bill gives details of instalment amounts and dates . direct debit payers -

cutting issues 4.6 users , carers and self - help groups 4.6.1 background the nhs and social care act 2001 demands that every nhs body , including drug treatment services , now has a statutory duty to consult and involve patients and the public in its activities . the duty to involve and consult commenced on 1 january 2003 . the department of health is providing guidance on how this can be done via a new system of patient and public involvement . drug service users and their carers can also take advantage of these new opportunities . in every nhs trust there will be a patient advice and liaison service ( pals ) to provide on - the - spot help and information to patients about the trust 's services , including complaints procedures , and advice about local voluntary and self - help groups . pals will be part of each trust . patients ' forums will be set up as independent statutory groups to monitor and review services and to influence the day - to - day management of the trust 's health services and monitor the work of each pals . in every community , local networks will be set up to provide advice and information to local people and to enable them to get involved in their healthcare services . they will do this through local outreach teams which will also support the work of pals and patient forums by bringing them together to share information and lessons that they have learned . local people will be able to join a panel to ensure that the outreach teams are concentrating on issues of real local concern . local overview and scrutiny committees will be set up to inspect regional nhs services . local networks will also employ the services of the independent complaints advocacy services ( icas ) to support people wishing to complain about their healthcare . local networks will be monitored and supported by the national commission for patient and public involvement in health ( see below ) . at national level , the commission for patient and public involvement in health will be an independent organisation that collects , compares and promotes information picked up by its local networks , and by pals and patient forums . it will carry out research , set national quality standards for patient and public involvement , develop and provide training to ensure that local volunteers and representatives are able to meet these standards , and monitor pals , patients ' forums and icas . the department of health is also changing how people can complain about the nhs . a listening exercise was conducted in september 2001 . the feedback obtained was used to construct a final package of measures and a timetable for implementation . this is available on the department of health website : www.doh.gov.uk/involvingpatients . 4.6.2 the nta 's user and carer involvement the nta wishes to advocate partnerships with drug treatment service users and carers , because we recognise that users have the right to become involved in activities that affect their health and well - being . we also respect the unique expertise and experiences of drug users and carers and know the health , esteem and other personal benefits which involvement can bring . the nta will work with drug users , drug treatment services , joint commissioners of drug treatment services and local drug action teams ( dats ) to develop a national strategy for involving users and carers . the nta 's user and carer involvement strategy aims to : make agencies that provide drug treatment services more accountable to service users and carers create more opportunities for people who use , or want to use , drug treatment services to get involved . we are particularly concerned about people whose needs are under - represented by existing services , such as women and black and asian users enable service users to complain about services . we will make the system easier to follow and make sure that it is well advertised . we will also make sure that the general nhs complaints procedures are open to drug treatment service users seek to ensure that specialist drug treatment services are independently monitored be flexible and be based on what works . existing standards on involving service users and carers in the commissioning and provision of drug treatment are set out below . service users should be involved in the planning of local drug treatments services ( substance misuse advisory service 1999 ) . drug treatment service users ( as with any health and social care service user group ) should be regularly consulted on their satisfaction with the treatment provided and should be actively involved in their own care ( alcohol concern and standing conference on drug abuse 1999 ; standing conference on drug abuse 1997b ; department of health 1991 ) . as a matter of good practice , service users should be made aware of complaints ' procedures and local advocacy and support services ( standing conference on drug abuse 1997b ) . a service users charter of rights and responsibilities is built into quads standards for drug and alcohol treatment providers . drug treatment commissioners and providers should ensure that these standards are met ( see box 2 below ) . the nta , in partnership with users , carers , service providers and commissioners , and other parties , will build on this existing good work and provide guidance and implementation to enable the construction of a more patient - centred drug treatment system in line with the nhs plan . 4.6.2.1 self - help networks there are a variety of self - help networks in england . these groups have a variety of purposes , aims and philosophical backgrounds and vary from abstinence - based support networks to advocacy to harm reduction peer interventions . there is an emerging evidence base from the usa that the regular use of self - help groups ( in particular na ) can be beneficial to client outcome from drug treatment . fiorentine and hillhouse ( fiorentine 1997 ; fiorentine and hillhouse 2000 ) have found that attendance at mutual aid groups can improve and sustain outcomes from compatible forms of drug treatment . 4.6.3 types of help 4.6.3.1 advocacy some groups , such as the methadone alliance , advocate for better methadone treatment and provide service - user support networks . a national network of drug users ' support groups now exists . it can be contacted through the national drug users development agency . user - focused magazines such as monkey and black poppy offer another source of information and support for drug users and their families . 4.6.3.2 safer use some agencies ( such as mainliners ) play an active role in harm reduction work , including : peer education in safer drug use and safer sexual behaviour ; first aid training in the event of overdose ; provision of drug - related advice and information ; and service user advocacy . 4.6.3.3 self - help groups the largest of these self - help groups for drug users is the fellowship of narcotics anonymous ( na ) . na is a worldwide self - help network for people trying to remain abstinent from illegal drugs . it is one of the 12-step fellowships borne out of alcoholics anonymous ( aa ) . it has an abstinence - based philosophy and the 12 steps are used to instil a new attitude and develop a drug - free lifestyle . members are encouraged to attend support groups regularly for ongoing support and prevent relapse . in 1997 , na estimated that their london membership alone was 3,000 , with about 20 meetings each day in the capital ( standing conference on drug abuse 1997b ) . mentors work with other members to support them and help them understand the 12 steps . many drug services have active links with na and encourage service users to link with local groups . some drug services host na meetings . another 12-step , fellowship - based , self - help group is cocaine anonymous , although the number of these meetings is much smaller than na . some parts of england may not have na meetings available and many drug users have found attendance at aa meetings , which are much more widely available , a very supportive source of help . 4.6.3.4 carer and family support the needs of carers and families must also be considered in line with the carer ( recognition & services ) act , 1995 . carers have to cope with a number of problems in supporting drug users in their families ( velleman et al . 1993 ) . primary care staff can provide effective help to carers ( copello et al . 2000 ) . adfam is a national charity set up to support the families and friends of drug users . it provides a range of services including a telephone helpline , publications and training . families ' anonymous is a self - help network of group meetings offering support to families . box 2 scoda service users ' charter of rights and responsibilities a drug service user has both rights and responsibilities . the service provider has an obligation to make each of these explicit to the service user . a service user has the right to : assessment of individual need ( within a specified number of working days ) access to specialist services ( within a maximum waiting time ) , and the right of immediate access on release from prison full information about treatment options and informed involvement in making decisions concerning treatment an individual care plan and participation in the writing and reviewing of that care plan respect for privacy , dignity and confidentiality , and an explanation of any ( exceptional ) circumstances in which information will be divulged to others referral for a second opinion , in consultation with a gp , when referred to a consultant a written statement of service user 's rights the development of service user agreements , specifying clearly the type of service to be delivered and the expected quality standards the development of advocacy an effective complaints system information about self -

and - a - half of those years writing it . 2 . i think the history of olympic never finds an end for authors and historians . how long before the publication date was the book completed ? the book itself was delivered to my publisher in january 2004 , and then published eleven months later . i do n't think the process of research ends , as i will always be searching for new information . 3 . what is the ( in your opinion ) most exciting information about olympic you found ? it is hard to decide . i will list four points . i think that leonard peskett 's 1911 report about his voyage on the olympic , and cunard 's correspondence about the olympic in 1911 , were of great interest ; these documents show how cunard felt that they needed to respond to the white star line 's new ships , in the new aquitania . as you know , these are recorded in detail in the book . from a technical point of view , it was interesting to find that olympic 's engines could develop 59,000 horsepower , according to her chief engineer in 1911 , because most sources have a much lower figure . some sources seem to imply that olympic was only carrying an average of 200 passengers on each voyage in 1930 - 35 , but in fact her passenger listings show that she averaged more than 600 passengers in 1930 , and then over 430 passengers per voyage until 1933 . even in 1932 and 1933 , she was carrying over 1,000 passengers occasionally . while the olympic suffered from the depression , she did not suffer as badly as people often seem to have thought . it was interesting to find that it had been considered possible to use olympic as a floating hotel , in 1935 , because most people appear to have felt that the idea of a floating hotel did not arrive until the 1960s and the queen mary . 4 . is there a detail which you would gladly have published , but there was no time to integrate it before the printing ? yes , there are a number of details , although nothing that would change what i have already written , but rather details that would add to it . i would like to give one example : in the book , i wrote that i did not think it was correct that olympic was limited to 21 knots after 1932 . after the book was written i discovered a log extract from 1933 which showed that olympic achieved , for a day , an average speed through the water of 23.3 knots � an average speed over the ground of 22.8 knots , westbound . [ * ] this is one of several examples of how fast the olympic continued to be . 5 . have a look in your book ! there are many unknown photos in it . it has the appearance that one of your goals was to show the olympic from a side , which only a few have seen so far . that succeeded , i think . what reactions did you receive after the publication ? thank you . although it is � early days , ' as the book has been on sale since november [ 2004 ] , i have been pleased to receive a number of compliments on the book . it is pleasing that a number of people have been interested in the new information . i was pleased to be able to publish new photographs , and use my editor 's photographic collection in the book . 6 . would you say the olympic 's history is more interesting than the short histories of her ill - fated sister ships ? it is hard to say . personally , i think it is . there are many people who became interested in the titanic because of the disaster , and in a small way the same thing could be considered true with the britannic and the 1995 , 1997 , 1998 , 1999 and 2003 expeditions to the wreck , but the olympic is known for succeeding at what she was built for . she proved a very popular ship and was in service for a quarter of a century . it is unfortunate that this fame does not seem to be found outside ocean liner enthusiasts . 7 . are you an olympic collector ? did you use memorabilia for the book ? i do try and collect the occasional rare photograph , postcard or brochure of the olympic . unfortunately it is an expensive hobby ! i am lucky that my editor , campbell mccutcheon , has such a good collection , which helped make the book what it is . 8 . it is often said that titanic enthusiasts quickly discover their passion for olympic , so that the titanic recedes into the background . have you felt it ? i became interested in the titanic at a young age , and although i am still interested in the ship , the olympic has become my main interest , yes . 9 . have you ever met an olympic passenger ? if so , please tell us about that meeting . i have never met anyone who sailed on the olympic , although when i was writing the book i did try to find people � with the help of daniel klistorner � who had sailed on the ship . there was an 89-year old gentleman in southampton in 1998 � according to a newspaper � who had worked on the olympic , but i did not succeed in contacting him . i hope to correspond with a gentleman in america , through a mutual friend , who sailed on the olympic as a first class passenger , over the next few months . 10 . how and in which countries did you find the information for your book ? where did you search ? with the help of friends and researchers from around the world , who generously shared material and offered their opinions , information has come from many countries : from canada to australia , america to ireland , germany , greece and the united kingdom . i also visited and corresponded with many archives in the united kingdom , and especially canada for wartime memories of the olympic . 11 . i think you found friends all over the world within your search , because everywhere live olympic lovers . i 've certainly corresponded with people from all over the world , and sent books to a number of countries . it feels remarkable . thank you . 12 . is a revised version planned ? it would be nice to complete a second edition sometime in the future , but that would be a number of years ahead and we 'll have to see what happens . i am confident that there will be a reprint of the book soon , but there will not be any significant changes . 13 . what is your next project ? after my book projects that came to life in 2004 , i think i will have a bit of � breathing ' space . i have almost finished another book , but i do n't want to say what it is about publicly yet ._. _ _ bonn convention : aquatic warbler mou the aquatic warbler is a regular but rare autumn migrant , travelling from eastern europe to sub - saharan africa . it is dependent on specialised and vulnerable breeding habitat ( for example , marshes , fen mires ) which means that it has become globally threatened as this habitat has declined . the decline in habitat is due to human induced changes in the hydrological regime in key sites ( drainage and flooding ) , changes in land use and habitat fragmentation due to infrastructure building . pollution poses a further threat . the memorandum of understanding concerning conservation measures for the aquatic warbler was concluded in minsk , belarus , and came into effect in april 2003 . it reflects common concern over the dramatic decline of the aquatic warbler and aims to safeguard this species . the mou calls for cooperation among national authorities to promote the conservation of the species . it requires the strict protection of the species and the maintenance and restoration of its habitat . a detailed action plan is annexed to the mou , the aim of which is to maintain the aquatic warbler through its range and to promote the expansion of the breeding population to other suitable areas . this plan summarises the distribution , biology and conservation status of the aquatic warbler , and describes precise actions to be taken by relevant countries , including legislative measures , species and habitat protection measures , monitoring and research , and the establishment of a public awareness strategy . as of december 2004 10 range states had signed the mou . sub - categories uk implementation information resources the following resources are available for bonn convention : aquatic warbler mou the bonn convention secretariats webpages on the aquatic warbler mou . ' > the bonn convention website ( aquatic warbler ) hover over a link for more detail_nn _ _ the incidents which led to a third british soldier being executed for mutiny occurred almost a year after the blargies affair . the man , corporal robart jesse short , 24 northumberland fusiliers , was shot for his part in disturbances , which developed at etaples base in 1917 . the mutiny , which led to his execution , was initially sketched out by gill and dallas , who drew on the base commandant 's war diary and correspondence with some of those involved in the affair . written over two decades ago , their appreciation requires revision though it remains more reliable than the subsequent account by allison and fairley . the latter 's central claim , that private percy toplis , the " monocled mutineer " was the ringleader of the etaples mutiny might now be dismissed as a journalistic fantasy . papers released by the director of public prosecutions confirm percy toplis 's war service took him overseas , but nowhere near etaples base . the disturbances which are generally referred to as the etaples mutiny extended over a week and involved thousands of soldiers and began with the arrest of gunner a.j. healy , a new zealander from no.27 infantry base depot . he and others by- passed the police picquet ’s that patrolled the bridges that gave access to a small fishing village , which was out of bounds to troops . his son recalled : " it was the practice for those who wished to visit the township to walk across the estuary or river mouth at low tide , do their thing and return accordingly . however in my father 's case the tide came in , in the interval and to avoid being charged as a deserter , he returned across the bridge and was apprehended as a deserter and was apprehended by the ' red caps ' and placed in an adjoining cell or lock up . when news of this action reached the nz garrison , the troops left in a mass and proceeded to the lock up . " soldiers , probably waiting for the next performance at the nearby camp cinema , also witnessed the incident and " some feeling was shown against the police " . when those inside the cinema left the afternoon performance , the crowd around the police hut swelled until at 5.30 pm , a new zealander who had demanded the release of gunner healy , was allowed to inspect the cells in order to verify that the artilleryman had been released . simultaneously , the restive crowd threw stones and attempts were made to rush the building . one of the camp police , private harry reeve , wrenched a pistol from a soldier and fired at least a couple of rounds over the heads of the crowd before the weapon was snatched away . one shot hit a soldier who was standing on the fringe of the 3 - 4000 strong crowd . a head wound fatally injured corporal w.b. wood , 4 gordon highlanders , and a second bullet injured a french woman standing in the rue de huguet , etaples . thereafter , the police simply fled . the immediate response of the regular camp staff was to try and persuade the crowd to disperse and round up a mass of men who , taking advantage of absence of the police , had crossed the bridge into etaples . thus , at 6.15 pm , the camp adjutant , captain v.c. guinness witnessed a staff captain vainly haranguing the angry mass of soldiers from the parapet of the bridge . colonel f.j. nason , officer commanding reinforcements called out a 50-strong picquet of new zealand troops , armed with rifles and bayonets but without ammunition . second lieutenant randolph gray commanded them . he found the huge crowd milling around the police hut was " fairly quiet " but around a thousand men had gathered around the sevigne cafe in etaples town : " the maoris were making things pretty hot . we found several hundred with a big sprinkling of scotties clamouring outside a building in which they thought the policemen had sought shelter . some twenty english officers were guarding the door , and were being badly hustled . a colonel was trying in a wildly excited manner to calm the mob . i pushed my way in with the intention of telling him i could help with the maoris . he must have been blind with excitement because he raised his stick to strike me . a big husky maori rushed in and grabbed him , and bawled at him " you ... hit a new zealand officer , i ... will kill you ! " this brought the colonel to his senses a bit , and he told me to do what i could with our men . liquor had inflamed them , and as you know , the maori is an ugly customer when he gets a few in . but they have great respect for their officers , and when the scotties moved away after the colonel promised them full justice , our fellows followed . two redcaps who very foolishly showed themselves were badly hustled , but the excitement soon cooled down . " in the camp three further picquets were deployed , totalling around 220 officers and men from ibd nos . 18 , 19 and 25 . officers were recalled to their depots and a trio from each depot were sent to persuade the crowd at three arch bridge to disperse . not only did they fail to achieve their objective but men continued to swarm into the village . lieutenant charles miller , assisting a more senior officer , was ordered to take charge of a picket of fifty men guarding the iron bridge , recalled : " the only bright spot about it was that we did not carry ammunition . when we arrived at the bridge soldiers were passing across it in twos and threes so we threw the picket across and stopped further passage for a short time . but it did n't last for long - the mutineers ( if one can call them so ) were perfectly good tempered about it , but they meant to go into etaples and have a drink , so they merely assembled a body several times our strength , and then charged us roaring with laughter in a compact mass like a rugby scrum . the picket was brushed aside , many of us rolling down the embankment and thomas atkins went off to his drink . they did that several times till all who wanted to go into etaples had found their way there . the heroic picket then guarded an empty bridge till midnight and then marched back . " miss m.i. leard , the apm 's waac driver recalled the scene outside the women 's hostel : " a large number of men collected around our camp later on in the evening and made a great deal of noise and threatened to raid it if we did not come out ! during this time all of us , about five hundred altogether , were locked in the recreation hut with instructions to sing hymns , which we did with our tongues in our cheeks , but with just a little sprinkling of fear in our hearts . the waac officer and the red cross nurse attached to the camp went out and spoke to the men who eventually dispersed , after which we were allowed to stop singing and go to bed . " by 9.00 pm the town was reported clear and half an hour later the camp was quiet . aside from the bloodshed and ill - discipline , this disturbance was potentially very serious . it threatened to disrupt the routine functioning of the biggest and arguably the most important troop transit base in northern france . its huts and tents , aside from regular camp staff , could accommodate over 12000 reinforcements . the training camp areas at the northern extremity of the base , collectively known by the generic term " bullring " , staffed by reputedly sadistic instructors ( " canaries " ) provided weapons training and punitive " toughening up " programme for recently drafted reinforcements and men returning from convalescence or leave . the six hospitals treated thousands of sick and wounded men who survived the slaughter at the front . hundreds of thousands of men passed through the camp , some arriving and departing by road but most via the strategically vital railway that traversed the length of western side of the camp . the threat such disruption posed to an important nodal point on the bef 's lines of communication would also have threatened the supply reinforcements scheduled to participate in battle of menin road . in itself this was enough to prompt the arrival on 10 september of lieutenant general asser , the general officer commanding lines of communication and two staff officers . he ordered a board of enquiry to establish what had caused the outbreak , visited etaples and ordered major henderson , the officer commanding no . 25 infantry base depot to take charge of the town and impose control over exits from the base . a further picquet of two officers and 100 other ranks , from the lewis gun school at nearby le touquet , were ordered to patrol paris plage , where there was a seaside promenade and beach . officers , who were billeted separately from the depots they commanded , were ordered to remain in their depots from 5.30 pm-10.00 pm . these preparations anticipated that the men in the camp , incensed over the killing of wood , would again attempt to break out of the base in the direction of the town and possibly go on to paris plage . at 4 pm crowds of soldiers broke through major henderson 's picquets and were reported to have held noisy meetings in the town and were intending to resume their hunt for the police . there being no police in the town at 6.30 pm , a body of 200 - 300 men began to move northwards , away from the town and towards the detention camp where it was suspected their quarry might be located . they were intercepted en route by the brigadier a. graham thomson , the etaple base commandant ; major g.d. white , deputy assistant quartermaster general ; captain e.f. strachan , assistant provost marshal and major j. dugdale , the apm , lines of |communication ( who had arrived with lieutenant general asser ) . they appear to have been unaccompanied by any escort and the composition of the party ensured that all the key bef administrative and disciplinary branches were represented . they witnessed thomson address the crowd and persuade the men to return to their quarters . he successfully repeated the exercise with a crowd of 1,000 men who had gathered at brick bridge and they also dispersed . thomson was also successful around 8 p.m. , when he persuaded a smaller group of around 100 men who were trying to break into the field punishment that there were no camp police hidden there . the final incident of the day involved major cruickshank , rail transport officer , witnessing a crowd of 100 soldiers who were intent on breaking into etaples town station in their hunt to find policemen . however , they were also persuaded to abandon their efforts and return to camp . during the afternoon and evening a few cars had been damaged but the angry crowds of soldiers displayed no hostility towards the officers and the camp was quiet after 9 pm . on the morning of 11 september , henderson convened a meeting with the officers commanding the infantry base depots , where the reinforcements were quartered . the agenda has not been recorded but brigadier general william horwood , the provost marshal , who had arrived at etaples with colonel wroughton and major dugdale , was strongly urged to provide additional forces . the adjutant general , ghq agreed to provide 700 - 800 soldiers to quell the unrest but refused to authorise the use of cavalry . given that there were literally tens of thousands of troops in the camp , the reason for thomson 's request was not because the disruptions was supported by all the men at etaples base but evidently because he felt that picquets composed of men from the ibd ’s were ineffectual . this opinion was expressed in his report of events that occurred in the late afternoon : " about 4 p.m. men again broke through the picquets on the bridge , went through etaples , broke through the picquet on the river canche bridge , and went on to paris plage . none of the picquets made any determined effort to prevent these men . this mob of about 100 men were seen near paris plage about 5.30 p.m. by major cruickshank , r.t.o. , who spoke to them and brought them back to camp . en route they were joined by other men , and reached the camp some 300 strong , where they dispersed quietly . in the meantime the lewis gun school had turned out a picquet for paris plage , but in view of major cruickshank 's action the picquet was not required . " thomson 's criticism of the picquets was also echoed during the trial for mutiny of one of five men arrested later that night , corporal jesse robart short . captain e.f. wilkinson 1/8 west yorkshires , who had been commanding a picquet made up of men from his own regiment , canadians and manchester ’s on the most northerly of the bridges over the river canche . he recalled : " the picket was armed as regards 150 & the remainder were unarmed . at about 9.10 pm a lot of men , about 70 or 80 with notice boards torn away from the camps and waving flags which were handkerchiefs of all colours including red attached to sticks approached me . these men pushed through , the picket practically standing on one side ... officers who stood out were also pushed aside . the picquet was absolutely unreliable at that moment so i called the officers together & made them fall their men in by regts . i then addressed the picket & whilst doing so ... [ short ] ... came back from the crowd of men who had just broken through & told the men they were not to listen to men . ' what you want to do to the bugger is to put a stone round his neck & throw him into the river ' ... he told the men to fall out & join the mob who had just broken through . " a few minutes later wilkinson managed to arrest short and by 10 p.m. the town and camps were quiet . aside from the vandalism inferred by wilkinson and some attempts to damage motor vehicles , no other material damage was reported . however , one man was run over and injured when he allegedly lay in front of a moving car and others had been bruised in what lieutenant miller referred to as a , " pretty nasty rough house " . however , it might have been worse had the picquet been issued with ammunition for their firearms . miller recalled : " the third night i was aghast to hear that the picket was to take ball ammunition . the officer commanding the picket then asked for an interview with the colonel commanding the base depot , and suggested that he ( the colonel ) should address the picket , in order to be sure that there was not a tendency on the part of the men to sympathise with the mutineers . the way the moth - eaten old fool did it was to parade us , and then order any man ' who did not wish to take part in picket duty on the bridge ' to step forward . after a little hesitation two men stepped forward and when the old man furiously demanded their reasons , it merely appeared that they had taken him quite literally , so they were put under arrest ... fortunately at the very last moment the order to take ball ammunition was cancelled . " on 12 september a more resolute effort was mounted to contain the disorderly troops . all reinforcements , when not undergoing training , were confined to camp . general asser arrived to witness the reorganisation and reinforcement of the counterforce and prepared , yet again , to try to break the pattern of unrest . captain longridge , apm arrived and replaced captain strachan , apm etaples , who departed for ghq troops . lieutenant colonel cooper of the honourable artillery company ( hac ) replaced major henderson , whose picquets had failed to contain the disorder . however , three hours before 366 men from the latter 's battalion arrived by road from montreuil , a thousand soldiers broke out of etaples base . the base commandant recording that the event occurred at about 3 pm , complained , " picquets once more failing to stop them . " the soldiers forced their way past the ineffectual picquets , and marched to paris plage before returning back to their camps . an anonymous officer later recalled the technique used by the men to breach the armed cordon : " the men picked for this duty grumbled quietly as we distributed ball ammunition , for these was much sympathy with the mutineers , though these now consisted of the riff - raff of the camp ... the guard for the bridge that carried the main road to le touquet was put under the command of a major . the other guard , a small one for the railway bridge over the river was put under ... a young officer from the border regiment . with bayonets fixed the two guards were marched off ... the bridge over the railway was unguarded , so etaples was open to those who ignored the order that all leave was stopped , and a number of men had left the camp . when this crowd of rioters ... had pushed through etaples they reached the main road bridge in impetuous mood and swept along towards the guard . the major ordered his men into two ranks , with the front rank kneeling , with rifles loaded and bayonets at the ready and then walked out to remonstrate with the mob . the ringleaders pressed on arguing with him and pushing him back till the men had to put up their bayonets to avoid wounding him . the rioters pushed aside their rifles and went through the guard . " this foray was embarrassing for thomson because it came soon after he had assured the french authorities that the disturbances would immediately cease . though the men had committed no damage who had been engaged in the foray to paris plage and only few cars were reported to have been " interfered with " , the company - strength picquets were unequal to the task of halting the forays . during the following twenty - four hours a massive counterforce was assembled and officers from general headquarters personally supervised the annihilation of the disturbances . asser again reappeared on the scene during the morning and ordered captain longridge to take over apm responsibilities from strachan . all guards and picquets were placed under the command of major dugdale and all ammunition in the camps was collected and sent to ordnance . dugdale had to cope with two breakouts . the first , at some unspecified time in the afternoon , involved about 100 troops getting into etaples . the second occurred in the evening , after a party of 200 troops were blocked as they tried to force their way across three arch bridge . thwarted by a determined picquet of hac wielding entrenching tool handles that injured two reputed " ringleaders " , the men found an alternative route into the town . on 14 september the authorities mustered a massive counterforce . it was made up of 2,000 infantry , including the 1 royal welsh fusiliers and 22 manchester ’s , supplemented by 120 military foot police and three intelligence personnel . the military police took over guard and picqueting duties from the etaples force , who were transferred to other stations . a company of the hac controlled the streets of the town and a company of the royal welsh fusiliers mounted guard at the detention camp . in reserve were another company of the hac and 22 manchester ’s . the 9 cavalry brigade were alerted but the situation did not require the use of mounted picquets . the three remaining companies of 1 royal welsh fusiliers , including pte . w.r. thomas , were " stood to " from 5.00 pm onwards . thomas 's personal diary records : " we were detailed off to hold each corner of the training ground ... lewis gun teams and riflemen were mounted in strategic points around the parade ground and as the troops in transit came up from their various hutments around about the usual time in the morning 7.30 to 8.30 they were lectured to by the various ncos and or warrant officers in charge , i.e. instructors , the yellow band instructors in the big infantry base camp and they were told in no uncertain terms what would happen to them if there was any more funny business . we heard the w / o tell their sections that if they did not behave the line troops surrounding the base would fire on them when commanded to do so . this [ sic ] seem to cool everybody down and although we were there for four days nothing untoward happened after this . " the base commandant 's war diary recorded a final , abortive act of defiance by the men stationed at his base , " 50 - 60 men broke out of camp , but were arrested in etaples . " when general asser visited etaples the following day , it was all over . the men of the counterforce relaxed and went swimming while others patrolled the town which troops from the camp were free to visit . the pattern of unrest had been broken and the counterforce remained on hand for a further two days in case of any further trouble . there was none . this summary of the events that dislocated etaples base for a week is not as dramatic as the eyewitness account of events by sir philip christison or the lurid testimony of allison and fairley . however , it generally tallies with gill and dallas seminal account and affirms that the mutiny was neither the work of a group of conspirators nor a charismatic ringleader . yet it is possible to identify soldiers whom the army held to be ringleaders and derive further information about the mutineers from the relevant entries in the jag registers . though some later cases may have been delayed , possibly while injured defendants recovered , it is reasonable to assume that all men apprehended during the disturbances were tried within a week , i.e. by 22 september . of the grand total of 53 , 37 were british infantrymen , of whom 18 served with scots and two with irish battalions . of the colonial troops , most of whom were also infantrymen , 10 were canadians , one was an australian machine - gunner and one was a new zealander . the remaining four soldiers were from units without particular geographical affiliations and may well have been attached to the etaples base staff . analysed by division , they embraced half of bef , with the largest number ( 5 ) drawn from all brigades of 15 division , four from 9 division and three from 35 division . by this stage in the war , men 's battalions were not always a secure guide to ethnicity but the high proportion of men from scots units is understandable , given that corporal wood was gordon highlander . the extent to which conscripts may have participated in the disturbances can not be confirmed from either war diaries or jag records . many men were charged with several offences , the most common of which was breaking camp ( 19 ) , followed by drunkenness ( 11 ) ; conduct to the prejudice of good order ( 9 ) ; disobedience ( 6 ) ; desertion or absence ( 5 ) ; threatening behaviour / striking a superior ( 3 ) ; resisting arrest / escaping confinement ( 4 ) and a handful of other offences . only four men , pte ’s . macintosh ( scottish rifles ) ; pte j.f. davies ( 8 australian machine gun company ) and trooper g.h. flint ( canadian light horse ) including short , were charged with mutiny and sentenced to ten years ' penal servitude . the sentences passed on the remainder involved ten soldiers being jailed for up to a year 's imprisonment with hard labour ; 33 were sentenced to between seven and ninety days ' field punishment ( mostly no.1 ) and a few were either fined or demoted . as a guide to the gravity with which the authorities viewed the affair , the courts - martial verdicts need to be interpreted with care . for example , pte . carl oson , a canadian arrested and tried at the same time and by the same court - martial as short , pleaded guilty to breaking out of camp and being drunk . his offence was described thus : " [ oson ] came out of a house near the [ river ] bridge . he entered into an argument with some of the picquet and the officer in charge of the picquet noticed him and found him to be drunk . " whereas short was executed for similar behaviour , oson was punished with 6 months ' imprisonment with hard labour . nevertheless , the week 's disturbances may not be dismissed as a fitful drunken brawl . the initial confrontation between the camp police and the new zealanders was sparked off by healy 's arrest . the new zealanders did not feature in any trouble after the monday evening . in fact lieutenant gray 's diary makes it clear that three days after woods ' death , the new zealanders were annoyed because they were confined to camp due to continued disturbances by other reinforcements . nothing , according to gray , would induce the new zealanders to participate further . references in numerous accounts to australian soldiers taking part in these disturbances are simply wrong . the australians were moved from etaples to le havre in may 1917 and their ibd was occupied by canadian troops . the staff of the canadian ibd took no appreciable part in breaching the picquet lines and actually drafted men to block forays from the camp . however , canadian troops were involved in breaching the picquet lines , as the courts - martial registers confirm . later accounts , giving prominence to the role played by rebellious scottish troops in hounding the camp police may be accounted for by wood 's regimental affiliation . however , by 11 september , the avenging hunters ' zeal seems to have waned after they failed to discover any victims . the breaching of picquet lines thereafter seems to have been prompted by reinforcements ' boredom and a search for recreation after the day 's parades and training had ended . there is otherwise no plausible way of reconciling the absence of major confrontations occurring until the afternoon and explains why the tired soldiery returned to camp every night . in fact soldiers continued to attend evening parades and few were inclined to desert . from rolls called on the evening of 13 september , it was calculated that only 23 soldiers were absent from parade . nor was the violence either universal or indiscriminate . no confrontations were reported anywhere other than around etaples or the southwestern side of the base . skirmishes developed principally where picquets tried to prevent the free movement of men out of the camp , i.e. at the bridges that gave access to etaples or the northerly river canche bridge to paris plage . when the pickets judiciously allowed soldiers to pass through the cordon there was no fighting . at most a tacit understanding appears to have matured between picquets and the roving bands but nothing that could be regarded as active solidarity . for example , none of the picquets were reported to have defected and joined the forays to paris plage . however , had the camp police not been removed to le touquet and replaced by provost staff , there is little doubt they would have been battered or possibly killed by vengeful scots troops . nor was the base commandant 's bland insistence that hostility was directed solely against the camp police wholly correct . for example , captain guinness remembered stones being hurled at officers who worked at colonel nason 's office as they made their way back to their billets on 9 september . as for the detested canaries , whose brutal treatment of men in the bullring features in many soldiers ' accounts , there is nothing to suggest that reinforcements did anything other than carry on with their training routine throughout the week . who else was there who could be physically assaulted ? the women in the camp ? not according to driver leard . perhaps civilians ? except for the woman wounded by reeve , nobody else was injured , though french officials were clearly concerned that the disruption should cease . as for material damage , there is nothing in the very full records of the royal engineers to suggest that any large - scale damage was caused to camp buildings . stories about burning down or otherwise destroying the police hut at three arch bridge are thereby wholly unverified . damage to motor vehicles was mostly minor and may be accounted for as attempts to hijack vehicles for joyriding purposes . damage to civilian property , particularly the sevigne cafe , may have generated claims for compensation from their owners but there are otherwise absolutely no references to attacks on buildings in the town or nearby paris plage . in spite of rumours to the contrary , not attempt was made to interfere with trains that carried wounded men from the front . medical transportation continued uninterrupted . more surprisingly , perhaps , given the purported radicalism of the reinforcements , not attempt was made to stop drafts from the ibd ’s entraining for the front . but what of the great discrepancies in eyewitness recollections ? some contemporary references insist that the disturbances were minor , trivial affairs . numerous others depict bloody mayhem and slaughter . they may partially be reconciled by simply acknowledging that eyewitness accounts were informed by where the authors were , what they saw and what they did . their interpretation of events , often clouded by passing years , remained coloured by contemporary rumours they heard and subsequently chose to believe . for example , soldiers who bludgeoned their way through the picquet on three arch bridge on 9 september would have recalled events in a different way to vera brittain , who worked as a nurse in one of the camp hospitals during the fracas . aside from the troops ' anger at the callousness and brutality of the etaples police and desire to escape from the joyless reinforcement camps , little more may be invested in speculating about the politics that informed the men 's action at etaples . even the red flags may have simply signified that their bearers had pilfered them from a railway signal hut and the bunting could have been decorative frippery from a restaurant or canteen . by virtue of being the only soldier sentenced to death , short may be considered to have been the leading conspirator of four men subsequently charged with mutiny . yet on the basis of his trial he emerges as a scapegoat rather than a ringleader . a reinforcement , he defended himself on the day following his arrest , vainly apologising : " i had a drop too much to drink and did not know what i was doing or saying . i have been in the army for eight years and been in france for twenty - two months . i am a married man with two children and i am very sorry for what i have done . " general fowke , the adjutant general , relayed the witnesses’ testimonies at short ’s trial , presumably reflecting the findings of an earlier court of enquiry , to the commander in chief . haig noted : " the ag reported some disturbances had occurred at etaples due to some men of new drafts with revolutionary ideas who had produced red flags and refused to obey orders . the ringleaders have been arrested and others sent to their units at the front . " nor was haig 's interpretation of the political element that lay behind the mutiny significantly modified after order had been restored : " drafts there got out of hand due to having 50,000 new drafts there without sufficient officers to control them . some men with republican ideas got amongst them , raised red flags , and made a disturbance . i decided to carry out training in future at corps schools of which we have 17 for 20 corps . this will help to keep drafts away from dockers at the bases . these are said to be very republican . " the link with " republican " dockers is curious , for etaples was a small fishing port and the nearest major docks used by the british army were at boulogne . was this a connection concluded by captain f.d.h. joy of the intelligence corps in his report about the etaples mutiny ? if so , then it goes a good way towards explaining why hapless corporal jesse short 's sentence was confirmed by haig on 30 september and possibly why he was executed at boulogne ( as opposed to etaples ) on 4 october . james cullen , a post - war fascist , who had been a private in the argyll and sutherland highlanders at etaples , claimed a similar political association . cullen revealed : " i was approached by a prominent communist agitator , who asked me what part i would take in getting the troops to mutiny . there was a small council of action set up and we set about doing everything possible to get a general rising ... the councils of action , of which i was one , were giving instructions through under channels . the revolt lasted three days , at the end of which a truce was come to between the general officer commanding and the rebel troops . i was one who refused point blank to recognise the truce and carried on with a small band of irresponsibles . eventually we tried to rush the guard one night , but were repulsed . i was captured and made a prisoner . " the five days of disruption at etaples base were no echoes of bolshevism but haig 's scribbling and for that matter ; cullen 's yarn has a common thread - a fear of socialism contaminating the rank and file . cullen 's concoction was written a decade later and appears to have been inspired by contemporary communist agitation in the british army . haig was writing in the aftermath , successively , of the russian february revolution and the mutinies that fractured the french army in 1917 . since april , detailed reports of the disintegration of the czarist army had been filed from petrograd and haig had learned of the french army 's bloody suppression of the revolt of around 10,000 russian troops at la courtine barely a month before the etaples incident . however , what happened at etaples base was hardly of a similar order and less than fifty men were court - martialled for offences committed during and immediately after the disturbances . yet even though haig was an enthusiastic believer in executions as a prophylactic against indiscipline , his decision to confirm the sentence against short , who had a clean disciplinary record ( unlike lewis and braithwaite ) , was unprecedented . the scale and duration of events at etaples were greater than the mutiny at blargies north military prison , but both share the conventions of military collective bargaining , involving negotiation as well as confrontation . in fact it may be maintained that the disturbances at etaples arose from reeve 's precipitate action interrupting negotiations intended to secure healty 's release from custody . the use of firearms was much threatened but not used , other than by reeve . the disinclination of the mutineers ( even drunken ones ) to use firearms , at least prior to the withdrawal of ammunition to magazines , suggests a high degree of self - control . it also confirms that firearms were unnecessary for them to achieve their apparent objectives . the key to the mutineers ' power lay in their ability to mobilise a mass of reinforcements to capture policemen and cross bridges . the ritualistic battles on the bridges entailed little organisation and were probably undermined as much by the continuing turnover of reinforcements as by the authorities strategy of containment , involving the deployment of a large counterforce and intimidation . thereafter , all that was needed to coerce the mutineers was a large counterforce and the threat of being shot . the motives of the mutineers , where the may be deduced , were not shared by all the rank and file at etaples and had news of the disturbances gained wider circulation in the bef , there is little reason why troops in the trenches would have been moved to engage in active support for the mutineers . the latter may have been working class brothers in arms with a shared detestation of military police and the proverbially brutal camp training instructors . however , self - preservation suggests it is most unlikely they would have supported actions that would have jeopardised the supply of reinforcements , leave trains or the evacuation and treatment of the wounded . as far as any prospect of support at home was concerned , wartime censorship prevented news of the affair being aired further afield and only a couple of references featured in the wartime british press . however , the impact wrought by the mutineers at etaples was significantly greater than that achieved by the blargies mutineers and there are grounds for maintaining that the affair did wring a measure of accommodation from the authorities . for example , in spite of sanctioning the use of live ammunition , physical coercion and exemplary punishments , the camp commandant and senior staff officers had engaged in negotiations to persuade troops to return to camp on 10 september , the original camp police were replaced and on 15 september restrictions on access to etaples were lifted . these concessions amounted to a measure of recognition of the legitimate nature of the mutineers ' grievances . it might also be argued that the mutineers ' determination exposed thomson 's inability to control the situation to such an extent that a minor disturbance in october ensured his removal as commandant of etaples base . however , his removal and the wholesale dispersal of infantry to corps training centres by 21 october were not the outcome of any demands recorded as having been made by the mutineers . for an example of wartime collective bargaining that created a greater impact than the etaples mutiny it is necessary to examine the turbulence created by the egyptians and other non - europeans of the labour corps ._. _ _ < < vampires & vikings .. home .. useful > > elephant call centre if you do n't subscribe to nature science update , this is what you 've missed : a network of listening stations might help to census elusive forest elephants by recording their calls . with the body of a hippo , the beak of a turtle and the tusks of a walrus , the long -

how your firm can help initiatives - how your firm can help work placements the group for solicitors with disabilities has a lot of students members looking for both training contracts and work placements . work placements are an important way for students to gain experience within the work place and experience first hand what it is really like to work within a law firm . it is very important for law firms to realise the positive things students with disabilities can bring to their firm regardless of what their disability maybe . all law firms want to see evidence of work experience within the legal profession when students apply for a training contract but gaining a work placement is as competitive as gaining a training contract . many students are unable to obtain work placements as a result of rigid selection criteria and firms not taking into consideration their mitigating circumstances . as a result candidates fall at the first hurdle as when it comes to apply for a training contracts as they do not have the relevant work experience . every individual is affected differently by their disability , has different needs and career aspirations . on an application form the firm just see the title of the disability and often has no idea of how it affects the candidate if at all . time after time candidates have to explain their disability , how it affects them and justify why they are capable of doing the job they are applying for . your law firm can help our students members . the group for solicitors with disabilities has the following ideas but we would also welcome any ideas your firm may have . 1 ) students with disabilities could be offered interviews for work placements even though they might not quite meet the firm 's selection criteria . students then have the opportunity to show their commitment to the legal profession . the firm will be able to have any concerns answered and mitigating circumstances explained to show the candidate in a true light on a level playing field . the student will get a feeling for whether or not they would like a work placement with the firm as afterall it 's a two way process . 2 ) designated places on work placement programmes for students with disabilities . work placements are an excellent way to show the law firm these students are more than capable of making excellent solicitors without the law firm having to make a judgement based on a title of a disability and an application form which may not at first sight meet their selection criteria . students gains valuable experience of the legal profession which will help them to obtain a training contract at a later date . it shows the firm 's commitment to their equal opportunities policy and it 's positive about employing people with disabilities . 3 ) open days and seminars aimed at students with disabilities these give the firm an opportunity to meet a large cross section of candidates and see what adjustments would attract talented students with disabilities . in addition how they can improve their facilities for both prospective candidates and clients with disabilities . firms will have a much better awareness of different conditions , which will help them to review their selection processes to make them truly compatible with their equal opportunities policy . the firm will be shown in a positive light and as being proactive in its recruitment practices . 4 ) mentor scheme solicitors within the firm being on the end of the phone to offer moral support to students trying to gain a training contract and maybe allowing the students to shadow them for a few days . 5 ) student prizes or sponsorship to realize the true achievements of a student with a disability . the legal profession has a poor reputation when it comes to employing people with disabilities despite the latest legislation . these ideas are an excellent way to show that things are changing and firms are showing a positive attitude towards employing people with disabilities . firms who realise this will see the amazing way people live their lives and understand that everyone wants to be successful in their legal career regardless of their background . � the group for solicitors with disabilities , 2005 . terms & conditions_nnps _ _ the number of available online digital collections is growing all the time and with this comes the need to discover these collections , both by machine ( m2 m ) and by end - users . there is also a trend towards service - orientated architectures and a likely critical part of this will be service registries to assist with discovering services andtheir associated collections . ukoln and the jisc information environment services registry project ( iesr ) [ 1 ] organised a two - day workshop to look at some of the issues that are likely to be present in building a distributed approach . all presentations from the workshop are available on the ukoln web site [ 2 ] . presentations andy powell , ukoln , began proceedings by outlining the purpose of the workshop . the first day was an opportunity via a number of presentations for sharing knowledge of current approaches to service registries and was not limited to the uk . andy then went on to say that delegates would be required to be more active on day 2 by taking part in the planned breakout sessions considering the many issues with service registries that are distributed . it was hoped that future work could be agreed and potential partnerships and funding sources identified at the end of the workshop . the next session was a series of three short presentations from the iesr project . amanda hill , mimas gave an overview of the project , currently in its third phase and holding data on around 260 electronic resources contained within the jisc information environment . pete johnston , ukoln , then described the background and outline workings of the rslp collection description schema [ 3 ] which forms the basis of the iesr collection metadata . he then concluded his session by outlining the dublin core collection description application profile and the niso metasearch initiative . the final iesr presentation was given by ann apps , mimas , who spoke in more detail about how the iesr works . the metadata describes the resources and includes information on how to access them by various methods such as z39.50 , soap ( simple object access protocol ) , oai - pmh ( open archives initiative protocol for metadata harvesting ) , web / cgi and by location url . all iesr records are covered by creative commons licences and all resource providers have agreed to this as it effectively advertises their services in the registry . iesr records can be accessed at present via the web , z39.50 and oai - pmh . ann concluded her presentation by sharing some thoughts on some current issues identified by the project ( scope , scalability , manageability , data ownership , relationship with library portal products ) and a distributed service registry model . following a sumptuous lunch and the opportunity to network , jeremy frumkin , oregon state university , detailed what they were doing in creating the ockham digital library services registry ( dlsr ) [ 4 ] . the broad goals of the project were to create a registry for all possible digital library services and to enable m2 m digital library service resolving . the dlsr is distributed from the outset , having many nodes over the network and the approach was partly based on the dns with its hierarchical design and de - centralised administration . each node has a local copy of the complete registry and oai is used for propagating data across the network . similar to the iesr , the dlsr needs to be scalable , manageable , use existing standards and technologies and offers oai - pmh , z39.50 , sru / w ( search and retrieve url service / search and retrieve web service ) and web interfaces to its metadata . rob sanderson , university of liverpool , then gave an overview of the niso metasearch initiative , concentrating on one of three task groups , collection and service descriptions . the purpose for the group was defined as being " to enable the discovery of appropriate , remotely maintained content and a means of retrieving that content " , and the scope for the group was enabling the retrieval of items . the group have devised a draft collection description schema based on the dublin core collection description application profile and it provides a core set of collection description properties suitable for collection discovery ( rather than item discovery ) . service descriptions form the other element of the group 's work , and it has been decided to use the zeerex [ 5 ] schema for service information . rob concluded by commenting that the metasearch initiative does not consider service registries within their remit , tending rather to concentrate on recommending best practice . next up was thomas habing , university of illinois at urbana - champaign ( uiuc ) , who described the uiuc oai registry . the catalyst for the registry was an identified need for finding relevant repositories to harvest . the registry itself is not distributed but receives regular metadata feeds from distributed services . registry entries come from various existing registries , from use of oai protocol features of friends and provenance , from periodic searching of google web indexes and by manual addition . there was a desire to make the registry 's contents available m2 m and this is achieved via oai - pmh , an rss feed ( to notify changes in the registry ) and via an sru service for searching the registry . following a short break , wilbert kraan , cetis , presented some thoughts on service registries and e - learning , starting off by describing the content object repository discovery and registration / resolution architecture project ( cordra ) [ 6 ] that has developed a model of how to create local federations of repositories and has also built practical implementations of the model . wilbert then spoke about registries in the eframework , some lightweight solutions and finished by raising a number of open issues including relationships between national and local services with local and national registries respectively , authentication , authorisation and access control . matthew dovey , oxford university e - science centre , spoke about an evaluation of universal description discovery and integration ( uddi ) [ 7 ] for the uk e - science grid and began by giving an overview of uddi . following details of the evaluation , matthew concluded that uddi could be used to provide an infrastructure for uk e - science but that there also remained issues which it was hoped would be addressed by the next version of uddi . the last presentation was given by jeffrey young , oclc office of research , and introduced their work on wikid ( wiki data ) . wikid extends the wiki model to " .. support the creation and maintenance of structured data .. " . wikid thus could support such things as marc data and field level data editing and searching . jeffrey did a walkthrough of a normal wikipage creation and contrasted this with the creation of a wikid ' collection ' which also entailed the addition of a new xml schema . wikid supports a variety of protocols including oai - pmh , srw / u , openurl and rss . the eating theme returned during the evening with the workshop dinner which , with fantastic food and suitable lubrication , provided a good forum for discussing the day 's presentations , networking and generally chatting about issues as diverse as rock groups and z39.50 ! breakout groups and discussions after yet more food at the breakfast bar , the second day required a greater degree of delegate participation . three breakout groups were formed to consider what issues exist in creating a viable , globally distributed service registry . in case anyone thought that task was easy , delegates were also asked where possible to suggest appropriate solutions to the issues . feedback from the breakout sessions has been grouped together under three headings for the purposes of this report . as often happens , there are more questions raised than there are answers identified . usage issues the purpose and value of a distributed service registry is unclear , is there a cost benefit for creating a dsr ? who are the likely users and how will they want to use the registry ? to provide evidence of need , it was suggested that different user communities be asked what they want . it is likely that the different communities would require different approaches and standards so perhaps some form of minimum input standard could be devised which suits the needs of most . technical issues should the registry be service- or collection - driven ? perhaps co - locating service and collection descriptions should be avoided ? start with services , as services have associated collections ; but in terms of the dsr , what is a service ? how would the dsr be searched ? it may be better to avoid cloning the whole registry , there could be local registries as sub - sets of the global whole or there could be ' core ' metadata for sharing with extensions for specific user groups . how feasible will it be to agree a reference model ? there is also the matter of the appropriate record : there are likely to be multiple records describing the same resource ; which one should be used and where ? is there a role for ebxml ( electronic business using extensible markup language ) ? management issues intellectual property rights ( ipr ) of the metadata within the dsr are also an important issue : can the records be used ( or reused ) by system vendors ? what about access control to the records , will there be public and private elements of the records and will the same access control and ipr cover the whole record ? who sets up nodes in the dsr , who is responsible for updating records , and ultimately , who pays for it all ? how can organisations be motivated to keep entries up to date ? what should be done about ensuring consistency with regard to the quality of records ? conclusions where do we go from here ? i might have missed something , but to me , there did not seem an obvious way forward . certainly delegates agreed that the framework in which the dsr would sit will benefit from being clarified and use cases need to be investigated across digital libraries , escience , elearning , museums , etc .. development of an agreed reference model for service registries would also be an important task along with practical experimentation between projects / services such as ockham , iesr and escience . leona carpenter , jisc , summed up the workshop and commented that funding appeared to be the biggest issue . it was not clear what future activities would require funding or were covered in existing project budgets . there was support from delegates for collaborative ( cross domain / country ) funding and this is an area that ought to be explored further . references the iesr project web site : http://iesr.ac.uk/ workshop presentations : http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/dsr-workshop-2005/programme.html rslp collection description schema : http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/rslp/schema/ the ockham digital library service registry : http://www.ockham.org/ zeerex web site : http://explain.z3950.org/ cordra web site : http://cordra.lsal.cmu.edu/cordra/ uddi web site : http://www.uddi.org/ author details john gilby project manager m25 systems team london school of economics email : j.gilby@lse.ac.uk web site : http://www.m25lib.ac.uk/m25link/ return to top article title : " distributed services registry workshop " author : john gilby publication date : 30-october-2005 publication : ariadne issue 45 originating url : http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue45/dsr-rpt/intro.html copyright and citation information file last modified : friday , 28-oct-2005 13:53:28 bst ariadne is published every three months by ukoln . ukoln is funded by mla the museums , libraries and archives council , the joint information systems committee ( jisc ) of the higher education funding councils , as well as by project funding from the jisc and the european union . ukoln also receives support from the university of bath where it is based . material referred to on this page is copyright ariadne ( university of bath ) and original authors_nns _ _ managing flexibility - courses for managers and employees managing flexibility is cd - rom introducing flexibility for managers and supervisors , showing them how to implement flexible work and how to support their staff as they move to new ways of working . flexible conferencing - coming soon to a desktop near you ok , so there have been some " false dawns " . but the technology is here to make high quality integrated video , audio and web conferencing a reality from every desktop . do computers have to look so ugly ?

flexibility and flexible work are terms used to describe a wide range of work styles and employment practices . broadly speaking , they are used to describe all kinds of employment which differ from the traditional 9 - 5 full time job with a permanent contract . the " flexible " aspect of these type of jobs can in different instances relate more to the employees , or to the employer , or to both . that is , from the employees point of view , flexible work may allow more freedom to organise their employment to fit in with other parts of their life . for an employer , the flexibility may come with the ability to organise labour resources more in line with the varying needs of customers , or with peaks and troughs of demand . in this section in this section we explore the various kinds of flexible work - as outlined in the table below . we examine also : the trends in the uptake of flexible work the impact on the workplace the technologies used how to plan for flexible work . use the links in the navigation bar on the left to find articles in each of the flexible work categories . types of flexible work flexible location flexible location includes : working on the move working from home working from telecentres / satellite offices variously described as location independent working , teleworking , telecommuting , home working , remote working , anywhere / anytime working . and many more flexible time the most commonly found forms of non - standard or flexible hours arrangements are :_: _ _ your child will learn about islam by playing lots of exciting games , full of colourful animations and cute sounds effects . six different games to choose from , with lots of levels - each time they play its different - lots of fun ! the games revolve around an islamic database of over 1000 questions - each with audio , and lots of images . three separate age groups supported : 5 - 7 years , 8 - 10 years and 11 and over - each with its own database of questions . makes a great gift . it will keep the whole family entertained for years to come ! no complicated installation procedures - just insert cd into drive , it autoruns from cd , there is no installation ! min . requirements : windows 95 , 16mb ram , cdrom drive , sound card . price : only � 19.95 some screen shots showing the games tree hop help the cat retrieve its ball . two bunny race two player game - which bunny will cross the finish line first ?

" ._. _ _ uk artists ' creativity rewarded british artists will receive well - deserved reward for their creativity through the introduction of regulations giving them the right to a royalty on the resale of their works , minister for science and innovation lord sainsbury said today . from today , when an artist 's work is resold on the uk art market for the equivalent of e1,000 or more , he or she will receive a royalty of up to four per cent of the sale price . lord sainsbury said : " the artist 's resale right regulations ensure a just reward for living british artists ' creativity while protecting the valuable uk art market . " the regulations have been introduced to comply with the eu artist 's resale right directive . " the balanced government approach will benefit struggling artists without placing a heavy administrative burden on the art market and will minimise the risk that sales would be driven offshore . " the directive required the government to set the threshold at which the royalty is paid at between e0 and e3,000 . eighty - eight per cent of works by living artists sold in the uk in the e1,000 to e3,000 price range in 2003 - 2004 were by british artists . to protect the most valuable sector of the uk art market , which is works by deceased artists , the uk government successfully negotiated a delay in the application of the royalty to works by deceased artists until 2010 , with a possible extension to 2012 , and will seek to extend it indefinitely ._. _ _ news review the abeceder press review highlights stories from around the world . send us your news if you would like to send us a new item , please complete our online form . page : 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 | 41 | 42 | 43 | 44 | 45 | 46 | 47 | 48 | 49 | 50 | 51 | 52 | 53 | 54 | 55 | 56 | 57 | 58 | 59 | 60 | 61 | 62 | 63 | 64 | 65 | 66 | 67 | 68 | 69 | 70 | 71 | 72 | 73 | 74 | 75 | 76 | 77 | 78 | 79 | 80 | 81 | 82 | 83 | 84 | 85 | 86 | 87 | 88 | 89 | 90 | 91 | 92 | 93 | 94 | 95 | 96 | 97 | 98 | 99 | 100 | 101 | 102 | 103 | 104 | 105 | 106 | 107 | 108 | 109 | 110 | 111 | 112 | 113 | 114 | 115 | 116 | 117 | 118 | 119 | 120 | 121 | 122 | 123 education is key to retirement planning - 20 - 11 - 2005 europe must ensure that people have access to financial education and information so they can make confident choices about their retirement said stephen timms , minister for pension reform at an eu presidency meeting in brussels . with at least three million people in the uk not saving enough it is crucial that financial education and information is available to help them plan for their future . ministers , social and pension partners from across the european union shared and discussed the steps they are taking to ensure people have the information they need to make decisions on retirement provision . stephen timms said : " europe is facing a huge challenge . across the eu over the next 25 years the working age population will fall by 7 % while the population aged 65 and over will rise by 51 % . we are living longer and have high expectations of our lifestyle in retirement . " we must help people plan actively for their retirement . financial education and information are important for setting realistic retirement expectations . we need to make sure that people are able to make choices which will help them realise these expectations . " we also need to support people on low incomes to decide how they can build up their pension entitlements . we are working with partners in the voluntary sector to ensure that we are reaching people approaching retirement . we are also working with the financial services authority and other partner organisations in its financial capability strategy , which will include schools and higher education , to ensure that young people are confident in decision making about financial planning and retirement . " the government 's informed choice programme for pensions - with the support of partners in the voluntary sector , pensions industry and employers - promotes access to the information people need to plan effectively for their retirement . department for work and pensions [ top ] colleges to focus on employment skills - 19 - 11 - 2005 a review of further education ( fe ) colleges which calls for a ' sharper focus to improve students ' employability ' has been welcomed by the government . the department for education and skills / learning and skills council commissioned report by sir andrew foster , the deputy chairman of the royal bank of canada , examines the key challenges and opportunities facing fe colleges . he calls for improvements in college leadership and for colleges to specialise in key vocational subjects , to improve prospects for young people and adults in the workforce . education and skills secretary ruth kelly said : " this report marks a once in a generation opportunity to reform and invest in our historically undervalued further education sector . i welcome sir andrew 's report and agree with him that colleges need a clearer purpose , improved leadership and a sharper focus on the specific needs of learners and business . to realise the potential that the report describes will allow colleges to achieve their rightful place as the engines of economic progress and social mobility . " fe colleges have a vital role to play in keeping young people engaged in education and training . they must also help the millions of adults without qualifications in literacy and numeracy , supporting them to gain the skills and qualifications for productive , sustainable employment and to keep progressing on as far as their talents and interests can take them . " " it is right that we prioritise college funding on these priority groups and ask those who can afford to pay to contribute more to the cost of their courses . for the increased investment in fe to continue we need better quality teaching and higher standards . there need to be tougher penalties for colleges which fail their students and a new approach to assisting students to complete their courses . we also strongly support sir andrew foster 's call that we continue to eradicate the unnecessary bureaucracy which will further release resources for the front line . we need to build a dynamic , responsive fe college network that meets the needs of employers , drives up productivity and improves the employment prospects of learners . " chris banks , chairman of the learning and skills council said : " sir andrew 's report is a useful contribution and clearly makes the crucial link between the fe sector and the ability of this nation to compete successfully in a global market . it articulates the need for higher quality provision , linked to innovative delivery for both employers and individuals . it endorses many of the aspirations of agenda for change and we look forward to providing a full response to sir andrew early in 2006 . " further education review [ top ] prosecution highlights safety issues - 19 - 11 - 2005 a serious injury to a young warehouse employee has prompted the health and safety executive ( hse ) to emphasise a number of important safety issues to employers in the warehousing and commercial storage sectors . these include supervision of inexperienced workers , planning work at height and ensuring safety procedures are maintained outside normal working hours . tristan arkless , a 22-year - old employee of iron mountain ( uk ) ltd , received a crushed vertebra and fractured pelvis after he fell 3.5 metres from a temporary platform erected between two racking units in a warehouse at the company 's premises in silvertown , london , on sunday 27 july 2003 . mr arkless and three temporary workers were attempting to remove archive boxes from the higher shelves in the warehouse , with no effective measures to prevent the fall . hse inspector john crookes , who investigated the incident , said : " this is an example of what can happen when work at height is not properly planned and when young , inexperienced workers are not supervised . it highlights the need for companies to make sure safety procedures are in place whenever their employees are at work , not just during normal hours . " the company should have made a proper risk assessment prior to commencing the job and provided a system of work incorporating a safe means of access , such as a tower scaffold , an order picker or cherry picker , together with appropriate training tailored to the use of the equipment chosen . at no stage should employees have been required to climb the racking itself . " the company should also have ensured that a competent supervisor was present on site , i.e. someone who could assess the risks and , unlike mr arkless and the temporary workers , recognise that working at a height of 3.5 metres on unsecured boards placed across an aisle between two racking units was unsafe and should not have been attempted . on wednesday 26 october 2005 , iron mountain ( uk ) ltd pleaded guilty to breaching section 2(1 ) and 3(1 ) of the health and safety at work etc act 1974 at the city of london magistrates ' court . the company was fined � 20,000 for each breach , the maximum penalty in a magistrates ' court . it was also ordered to pay � 5,000 to the victim and court costs of � 2,376.00 . health & safety executive [ top ] fined for breaching safety regulations - 19 - 11 - 2005 peterborough firm optima ( cambridge ) ltd was fined a total of � 8,000 and ordered to pay costs of � 13,151 at peterborough magistrates ' court on tuesday , november 8 , after being found guilty of three breaches of health and safety regulations . the firm , based at 62 park road , peterborough , had pleaded not guilty to all three charges during a prosecution brought by the health and safety executive ( hse ) . the case followed a hse investigation prompted by an anonymous complaint about construction work at a housing development outside the entrance to peterborough regional college in eastfield road , peterborough ( but not connected in any way with the college ) . a hse inspector visited the site on 11 november 2004 to investigate the complaint and found unsafe working at height with a significant risk of persons being injured . the inspector also observed the mobile access towers bridged by scaffold boards and unsecured ladder accesses . key health and safety documentation relating to the project was not displayed on site and could not be produced . appearing for trial on monday and tuesday , optima ( cambridge ) ltd denied breaching regulations 5(1 ) and 6(1 ) of the construction ( health , safety & welfare ) regulations 1996 , and regulation 16(1)(d ) of the construction ( design & management regulations ) 1994 . magistrates found the three charges proved beyond all reasonable doubt and convicted the company . speaking after the case , hse investigating inspector stephen hartley , said : " contractors are expected to organise and plan work at height effectively , and take appropriate measures to prevent people falling . where standards are poor hse will prosecute those responsible , even if there has been no injury as in this case . " health & safety executive [ top ] under age employment tackled - 19 - 11 - 2005 scores of officers moved into leeds city centre this week to tackle child exploitation and return those involved in underage employment to school . west yorkshire police 's local neighbourhood policing team were joined by officers from education leeds when they patrolled the city centre to make child employees and their employers aware of what children can and ca n't be employed to do . they were also reminded that breaking these laws could see them fined up to � 1000 or even handed a one - month prison sentence . alongside the child employment patrols , officers carried out their regular � truancy sweeps ' , which aims to return children to their schools if they do n't have a valid reason to be absent . parents found to be with their truant child , are quizzed over their child 's absence from school . these employment and truancy sweeps form part of a wider initiative to stop truancy and therefore reduce youth nuisance and juvenile crime . education leeds runs attendance competitions , bus and radio campaigns to drive home the benefits of taking an active part in the everyday life at school . sergeant steve guest who is leading the truancy sweep for west yorkshire police said : " our biggest concern is obviously the negative affect that poor education has on the child 's future but also the affect that it can have on their welfare . children failing to attend at school can be tempted into crime to relieve their boredom or may get into a difficult situation without anyone knowing their whereabouts . " the focus has to be on the parents to take responsibility and ensure your child arrives and stays at school . we are also focussing on those targeting children for employment and allowing them to work over the legal number of hours . " chris edwards , chief executive of education leeds , said : " we are delighted to be working with the police on this important initiative . this is an excellent way of making sure that families , employers , children and young people do n't just know the rules regarding employment and school attendance , but also the reasons behind them . " we want all our children and young people to be happy , healthy , safe and successful . children who rarely miss school are far more likely to achieve academically , have better self - esteem and be successful in later life . " we have made real progress over the last four years . as well as these patrols we run competitions , hold award ceremonies and advertise on buses and radio campaigns to remind young people that every single school day counts . " we think all our children and young people deserve the chance to spend every day in an inspiring place full of wonderful , talented people " . [ top ] psycholoical effects of positive thinking - 18 - 11 - 2005 the british psychological society have published a report about the psychological effects of positive thinking . whereas countless studies have examined the effect of negative psychological states on levels of cortisol - a corticosteroid hormone that is associated with stress and ill - health - few , if any , have looked at the effect of positive psychological states on the hormone , a fact that julian lai ( city university of hong kong ) and colleagues see as part western society 's disease - oriented view of health that " places disease and health on two opposite ends of a continuum and defines the two states as presence and absence of negative conditions , respectively " . in an effort to rectify this bias , lai 's team recruited 80 healthy adults , took saliva samples from them six times a day for two days ( for measuring cortisol levels ) , and asked them to complete questionnaires about their optimism / pessimism and their mood over the last month and the last day . they found that in men only , optimism was associated with lower cortisol levels after waking up , when levels of the hormone tend to peak as part of a daily cycle . the researchers said more research was needed to explain this gender difference . in men and women , they found that a generally positive mood during the last month was associated with lower cortisol levels over the whole day , even after controlling for good or bad mood on the day of testing . the researchers said their findings " may draw increased attention to the potential impact of positive psychological dispositions or conditions on cortisol secretion and thus initiate a shift of research focus to the physiological substrates of positive states of minds . " . future work should investigate whether the effects of positive psychological states on cortisol levels , as reported here , have actual health benefits , the researchers said . british psychological society [ top ] uk must lead the challenge against protectionism - 18 - 11 - 2005 trade and industry secretary alan johnson has pointed the way forward for the future of international trade , its challenges and opportunities for driving change . giving an inaugural address to an audience of invited guests at the university of hull 's newly - established , pioneering research centre , the wilberforce institute for the study of slavery and emancipation ( wise ) , mr johnson looked towards the challenges facing the forthcoming hong kong world trade talks saying : " today 's trade barriers run like a huge wall across the middle of the world with unprecedented change and prosperity on one side , and on the other a billion people living on less than a dollar a day . " mr johnson focused on the priorities , saying : " we must not force liberalisation on developing countries - we must leave it for them to decide the ' what , when and how ' of their market openings . but the challenge for those of us in the rich world who have already developed and grown our wealth is to cut subsidies , remove barriers , and commit to abolishing all first world industrial tariffs by 2010 . " this is an ambitious agenda , but big problems need big solutions . " the secretary of state was addressing academic and civic leaders , trade specialists and members of human rights and other key interest groups attending the event organised by wise , now a world - leading research centre for the study of slavery and emancipation that also provides a platform for exploring modern human rights issues . housed alongside wilberforce house , the home of abolitionist and former hull mp william wilberforce , wise will be central to hull 's forthcoming celebration of the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in 2007 . wise has a pioneering agenda that aims to highlight history and the need for change in the future . mr johnson 's speech reflected on this , and the power of exports to drive future development . he said : " it is sobering to consider that between 1776 and 1807 alone , it is estimated that britain traded over one million human lives and the overall total is likely to be many millions . more shockingly , there is still an invisible trade today , and wise is doing excellent work in highlighting this issue . " but poverty can also be a kind of slavery - one that should not exist in the 21st century . boosting africa 's share of world trade by one per cent could deliver seven times as much income as the whole continent currently gets in aid . if we halved trade barriers , we could raise the income of developing countries by 150 billion dollars a year . " with this in mind , the kind of deal i want to see in hong kong is one that sweeps away protectionism in the richest countries , but still shows compassion and flexibility in the poorest . " the 6th session of the wto takes place in hong kong from 14th - 17th december and will be attended by trade ministers from 148 member nations . wilberforce institute for the study of slavery and emancipation [ top ] repetitive strain injuries database - 18 - 11 - 2005 a new database expanding and updating existing information on important court judgments in repetitive strain injury ( rsi ) cases , will be of direct and immediate benefit to the health and safety executive ( hse ) who funded it , and to legal and health professionals working in the field rsi , trade unions , insurers and designers . the longer term aim is reducing the number of sufferers from this debilitating industrial injury . the work related upper limb disorder ( wruld ) database is free and can be accessed using the abeceder web link . it provides to members who register and provides details of judgments including the factors that courts considered important in reaching their decisions , the degree of care exercised by employers and the amount of damages awarded to claimants . it is estimated that in 2004/05 nearly 375,000 people in great britain suffered from a musculoskeletal disorder(msd ) mainly affecting the upper limbs or neck that was caused or made worse by their current or past work . many working days are lost across a wide range of occupations . john price , hse msd programme manager said : " hse is supporting this work as it can use this information to help write guidance , which can be interpreted correctly and consistently by employers , employees and the courts . this database is one of several tools that the hse can use to help evaluate the effectiveness of regulations and guidance . " the database will benefit all those with an interest in work - related rsi , including employers , trade unions , occupational health professionals , lawyers , expert witnesses in medicine and ergonomics , insurers , and people with rsi . repetitive strain injuries [ top ] pensions test for turner - 18 - 11 - 2005 as speculation mounts over the contents of the report of the turner commission on the future of pensions , the tuc has published a checklist against which it will judge the final report . tuc general secretary , brendan barber , said : ' no one lobby group can expect to get its whole submission accepted by the turner commission . nor should we get bogged down in arguments about detail where there may be more than one way forward . ' so we will judge the turner commission report on how well it matches our broad principles and objectives . that is why we are publishing the checklist we will use to gauge whether the report will move us in the right direction . ' but there is an even bigger test to be passed . and that is the one the commission will set the government . will ministers have the political will to make the radical changes necessary to solve the pensions crisis ? will they take the measures necessary to ensure that the millions of people in work today can look forward to a decent pensions when they retire ? ' the tuc turner tests : will the report ... have recommendations radical enough to deliver a new pensions settlement ? is it up to the job ? end the second - class treatment of women by the pensions system , and make the state pension universal ? make the poor , and those doing heavy stressful jobs , make an unfair contribution to a new pensions settlement by increasing the state pension age ? reduce means - testing in the pensions system by lifting the level of the state pension above the poverty line ? let pensioners share in growing prosperity by saying that the state pension should be linked to earnings once again ? support the role of the state in providing a pension above the basic state pension , particularly for the low paid without alternative arrangements ? recognise that a new pensions settlement needs a new tax settlement that will reduce tax breaks for the well off ? recognises that the only effective way to extend saving is to extend compulsion within the pensions system so that all employers face obligations to contribute to employee savings . trades union congress [ top ] gender pay gap narrowing - 17 - 11 - 2005 new office of national statistics ( ons ) data shows gender pay gaps narrowing , but gaps between public and private sector workers and high and low earners widening figures from the 2005 annual survey of hours and earnings ( ashe ) , published today by the office for national statistics , paint a mixed picture of shifts in the uk 's various pay gaps , according to john philpott , chief economist at the chartered institute of personnel and development . according to dr philpott , analysis of the figures shows there has been a welcome narrowing in the median gender pay gap for full time employees . but the median pay gap between the public and private sectors - which the cipd highlighted earlier this year - has widened as has the gap between the pay of the uk 's highest and lowest paid workers . dr philpott , arguing that employers and the government should draw lessons from the new figures , said : " despite good news on the gender pay gap , the latest ashe nonetheless shows that there is considerable scope for further progress toward genuine pay equality , particularly if one considers that relatively few women work full time and that women as a whole still tend to be concentrated in low - paid sectors of the economy . " while encouraging high reward for high performance , the widening gap between top earners and those struggling in the bottom reaches of the labour market highlights the need for much greater effort to improve the basic skills and earning power of less skilled workers . " and although everyone recognises the valuable contribution made by public sector workers , at a time of slower economic growth and rising public borrowing , the ashe figures indicate that the chancellor can now make a strong case for taking a tougher stance on public sector pay .

legend or lie ? picture the scene ... a moonless and yet clear night along a lonely country lane over the christmas holiday and not a soul stirring except for one local family returning home from an evening with relatives . picture again that lane as it sweeps down past the wooded enclosure of cranfield court ... hear the hushed whispers of the sleepy revellers ... and , what was the unexplained rattling of a five bar gate which increased their pace ? was it just a startled muntjac or , and heaven forbid , something more sinister ? whatever it was that disturbed their patter on that christmas night the response was unanimously voiced in two words , " lady snagge ! " when i first heard of lady snagge she was the subject of a story which was told to a group of us much quivering boy 's back in the misty 50 's by our scoutmaster . at the time the tale , which reeked of violence , decapitation and haunting around the lanes and bridle - ways of cranfield was regarded as a special story time treat and told in a hushed tone around the evening campfire . the tale tells of one lady snagge who was galloping along the wood end road to meet her lover ( i added ` lover ` to the script after my voice deepened ) when she fell victim to a group of thieves . the motley lot had stretched a cord across the lane at a place called wood end road at cranfield . the resulting decapitation was caused by the speed of her steed and her failure to spot the strop . unperturbed by their grisly result the thieves quickly robbed the body of its fine clothes , gold rings and brooches and , over the centuries , lady snagge`s ghost rode her powerful horse along the lane in search of her murderers . believe it ? well i did , but , there were questions to be answered and like all good ghost stories their is a fine line drawn between fact and fiction ... first of all - did the lady snagge exist at all ? the answer to this can be found in the church of st mary the virgin in the village of marston moreteyne . there , the intrepid ghost buster can see the red veined alabaster tomb monument to the memory of thomas snagge and his wife elizabeth . nothing too outstanding about this lady snagge except perhaps that her husband was a barrister , an elected member of parliament for bedfordshire , attorney general for ireland and finally the elected speaker to the house of commons in the late 16th century . there wasn`t much to read about elizabeth except she was the mother of five sons and two daughters and outlived her husband by some 43 years and possibly spent the last years of her life in cranfield . these facts come to light in thomas snagge`s last will and testimony of 1591 where it states ... " i bequeath also to my said wyfe during the saide term if she liveth so long , my conduitt and hoppe yarde ( conduit and hop yard ) in cranfield in the county of bedfordshire and my lane called venison lane in cranfield . " venison lane eh ? oh deer i wonder where venison lane could be ? so , lady elizabeth snagge was a cranfield girl when she died and would have been in her eighties so hardly party to some wild galloping along the wood end road to meet a lover . so , which of the snagge wives could the spectre be ? after the death of elizabeth there followed anne ( or anna ) whose husband thomas ( they were nearly all thomases ) died in 1675 . then there was dorothy whose husband died in 1687 and mary who married an edward snagge in the late 17th century . any one of these could have had lovers at brogborough park and set out on that ill - fated ride . mary street wrote in her book of cranfield that the ghost materialised along the wood end road where there used to be an avenue of trees running from the road that was known as lady snagge`s walk . lady snagge was said to ride along it on a headless horse and in the mid nineteenth century the rector exorcised the ghost with " bell , book , and candle " ... doris malsher suggested that lady snagge rode a powerful horse at dark , and was invisible but those affected by her presence could feel the swish of the animal as it galloped past and on to the round house at brogborough park . i don`t suppose that the modern thinker has time for the ways and wherefore of hauntings . nowadays folk are analysers and not easily spooked ... unlike terry bush and his unidentified mate who were cycling back to flitwick after some of newton blossomville`s finest ale ... " it was very late and we`d had a few and it was one of those clear moonless nights . we were at the bottom of marston hill when we suddenly ceased our chatter and accelerated our bikes to the junction of horsepool lane . there we stopped to catch our breath and both said simultaneously ... " did you see it too ? " at the bottom of the hill they had suddenly became aware of a figure moving towards them and up the hill . the figure was dressed in black with a white front and appeared to be without a head . on reflection and some thirty years later , terry , had several explanations for what they had seen . " it could have been a man with his coat over his head ` cos it was so cold that night , or a giant penguin and for a more realistic guess , a friesian cow ... we just spooked and accelerated away . " whatever it was that they saw , the legend will linger . lady snagge , for all her scariness , is part of the community of cranfield . peter hinson thank you to ... mr faulkner , churchwarden to st mary`s the virgin at marston moreteyne , for his warm reception and hospitality to the ` scruff ` with a digital camera and to bernice maynard , local historian , for her much detailed research and her astonishing ability to get to the roots and truths of it all ._. _ _ if the release you are looking for is not displayed below , please use the search facility provided . please note that up to 500 results may be returned . for more information about an individual release please call the contact displayed at the bottom of the release . for any other query please contact : � gnn west midlands � 5 , st philip 's place birmingham b3 2pw tel: � 0121 352 5500 fax: � 0121 352 5533 email : � birmingham@gnn.gsi.gov.uk � perform a detailed search for news from this area page 1 of 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 next last � west midlands companies gear up for success in automechanika small and medium -

at least tom was . clare squinted at the ferry terminal and frowned . the bags she had packed were heavy and stung her hands . the crossing had been noticeable for the sudden arrival of a cold wind . her legs still thought she was sailing and the cold made her feel light- headed . " where 's the taxi ? " she exclaimed . clare was organised and this was her last chance to land her biggest catch . she had arranged everything except the weather . clare loathed the snow and nature for its purity . she liked to be in control and now she felt powerless against the harsh reality of the environment . tom did n't hear her , he saw only the beauty of the bay around him . to him the snow was white , untouched and fanned by the wind into peaks on the beach . the scene represented an escape from the man - made bleakness of the city . this was how he wanted life to be , free , uncluttered and no deadlines ! " mmm did you say something petal ? i 'm sorry i was just looking around ... " his words trailed away to a whisper . headlights came into view and stopped close to them both . " you want a lift , not a good night to be out ? .. " clare fluttered her eyes and smiled at the driver . his complexion was rough like a withered apple yet his piercing blue eyes twinkled with life when he saw her legs . " tom , darling put the bags in the boot will you ? " she wined pitifully . he complied happy to see her smile . she smiled because he obeyed . the cottage was lit and warm when they entered . tom thanked the driver suggesting a dram in the pub as payment . he nodded and smiled as he drove away . clare was already looking around , getting used to her surroundings . " nice chap , i 'll buy him a dram or two tomorrow ... " he scanned the wooden beams and open fire surprised at clare 's lack of enthusiasm . he removed his coat and boots and warmed himself . meanwhile clare was unpacking her cases . she knew tom . he did n't surprise her and when she had first met him . she paid little or no attention until she found out he was rich . not seriously , obscenely rich but with the right connections to get her to those sort of people who were . tom was spellbound by her flattering but there was always something stopping him proposing but now . there were no distractions on an island she thought . she cooed at tom to come to the bedroom but , hearing no response , wandered into the main room . the flames flickered around the dark wooden panels and shadows danced about . tom lie asleep in an oversprung armchair . clare struck the chair with her foot but to no avail . irritated with herself for leaving him she retired to the main bedroom alone . the snow clouds cleared to reveal a clear velvet sky sparkling with a millions stars . the frost caressed the windowpanes , decorating them with patterns . a gentle breeze suddenly surrounded the outsiders croft , moaning a sad lament which gave clare bad dreams . it sang a different tune to tom - pleasant and wild and so , so sweet . tom awoke to find the fire was low and it cracked when he placed a dry log onto the ember 's centre . rubbing his hand on the glass , he strained to see what type of creature made such a noise . he saw nothing and the noise subsided . then he was outside the croft being drawn into the woods . he heard the machrie waters nearby but he could not stop . the moonlight painted blue shadows on the pines and frost decorated the branches . the beauty was stunning , yet tom knew that it was something more radiant that was pulling him . as he neared the clearing he heard the splashing of water and laughter . the sun rose reluctantly above the slope of the hill to cast a sleepy red - eyed gaze at the scene . clare woke early and showered and preened for maximum effect . it was christmas day and tom would ask her to marry him and she would pretend to be surprised . tom stared into the snow . had he been drinking the night before ? why were his buttons missing on his shirt and where was his shoes ? he vaguely remembered a feeling of total happiness and yet now it was gone . he remained sat on the porch for several minutes looking not for what , but hearing clare 's voice triggered him to return inside . " been out have you .. ? oh , never mind , i 've made coffee . " she held out a brown terracotta mug to his waiting hand , her eyes darting at him but not really seeing . " what time is it ? " asked tom , tapping his watch as it seemed to have stopped at midnight . then he remembered long soft red hair touching his face , but like camera shutter the image was gone . he stared hard at clare , and then kissed her hard full on the lips . for a moment she was speechless , lips warm and red , and yet she did not return the kiss with the same passion . a quick peck and she had escaped his embrace and was in the kitchen . tom remained confused for the remainder of christmas day and the presents and festivities proved to be somewhat of an anticlimax but passed well enough . clare settled down for a romantic evening . green eyes peered cautiously out of the darkness . " remember the farmer last night ? i thought we could go to the pub and buy him a drink . " he did n't wait for a reply . tom 's heart pounded quickly like a wild deer and yet he did n't know where the excitement came from . he just knew as instinct he should go . clare nodded in agreement . she dressed in haste and followed him as best she could , but her fashionable boots and clothes were for urban living and not thick snow . instead of trailing him her pace reduced in order to catch her breath . she regarded the figure in the distance . why did n't he look around ? green eyes saw tom enter the tavern and her wild heart raced . too long had she spent alone and apart from mortal men . usually they were regarded as interesting and cold as porridge , but this man ... abruptly she retired back into the pines as she heard steps getting louder . clare stumbled in the drifts where the snow - plough had failed to clear . she cursed him under her breath . the words were heard . suddenly an owl with yellow saucer - eyes and white ear tufts swooped silently towards a black fur hat . clare screamed , flaying her slender arms in wild circles to fend the owls talons off , but the hat was gone and in the snow lay a single feather . screeching with fury , she received no help . she was wet and dirty from the slush . angrily she walked back to the croft . she loathed nature and everything in it . the fur hat was dropped at his mistress 's feet , the owl landing on a branch bobbing its head from side to side . a trophy , a gift from a servant . it was approved of . the owl was rewarded with a plump dead mouse which it gobbled down hungrily save for the tail which refused to disappear . he closed his eyes satisfied . the pub was warm and welcoming - the landlord greeting tom like an old friend . it was a traditional pub decorated with hunting trophies and sepia photo 's , walls stained with decades of smokers . tom remarked at a small corner , heavily garlanded , lit by a single candle with a glass of whiskey standing in the middle . " it 's our altar to the lady of machrie - gives us good fortune . " replied the landlord in answer to toms unspoken question . " who ? " tom asked blankly . " let 's just say she is the reason we have the best harvests and the prettiest children and most beautiful girls . " a roar of approval echoed round . " how 's your wife laddie ? " asked the old man who had driven him . " oh she 's not my wife ! " the reply was quick and definite and startled tom . he did n't love clare . " aye , a bonny lass but with a heart of stone - you should be getting back before she gets angry with you ! " tom paid the landlord and set off back to the wooden croft . once again the sky was a velvet - blue . tom did n't really want to see clare . so , deliberately , he slowed his pace . he heard a rustling to his left and a hare came into view . " looking for food are you .. " oh god i must be drunker than i thought - i 'm talking to a rabbit ! " it 's a hare , " a calm voice replied behind him . spinning round quickly he slipped in the snow and knelt before a wondrous sight . the shape was a woman - definitely a woman . her black hood and cloak covered all of her body but cascades of red curls were unmistakable and when she lifted her hood back it revealed the green eyes and face of a rossetti painting - she smiled as he tried to speak . this was the vision he had met the night before , she had beckoned and he came willingly to her . she was the most beautiful creature with an air between dignity and sweetness and something which exceeded modest self - respect . tall , finely formed with a lofty neck and regular , yet somewhat uncommon , features , greenish blue eyes , large perfect eyelids , perfect complexion and a lavish wealth of red fiery hair . " i 'm sorry i stared but i thought you were .... " tom said . " a dream , " she finished . " if i am a dream , wouldst thou walk with me in the woods a while to keep me company ? " she whispered . " who are you ? " she placed a finger on his lips and the air was heady with the smell of violets and roses . tom did n't care about anything except the tide of passion which rose in his heart . if she was a witch or a spirit he knew he was totally in her power . the couple walked through the pine forest but left no trace in the snow . the lake glittered with a million reflections and she turned to face him . " will you walk with me tomorrow and the next day , thomas , when the moon is full , for your night is my day and has been so for a lifetime . " she lifted her hand and pointed to the middle of the lake . " this is my world and across the water is your world . " tom remembered the water , he remembered being pulled into the water and fighting and then embracing and kissing the woman before him . he felt no cold when he left her . the sun began to rise and the maiden 's face grew anxious for a reply . " hurry , my love , and make up your mind , my love is pure and free and willingly given to thee . at sunrise i must leave . " at this she threw herself in the deep water leaving no trace . he called but there was no response . the water was icy and the shock made tom gasp , but then she was with him in the shallows , helping him into deeper water . she kissed him hard and , holding her in his arms , they submerged in the waves . in the morning enquiries were made in the village , but clare was of the opinion she had made a mistake . she hired a small boat to take her to the mainland , leaving tom to enjoy the new year . the boat sailed out of the dock and clare did not look back . alison greensill ~ act of parliament the following is an actual act of parliament banning christmas . it was passed in 1652 during thomas cromwell 's time . refolved by the parliament , that the markets be kept to morrow , being the five and twentieth day of december ; and that the lord mayor , and sheriffs of london and middlefex , and the iustices of the peace for the city of london and weftminster and liberties thereof , do take care , that all such perfons as fhall open their shops on that day , be protected from wrong or violence , and the offenders be punifhed . refolved by the parliament , that no obfervations shall be had of the five and twentieth day of december , commonly called chriftmas - day ; nor any solemnity ufed or exercifed in churches upon that day upon that day in refpect thereof . ordered by parliament , that the lord mayor of the city of london and middlefex , and the iustices of the peace respectively be authorised within the late lines of communication , and weekly bills of morality . - hen : scobell , cleric . parliaments london , printed by john field , printer of england , 1652 . michael colmer ~ home for christmas christmas lights zigzagged from one side of the road to another . christmas shoppers hurried for the warmth of department stores , passing decorated , santa - filled windows . it was two days before christmas and the snow fell lightly over the path and road . it lay on roof tops , glistened on windows and street lamps . louise stopped and looked in a window longingly . a huge tree was displayed with presents round its trunk ; fairy lights blinked ; streamers dripped and baubles twinkled . a lump formed in her throat as she walked on . happy faced shoppers passed by with joyous children . a lady came towards her holding the hands of two little boys , their eyes wide with excitement and anticipation . they reminded louise of her own brothers , and the lump grew bigger . " ho , ho , ho , " boomed a voice beside her . turning she saw a jolly red santa mechanically waving its hand . she remembered last christmas , how she helped her mother in the kitchen preparing dinner . the stuffed basted turkey , roasted in the oven . louise could not remember the last time she had had a hot meal . steven and shawn had played with an auto city driving the cars down the long circling roads , parking them at the petrol station and filling up . daniel sitting in the corner at his computer learning a new game and lee strumming on his guitar . tears spilled over as she remembered it with affection . across the street was a telephone box . she did not know what she was going to say after eight months . " hello , mum , it 's me , your long lost daughter , " or " hi , mum , merry christmas . can i come home , please ? " lee answered and she quickly put the phone down . lee , one year younger at fifteen , no , sixteen now . they had both had a birthday while she was away . her friend simon had lit a candle and sang happy birthday to her . for a second she smiled at the memory . it was their only light , and he had blown it out to re - light for her . louise looked at the telephone again and somewhere heard , oh little town of bethlehem , and once again thought of lee . he had been in the school nativity when he was seven playing a reluctant angel . she did not want to talk to lee . she remembered his constant teasing and how the final straw had come when he found her diary and had told his friends her secrets . picking up the phone again , she dialled . it was her last coin . the sound of her mother 's voice brought fresh tears and a longing she had never known . " louise ! " her mother gasped . " oh louise ! ! " she sobbed . there was a commotion in the background . a commotion of voices that louise wanted to be part of . her dad came on and she could hear her mother crying in the background . she was trembling and it was not just from the cold . " where are you ? " he asked . " i 'm , i 'm , " she stuttered , trying desperately not to cry . " in london , dad , outside harrods . " " will you come home ? please come home , lulu , it 's christmas . " she could hear the break in his voice . " i want to come home , daddy , " she cried , feeling like a little girl again . " please come and get me ... " sitting in a doorway just near to harrods , louise snuggled into the worn winter coat the shelter had given her . she had come to london full of dreams and adventure . at euston station she had been befriended by a man who seemed genuinely concerned that she was alone . he fed her and gave her somewhere to sleep . but it turned sour when she realised what he wanted her to do for her keep . there were the men who wanted to touch her and the women who wanted to use her and the good samaritans who wanted to send her home . and then there was simon . she met him in an arcade . he was not much older than she was and , like her , a runaway . he had been on the streets longer . he showed her the best place to beg for money and how to steal the food they needed to eat . one day when the weather turned cold she had met up with him again at the soup kitchen . she was miserable and lonely . they stuck together after that and he took her to the shelter for warm clothes and blankets . when the snow began to fall they found an old house and squatted there . " my dad remarried , " he told her one night as they huddled together for warmth . " we did n't get on . she 'd pick on everything i did . she forgot it was my house before it was hers . when dad sided with her , i knew it was time to get out . " " did n't you have brothers or sisters ? " she asked , fascinated to be learning something about him at last . " two , a brother and a sister , four and six . they barely remembered mum , not like me . so when she came in the house and stripped everything of mum 's away , they did n't bother . but i bloody did , no one bothered to ask me . " " i 'm sorry . it must have been awful . " " yeah , well , " he said , turning round to snuggle further into her warmth . she felt sorry for simon , because she knew he was hurting . he pretended it did not matter , but she knew it did . early in december , when every morning was frosty , simon suggested they move to a shelter where they could have a bed . louise did not want to move on . she liked it in the squat . she liked listening to his stories , liked it being just them . she did not want to share him , or move away , but most of all she did not want to run into that man again . so simon left . he did not say he was leaving , he just never came back . as the days led up to christmas , louise shivered and begged alone . but as christmas approached she knew there was only one place she wanted to be . " louise ? " raising her head she saw two people , a man and a women . they held up cards to her which bore their photographs . we 're from the missing persons bureau and we 've come to take you home . alone in her bedroom , eight months and ten days after she left , she was back , sitting on the bed looking at her oasis posters and feeling happy . everybody had hugged her , even lee , who told her he was really sorry for what he did and never wanted her to run away again . christmas eve came and the snow was falling heavily . louise was sitting in the arm chair opposite the christmas tree which had lots of presents with her name on underneath . lee was having a bath . the boys were all watching peter pan . her mother was doing embroidery , but ever so often she would look up and smile . her father was , to all intents and purposes , reading the newspaper . but even his eyes would stray occassionally to her . the doorbell sounded and louise 's mother put down her cross stitch and as she passed louise 's chair she kissed the top of her head . " this is going to be the best christmas ever , " she whispered . " through here , " she heard her mother say as the lounge door opened again . everybody looked up at the unexpected visitor . carrying a beautifully wrapped parcel and wearing a shy smile , a clean and nicely dressed simon said , " happy christmas , louise . " it was going to be the best christmas ever ! k.j. mossman ~ ' fraoch leann ' ( heather ale ) heather ale , believed to have been drunk since around 2000 bc and reputed to be one of the oldest styles of ales in the world , is beginning to enjoy a renewed interest since the re - introduction of the long forgotten style and art of making the brew a few years ago , made from the flowering tips of wild purple heather boiled with scottish malts and wild myrtle leaves in order to extract the flavour and nectar , it has been described as being full and of firm character with a floral , peaty fruit aroma with a dry , wine - like taste . a history : 2000 bc ~ the isle of rhum ; a neolithic shard is discovered by archaeologists it contains traces of a fermented beverage made with heather flowers . 325 bc ~ pictland ; more commonly the lands north of the forth - clyde valley where the picts , who were accomplished brewers , brewed some awful grand drink they called heather ale from heather and some unknown kind of fog . 843 ad ~ scots and picts united under the scots king kenneth macalpine to form ' scotland ' or ' alba ' to the gaels . throughout medieval times many ceilidh stories mention the brewing and drinking of heather ale . this folklore includes the tale of a highland clan warming heather ale over the fire on a cold night . the steam from the hot ale cooled against the stone roof and dripped into a drinking cup . upon drinking the contents , the gaelic clansmen exclaimed ' uisge - beatha ' convinced they had experienced the fabled " water of life " . uisge had been discovered that night . this word has since been bastardised by the english language to ' whisky ' . 1707 ad ~ the act of union . after centuries of war scotland became part of the united kingdom of great britain , despite many wars of independence and highland uprisings , scotland had lost its freedom . many atrocities were passed through parliament during the 18th century , outlawed was the wearing of tartan , playing bagpipes and highland gatherings . lands were stolen from crofters , gaelic was forbidden and clans were persecuted - a whole culture and way of life was virtually destroyed . an act was passed which prevented brewers using any ingredients other than hops and malt . hops can not grow in scotland , indeed there is no gaelic word for hops , heather ale was all but reduced to legend . this persecution of the highland way of life caused thousands of scots to be transported to the new worlds of the west indies , australia , new zealand , canada , america and europe which led to a mass exodus of scottish society emigrating to follow their clans . 1809 ad ~ in the highlands and western isles the brewing of heather ale continued , as did the wearing of tartan and the gaelic language . they held on to their traditions and customs including the manufacture of illicit " uisge - beatha " the defiant message to the british government was ' pog mo thon ' ( kiss my arse ! ) . 1986ad ~ in glasgow 's home - brew shop a gaelic - speaking islander translated an old family recipe for " leann fraoich " to bruce william 's , the shop owner . he began the crusade to revive scotland 's brewing heritage by trying different varieties and quantities of heather flowers , making up batches and testing them on his customers . when the formula was perfected he began selling the brew as " fraoch " ( heather ale ) . 1992 ad ~ the first twenty thousand pints were produced at the small west highland brewery in argyll , sales were restricted to six pubs due to the capacity of the brewery . in 1993 , an agreement was reached with scotland 's oldest family brewers , maclay & co. at the thistle brewery in alloa which allows bruce william 's to brew larger quantities during the heather season ( july to september ) . every batch is inspected and recorded for the scottish brewing archive in glasgow . under supervision of the ' scottish office ' in edinburgh , the tradition and custom of brewing heather is protected and heather ale receives a " certificate of specific character " . robert louis stevenson wrote the following poem titled ' heather ale ' : from the bonny bells of heather , they brewed a drink long syne , was sweeter far than honey , was stronger far than wine , they brewed it and they drank it , and lay in blessed swound , for days and days together , in their dwellings underground , there rose a king in scotland , a fell man to his foes , he smote the picts in battle , he hunted them like roes , summer came in the country , red was the heather bell , but the manner of the brewing , was none alive to tell , the king rode and was angry , black was his brow and pale , to rule in a land of heather , and lack the heather ale , down by the shore he had them , and there on the giddy brink , " i will give thee life ye vermin , for the secret of the drink " , " life is dear to the aged , and honour a little thing , i would gladly sell the secret " , quoth the pict to the king , " and i dare not sell my honour , under the eye of my son " they took the son and bound him , and flung him far and strong and the sea swallowed his body , like that of a child of ten , and there on the cliff stood the father , last of the dwarfish men , " true was the word i told you , only my son i feared , for i doubt the sapling courage , that goes without the beard , but now in vain is the torture , fire shall not avail , here dies in my bosom , the secret of the heather ale ...... " james whyte ~ christmas office the office clock said 15:50 . it was christmas eve and bill was the last one left in the building . that was ok , he had nowhere to go ; nowhere he wanted to go anyway . " bah , humbug .. " he snarled to himself , but he was no scrooge . just after lunch he 'd called the staff together , handed out presents , wished them a very merry christmas , then sent them all home . by 13:30 they 'd gone , every one . so he 'd been sitting , staring at the picture of his late wife for the better part of three hours . perhaps he should just go home and drink himself into oblivion . ok , so he 'd feel even worse later , but there 'd be more booze , then a couple more laters , and then .. and then , thank god , it would n't be christmas anymore . yea , sounded good enough to him . three years since she 'd died ; that long ? how time flew when your soul was dead . well , obviously not quite dead , or times like christmas would lose the power to torment , prod him deep inside .. remember .. remember .. remember , stirring up the old joy that now lay inside him like toxic waste ! how could he not remember someone who 'd been his life , or the reason he lived it . now he was just a man turning off all lights because he dreaded the shadows so much . it was time to go home . slowly , he got to his feet , turned off the lights and shut the doors . finally in reception he opened the main door , snapped the last switch , and stepped outside . already it was dark and that was just fine . he reached into his pocket for his keys . " do n't lock it mr simpson . " he turned , startled . " oh , hello betty ! " " hello .. " she smiled , a little shyly . she was 38 , ten years younger than bill . she too had lost a spouse , but her loss was to a younger woman , or as it materialised later , a chorus line of younger women . bill had thought her attractive , tagging her husband mad , but he had to admit , since then betty had become almost plain , dowdy . he guessed it was a confidence thing . " did n't peggy tell you .. you know , not to bother tonight . you could leave it till after the holiday . " " that 's alright , mr simpson . really . i may as well get it over .. you know . " they stood there awkwardly ; two people with nothing to say , yet not wishing to appear rude . " well , whatever betty . have a nice christmas . " " you too mr simpson . " just as they were about to go their separate ways , they were stopped by a tinny , manic rendition of " we wish you a merry christmas " . betty turned back to see bill raising his hand to check his watch . it was flashing fitfully in a pathetic attempt to appear festive . bill looked at her , a wry almost embarrassed grin on his face , and tilted his wrist so she might see better . then he looked back down and gently touched the crystal . a chipmunk voice informed them that it was 7 o'clock on christmas eve , " ho , ho , ho , ho . " they had to smile then ; a chipmunk should never attempt a santa belly laugh . " wow , " said bill , " .. it 's never done that before . and i thought it was broken ! " " oh , i think it 's wonderful . " said betty , " what will they think of next ? " then immediately curled up inside at the inanity of the comment . oh , i bet that piece of razor observation really impressed him , she chided herself . " my wife bought it for me , " he informed her . " she reckoned i was gadget mad , so .. " he looked down , sighed , " .. so she went to the biggest jewellers she could find and asked for the biggest , singingest , dancingest , tell the time in the deepest , darkest , wristwatch available . " betty 's heart went out to him . he was obviously quoting . and he appeared so lost , so broken ; how she wanted to hug him , right there , right then ; tell him it was alright , everything was alright . the fact that she loved him- always had - was a side issue . " of course such a watch would not be held in stock .. , " he continued , " so they had to order it ... i received the letter informing her of its arrival about a week after she died . " her mouth formed a silent ooh , but she said nothing . " i almost did n't collect it . how could i ? i thought of getting someone else to pick it up for me . but that did n't seem right . it was already paid for , so i just phoned and told them i 'd be leaving the country for a while on business . they offered to post it to me , but i said no ; that did n't seem right either , and to be honest i was afraid of it being damaged or lost . anyway , about a month later , i just walked into that store and collected it as though it were nothing ; no , i told them , i 'm in a hurry , i 've no time to hear of its wonders ; then i just put it in my pocket and went home . " he laughed quietly , an essentially humourless sound . " brave , huh ? unfortunately , i could n't bring myself to open it for a further six months or so . " he raised his eyes to hers , " what a man ! " unconsciously , she 'd moved closer to him , now she reached out and touched his arm . " god , mr simpson , i can understand what you felt . really . but you must n't see love , or the loss of it , as some test of strength . i mean , you talk as though you were somehow weak , that you 'd let her down , when instead , what you have there .. " she indicated the watch , " .. is simply the most wonderful reminder of everything she meant to you , and you to her . it 's small , almost inconsequential , but it 's .. everything ! " when he looked at her the reflected street lights flared in the moistness in his eyes . " that 's right .. " he nodded quickly , bitterly " .. everything . i 'm an accountant , my life is numbers , so it seems that this love business is beyond my terms of reference ; one plus one equals one , take away one and you 're left with nothing ! just tell me what kind of bloody sense that makes ! " she bit her lip , but failed to still the trembling there . " i know . " her chin began to pucker and a sudden pressure of panic grew within her . in an effort to lessen the emotional intensity she heard herself say , " it 's christmas ! people are supposed to be happy at christmas ! " she turned away to hide her distress and the shame she felt at the stupidity of her comment . " christmas ! " he breathed , snarled . " do you remember that case a couple of years back ? you know , that old man found dead some months after christmas ? no one knew he was there you see . no relatives left , no friends to care about him , no counsellors , no no - one , nothing . so he sat down in his armchair and died , and not a living soul cared . when they eventually found him , it was because he was the source of a particularly foul smell ... so anyway , they broke down the door and there he was ... but do you know the best part ? the real icing on the cake part , that room was full of trimmings ! that poor , frail , unloved , surplus to requirements , little bastard had decorated his bloody room ! " for a moment he remained silent , and she knew he was replaying the scene in his head . " well , i have n't trimmed up .. have you ? " she shook her head , not trusting her voice , just wanting to cry . " it 's crazy , but for a long time after reading that story i could n't get him out of my head . i 'd keep seeing him , going about his task , ignoring his loneliness , finding the deccy box , digging out the tree , pulling out a chair to stand on , reaching up , almost overbalancing as he pushes in the pin .. jesus christ , i see him like i was standing in the room ! " his eyes were on her , wide , desperate , accusing . " why .. ! why , is that ? " she shrugged , what the hell did he want from her ? did n't he know he was talking to a shell ? if he put his ear to her head and listened there 'd be nothing but the sound of the sea . it was wrong of him to push her like this .. like she was a person ? she was surprised to feel anger swelling within her . " why what ? ! why did he decorate , or why does the fact that he did , upset you so much ? " she faced him , full on . he seemed startled , had almost taken a step back and yet her voice had remained level . but she was definitely taller , straighter . " firstly , because that so - called , sad little old man was better than us . despite all his losses he still had the guts to retain hope and faith , and had n't become cynical enough to sneer at happy memories as if they were just so many weaknesses . the second why is even easier : it 's not just any little old man you keep seeing , you 're looking into the future ; you 're seeing yourself some way down the line . do n't you get it at all ? you 're wallowing .. wallowing in self pity ! " quickly she touched his arm to placate him , aware suddenly how important it was that he should listen .. for both their sakes . " if you do n't believe me , then consider this : all pity is self pity . it has to be , otherwise we 'd hire help to feel for us , just like you hired me to clean for you . but if you 'd really felt for that old man , you 'd have been out there doing something about it .. no , not for him , too late for that , i know , but i doubt whether his kind suddenly became extinct with his passing . imagine , thank god he 's dead , now there are no more lonely , desperate people in the world ! " she sighed , but held him still . " that , mr simpson is bollocks ... so he 's still out there now , you know that , in his little room , smiling at the antics on the telly as he goes about his one way life , pinning his hope to the walls and ceiling . and you ? you who care so much that you 're haunted by his plight .. what do you do mr simpson ? " he tried to move away , to escape her eyes , but she 'd have none of it . both her hands now held his arms . " well ... ? ! come on , mr simpson , i answered you , now you answer me : what do you do ? ! unable to escape , not even sure if he wanted to , he looked hard into her eyes . " i ... i do nothing . " " that 's right , mr simpson . that 's exactly right . now , what type of pity do you call that ... ? " for quite a long time he failed to respond , but she saw the haunted look in his eyes dilate as though touched by anger . his answer was not what she had expected . " who the hell are you ? " she was surprised to hear herself laugh , but she liked the sound . she adopted a big macho voice , " do n't you mean , who the hell do you think you are ? ! " " i know what i mean ... betty is a shy little thing , kneecap high , invisible , would n't say boo to a goose . but you .. you ; tall , attractive , potentially beautiful , full on , tell it like it is , like it should be , oh , so wise , and ... a strange man in doorway accoster , to boot . " she smiled , easily . " i told you , it 's christmas . " he smiled back , but there was uncertainty there . " look betty .. " he dropped his eyes and seemed to swear under his breath , " .. i guess if something has n't got a number attached to it i 'm at a bit of a loss , but tell me .. is something happening here .. you know .. ! she shook her head and he thought how delicious she looked . " i honestly do n't know , mr simpson .. " the way she spoke his name was different too , coquettish , playing with him , " but i 'd like to think it might be .. " when are you going to call me bill ? " he asked . " just as soon as you call me kathy . " she replied with a twinkle in her eye . " betty left five years ago ; i was her replacement . " once again he had to swear under his breath . " sorry , kathy . " " s'ok , bill . " they locked eyes as though seeing each other for the first time , but mesmerised by their total lack of fear . kathy was the first to speak . " it 's not just because we 're lonely , is it bill ? " he smiled the kind of smile where the whole face joins in . " i 'm not alone , kathy .. are you ? " " no .. " suddenly he laughed and pointed to the street . she looked up at the snow beginning to fall . he laughed , " buggar me .. " he said , " .. it 's a wonderful life " " oh , i love that film ! " " hang on , " he said , diving into his pockets in a very exagerated manner , jimmy stewart fashion , " .. just looking for zuzu 's petals .. " she laughed at his foolishness . he 'd just reached into his breast pocket , when he stopped abruptly , and remained quite still . " bill .. ! " kathy moved to him . he looked terrible and was beginning to tremble . once more she felt panic in her chest , oh god , not now , please not now ! " bill .. please bill .. tell me ... ! " but he seemed to be regaining control . she watched him retrieve something , an envelope , from his pocket . he looked at it as though the key to the universe lay inside . he touched it , pressed it , his fingers dwelling , then tracing its contents . he reached out , took her hand in his and turned it palm upward . then he opened the envelope , it was n't sealed , and began to tip the contents into her palm . she saw it tumble , a metallic street light flash . she peered at it , turned it . was this a joke ? she raised quizzical eyes . " a battery .. ? " " a watch battery .. " he stated flatly . she tried to comprehend , reading his eyes for clues , saw them drop to his wrist . then suddenly it dawned , " oh , come on .. " she laughed nervously . " you ca n't mean ... " " i took it out a couple of days ago . i kept meaning to pick up a replacement .. but i never got round to it . " he removed the watch from his wrist stepped back into reception and snapped on the light . at the reception desk he prised the back off the watch with a pen - knife . kathy watched closely , expecting a trick , a joke , but no , she could see very well for herself , the watch lay open before her , and not a battery to be seen . " but it 's impossible .. " she observed pointlessly . " tell me about it . " answered bill . " what happened out there was an impossibility . " she shivered , but not with the cold . " and you asked out there if something had happened . " " we were going to part , kathy . you to your home , me to mine . ask yourself what stopped us , what forced us to stay awhile .. and talk . " " oh , my god ! " she could n't help herself , she had to cry . he approached her , comforted her , they comforted each other because he was crying too - how could he not . " what a wonderful , wonderful gift ! " she sobbed , " she was n't saying the time , she was telling us it is time . " " yes .. " he answered , " .. yes . that 's how i see it too . " just a little later , having found christmas together , they set off through the deepening snow to share it with the lonely ones . bruce blackmore ~ ' tis the pilot season los angeles - it 's that time of year . the time when tv shows are getting canceled and networks are on the look out for mid - season replacement shows . thus , pilot season is upon us . a few nights ago i was invited by a friend to go see the taping of a new sitcom pilot television show . the taping was at paramount and , given the fact that that is my favorite studio , i thought i 'd go check it out . i drove through the gates at night and there was a drive - on pass so i could park on the lot without having to walk through too much rain - the only weather we have to deal with here . the reason i like paramount so much is the ivy . it has nothing to do with the studio . it 's the ivy . it reminds me of brownstones back in chicago . it 's my version of wrigley field . there is this safe feeling that comes over you when you arrive on a lot . once enclosed behind those gates you know that you may experience a petty robbery but , unless confronted by a disgruntled armed guard , at least you wo n't be shot . they were shooting an episode from some disaster show with sirens and fire engines not far from the stage where the taping of the pilot was supposed to happen so i watched that for awhile . i walked up to the entrance of the stage where the pilot was being shot and there was a rotund , out - of - breath , miffed productions assistant at the door with a clip board . having been a production assistant myself i know his job and i know that he often has to take a lot of crap from people on and off the set . i tried to be accommodating . however , this kid was the kind of kid with a chip on his shoulder . the kind of kid who would n't and could n't give me a straight answer . he referred to his clipboard and told me that they were n't going to let people in for a while . i then walked back over to where they were shooting the disaster show and he looked at me in disbelief that i could walk away from the power of his clipboard . later , another woman showed up and she was insistent upon getting in . i stood next to her as she chewed out the production assistant yelling , " you seat us right this minute or i 'll have your head on a platter so fast it 'll make your seat spin " . nice graphic , i thought . he let us in . the crew was busy attending to the details of preparation for shooting the show . i noticed one lone painter still painting the set while the camera people were attempting to light it . i thought if this were a real comedy they would have left that guy in there . the seats were marked off with masking tape with various people 's names on them . in some cases whole aisles were marked off for some members of the cast or crew . my friend was the script supervisor , so my seat was in the next to the top aisle but in the middle . the middle is where everyone wanted to sit . i not only wanted to sit in the middle i wanted to sit on the end of the aisle in case i wanted to leave early . i get a little claustrophobic in groups like that . my friends parents arrived not long after and they were disappointed with their assigned seats next to me . they wanted to be closer to the front row . there were only about 10 rows of seats so it was not like we were in the bleachers but they insisted on moving . i noticed that the ushers , again with clipboards , were n't budging . this seating stuff was serious business . forget about the show , this was what was important . the hierarchy of the seating arrangements is what is important behind the making of a pilot . forget about all that stuff you may have heard about talent , writing , direction , it 's all about where you sit and whose name you 're sitting on . just below me there was a package taped to the seat . a tall , good looking actor came in and found the package was marked for him . he opened it , embarrassed , and found some caramel corn , some licorice and a card . he peeked at the card and quickly stuffed it into his leather coat . he was wearing black leather pants as well . another friend of his showed up and he tried to explain the package . he said , maybe this chick was trying to " sweeten him up " . he then offered the food to his friend . i wondered whether the chick knew her stuff would be going to someone else . he then proceeded to go into a litany of all the parts he was up for and how many he " almost got " . more people started to arrive . these were producer type people . you could tell by their attire and demeanor . unlike the funky dressed and quirky mannerisms of the actors ' section these folks were in their pearls and armani , with matching rainwear . they all greeted each other with the double " air kiss " . the kiss to both sides of the check which never actually makes contact . i think for fear of smudging one 's foundation or fear of some , as yet unknown , skin disease . they all had seats front and second row just to the left of center . they all huddled together supporting each other with their numbers . one or two of the women kept glancing over at the actor who was seated below me . they kept trying to get his eye but he was too busy relaying his latest " almosts " to pay any attention . he also kept getting more food throughout the taping from various ushers who were instructed to take him these care packages . at one point i leaned over and said , " are n't you mortified ? " he shook his head , " yes " . i told him i know a women who sent balloons to a guy in his office and he probably felt the same way . he agreed . there were two single women who showed up and sat behind me . they introduced themselves and started to compare resumes . one worked for a writer / producer developer of sitcoms at one of the networks . she explained that , while she was n't a writer , this would be a perfect job for a writer because there was plenty of free time in - between projects and if she were a writer - which she was not - she could be doing all sorts of things . she also mentioned that part of her job was to go around to various comedy clubs looking for talent . i turned around at that point to look at the person , the gatekeeper if you will , of the state of comedy today . i could n't help asking , " are you looking for just comics or are you also looking for comedic material ? " she looked at me and said , " huh ? " this person . this person who is not a writer . this person , this gate keeper with the key to so many people 's futures , who would n't know good comedy from a carpet sample . this person who laughed at all of the lame jokes by the warm up , wall eyed comedian , as well as all the lame retorts by the bused in audience , is deciding who will contribute to your entertainment on television . the other woman listened intently and explained that while she is just reading scripts for a producer she had the utmost respect for someone who knew how to spot a talent . having done stand - up comedy , i wondered whether this non - writer , who was biding her time in an office , bored out of her mind , was in any of my audiences taking notes . and whether or not she was laughing at the guy with the cigar jokes and thinking " yes , he 's potential sitcom material " . more producers started to arrive . one of whom , was an extremely ugly looking guy with a very beautiful , and probably paid for , woman . he was elbowing everyone he saw and pointing to her as if to say , " see , see , that 's mine " . most of the people he was elbowing were giving him the " thumbs up " sign and then turning around and rolling their eyes . a number of actors showed up . there was a couple in very expensive , distressed clothing . they probably paid mega bucks to look like most kids on the street , however , there 's that one difference , a subtle label here or there which says , " i 'm not trash , i just want to look like it " . they were seated near the center first aisle , but noticeably not in the dividing line next to the producers - or " above the line " folks . these are the executive producer , producer , director - the above the line on the budget folks . all others - technicians , camera people etc . are " below the line " folks , not to be associated with , nor socialized with , if one can help it . a woman with bozo - like red , ratted out hair , and some extremely bad plastic surgery , showed up with her daughter . she was making a stink about where she was being seated and insisted on being seated next to the funky actors . she immediately went into " schmooze mode " , introducing her embarrassed daughter to all the actors trying to further her career . i suddenly had real empathy for the maitre d 's in this town . if seating for a television pilot was this rough i could only imagine what it was like in some of the trendoid restaurants . the warm up , wall eyed comic stepped up to the plate and tried to get everyone into a laughing mood . they were n't buying it . they were still too busy jostling for seats and trying to prove that they were somebody to laugh at him or any of his jokes . and , finally , the bussed in audience arrived . these were the folks , some from out of town , who were just happy to be on a lot to see anything . they arrived to find the whole mid- section of the audience already seated with what looked like important people . they glared as they walked by , wet from standing in the rain , to be seated on the far ends of the audience , the worst seats . there were no refreshments for anyone . however , another example of the hierarchy was that , periodically , someone from the producer 's group would go backstage and come back with a plate full of food or a can of pop , just to further the distance between producer and peonery in the seats . everyone eyed the people who were bringing in the treats with envy . not so much for the food but for what it symbolized . power . the power to go behind the scenes and get something . anything . it did n't matter . peanuts . it was n't about the peanuts . power . just the fact that you were able to go behind the scenes and get something like peanuts , that the rest of the audience could n't , meant you were somebody to these power hungry folks . by the time the show started i was exhausted . the show before the show had been enough for me . it was supposed to be a comedy . and the comedy scout / gate - keeper , who knows a good laugh when she hears it , laughed at everything . i highly suspect she 's the kind of person who laughs at home by herself at reruns of " three 's company " . they taped a few of the first scenes and i was ready to go home . one man in the bused in crowd asked to be released . the wall eyed comic insisted that he had to guess his weight before he left . he refused and pushed his way to the exit . yes , it 's television pilot season in los angeles and not everyone wants a seat ._. _ _ johannes brahms was a master at crafting works at many different scales . his craftmanship is readily apparent in his chamber music for a small number of instruments , where he generally strove to ensure that the first movement of these works conformed to the accepted " sonata form " yet laying the foundation for a degree of novelty and experimentation in later movements which was true to the spirit of the romantic period . among his chamber music , brahms wrote two sonatas for cello and piano and this is the first movement of his first such cello sonata op.38 which is available in the following formats : scroch format -

screen love triangle . more ... luigi boccherini and his famous minuet : luigi boccherini was an italian - born composer who toured europe before settling in spain . he was a contemporary of haydn and wrote lots of works for string quartet and string quintet . his most famous piece of music is the minuet from his string quintet op.13 no.5 . here we have the original version and a number of alternative arrangements with all parts included . minuet for original string quintet minuet arranged for flute and piano minuet arranged for oboe and piano minuet arranged for clarinet in a and piano minuet arranged for soprano sax and piano minuet arranged for alto sax and piano minuet arranged for tenor sax and piano minuet arranged for violin and piano minuet arranged for viola and piano minuet arranged for cello and piano electronic classical music whichever way you look at it , the creation and processing of music by electronic methods is a huge industry which grew from small seeds sown more than 100 years ago . many engineers , musicians and composers have been caught up in the electronic music revolution which now permeates many aspects of different media and music genres . with his range of instruments from the moog modular to the minimoog , robert moog ( who died in 2005 ) was one of the key players in that fascinating and complex history . in this article we pay tribute to robert moog and those other pioneers who have helped to shape electronic music into what it is today . we have also included mp3 downloads of some of our own electronic classical music . more ... mozart 's eine kleine nachtmusik one of mozart 's most popular pieces of music is his " eine kleine nachtmusik " ( or " a little night music " ) , the more memorable title of his seranade no.13 for strings . even if you do n't normally listen to classical music , you have almost certainly heard this before on films or television . here is the first movement of eine kleine nachtmusik in its original form for string orchestra from which the score and individual parts can be printed . in additional here are arrangements of this first movement for various instruments : eine kleine nachtmusik 1 for flute and piano eine kleine nachtmusik 1 for oboe and piano eine kleine nachtmusik 1 for cor anglais and piano eine kleine nachtmusik 1 for clarinet in a and piano eine kleine nachtmusik 1 for clarinet in b -

known for some of his waltzes in his ballet music and other works , we 've chosen to provide no . 8 waltz as a sample . although much of tchaikovsky 's ballet music is very happy in mood , the composer suffered from bouts of depression and some of his shorter piano works seem to reflect that . here is his " sad song " or chanson triste . nicola benedetti : debut album nicola benedetti started violin lessons at the age of 5 and studied at the yehudi menuhin school for musically giftged children . in 2004 she won the title of " bbc young musician of the year " and also performed at the opening ceremony of the scottish parliament . just one year later , with the release of her first album at the age of only 17 , her meteoric rise is set to continue in 2005 . on this album called simply nicola benedetti she plays the szymanowski violin concerto no . 1 , which is the work which secured her win at the young musician award , and a number of other works for violin and orchestra by saint - sa � ns , chausson , massenet , brahms and tavener . more ... dvorak 's new world symphony czech composer antonin dvorak was well known for his use of music derived from the folk traditions of his home country and surrounding regions , such as his " slavonic dances " . for a few years , until homesickness overcame him , he held a post in the national conservatory of music at new work and there he discovered some new music traditions and composed some of his greatest works , among them his new world symphony . this contains a theme which is derived from the song " swing low , sweet chariot " , but is best known for the theme from the 2nd movement played on the cor anglais which seems to speak of his longing to be home in his native land . joseph haydn and his piano sonatas : joseph haydn is considered to be a key founder of the classical style of music . although he built on the work of others , his wide range of output was to influence many later composers especially mozart and beethoven . he composed many symphonies , string quartets and keyboard sonatas , all of which rely on the principles of " sonata form " . here is the first movement of his piano sonata no . 31 in a -

bass . we have arranged a number of pieces from the mfiles catalogue for recorder groups , with full score and parts in pdf format plus audio versions for download : minuet in f ( k2 ) by mozart arranged for recorder duet ( soprano plus alto ) and piano accompaniment minuet and trio in g ( k1 ) by mozart arranged for recorder duet ( soprano plus alto ) and piano accompaniment canon in d by pachelbel arranged for four recorders ( soprano , alto , tenor and bass ) rondeau by henry purcell arranged for four recorders ( soprano , alto , tenor and bass ) third mode melody by tallis arranged for four recorders ( soprano , alto , tenor and bass ) mozart 's piano concertos : among mozart 's great legacy of classical music are a total of 27 piano concertos . the slow movement of his piano concerto no . 21 in c may be familiar from its use on television and its regular inclusion in albums of classical favourites . this movement is often called " elvira madigan " because it was used on a swedish film of that name . this film and its music captured the public imagination and made the music even more famous . as a reminder of how this music goes , here it is in a variety of forms to play : online sheet music , a midi file and an mp3 file . partly because of its slow speed , it is relatively easy to play , so pianists might want to try out the piano solo part . for the conductor 's score and all other instrumental parts , please visit the online score page . classical composers poster the image on the left shows one of the most beautiful and informative products you will ever see . it illustrates more than 1500 years of musical development , through the classical music periods from " medieval " and " renaissance " , through " baroque " , " classical " and " romantic " to " 20th century " . the full size version of this poster is 40 x 27 inches and is printed on high -

" suggests that some apparent changes in the rate of mb 4 to 6 worldwide seismicity are real . the harvard cmt catalogue contains few large earthquakes for 1997 - 1998 , so it is likely that aftershocks are few . based on analysis of inter - event times , ray concluded that there were sufficiently fewer aftershocks in those years to perceptibly reduce the global seismicity rate . figures and text from his poster are posted at http://www.isc.ac.uk / documents / analysis / agu2000/ray/. aftershocks of harvard cmt events from ratios method [ frohlich & davis , 1986 ] . each event with p(tafter / tbefore ) < 0.99 is counted as 1-p aftershocks . analysis of seismic events from 1998 completed the isc has finished analysing events from 1998 . bulletin data were posted to the web as each month was completed . the printed bulletins and catalogues were available within several weeks of analysing the last data for each issue , while cds were produced within a month of completing the year . big catalogue for a quiescent year even in comparison with its relatively quiet predecessor , 1998 lacked great earthquakes and prolific aftershock sequences that can be especially challenging to sort out . nevertheless , continuing improvement in collecting data resulted in more than 98 % as many events as 1995 , which is the isc 's busiest year to date . with few great earthquakes of late and more small events , the average number of readings associated with each event is falling , from 23 per event in 1995 and 1996 , to 21 in 1997 , and 18 in 1998 . this still exceeds the 16 readings per event of 1993 , when the bulletin included many small japanese quakes . wider use of thresholds the continued growth in the number of events in the bulletin results from desirable improvements in monitoring and data exchange . but it also threatens the accuracy of analysis by isc seismologists , who must review an inexorably larger set of data each year . implicit thresholding has taken place for many years , as national agencies exclude small events from contributions to the isc . an explicit threshold was first used at the isc when events of 1994 were analysed . from then on , shallow m for earthquakes of 1998 , the isc excluded small events from more contributors , including bergen , helsinki , and jakarta . the full set of criteria is posted at http://www.isc.ac.uk/documents/1998thresholds.html use of thresholds frees the isc to encourage contribution of complete bulletins , allowing the centre to compile a more comprehensive database of global seismicity . at the same time , it helps isc seismologists to focus on the events where re - analysis has the most benefit . isc data comprise about 65,000 events annually since 1993 , and more than 985,000 in total since 1964 . new data contributions in recent years isc has received data of the philippine institute of volcanology and seismology only through neic . phivolcs resumed reporting both station readings and hypocentre solutions directly to the isc from 1998 . the hypocentres were introduced to the bulletin from september 1998 , which immediately improved completeness of the isc bulletin in the area and cut the number of new events " found " by the isc from unassociated readings . also in the year , new delhi and pretoria replaced their printed contributions with electronic versions , while jma added fault plane solutions to its electronic contributions . in each case , the isc had previously keyed only selected data , and is now able to re - publish more . the 1998 bulletin includes 111 events near philippines without a phivolcs hypocentre ; only 7 , all in the periphery , are from the last 4 months . catching up continues progress continued in correcting the publication delay that accumulated during 1997 - 1998 . thanks to a fully staffed team of three experienced editors , as well as several changes in processing , it took only 9 months to edit this year 's bulletin . dmitry storchak , isc 's senior seismologist , is confident of catching up analysis to the schedule during 2001 . new association algorithm pays off a new association algorithm was implemented from april that takes more account of the likelihood that a station will report readings for small , distant events . the new algorithm also adds consideration of later phase times and inconsistency between event magnitudes and phase amplitudes . in the past editors usually needed to manually re - associate readings for 30 % or more of the events each month . since implementing the new algorithm , automatic association has erred on only about two - thirds as many events . fraction of events with association manually changed during editing ._. _ _ the definitive map the definitive map records the location and status of all recorded public rights of way . a definitive statement goes with the map and gives the start and end points and sometimes decription of the route . definitive map duties in 1997 the borough of poole achieved ' unitary status ' which includes being the surveying authority for the borough . duties are to:- maintain the definitive map and statement investigate applications to modify the map and statement on user or document evidence continuously review the map by ' modification orders ' make the public aware of thier right to apply to modify the map . changes to the map the council also has powers to make creation , extinguishment or diversion orders of rights of way known as ' public path orders .

( 2 ) resources that have been scanned in . these consist principally of primary materials . scanning software tends to produce very imperfect results as far as text recognition is concerned . as the materials that i have scanned include numerous words in foreign languages , italicised and emboldened phrases , special characters , numbers , tables , etc . , and the quality of printing of the originals was frequently poor at the time , every document necessitates careful checking . however careful , i would be surprised if some errors escape detection . the files then usually needs to be converted to html so that they can be made available on a web server . this provides scope for additional errors . generally , however , my re - reading of the documents reveal very few errors of substance . experience with scanning , using specific software , alerts the user to the type of errors likely to occur frequently . it is important to note , however , that errors that you may detect in many of the documents available on this server , occur in the original materials . many were translated from the german immediately at the end of the second world war , to be used in the various tribunals that were established to try those accused of crimes against the peace , war crimes , and crimes against humanity . the volume of materials translated and made available in a very short space of time was very substantial . because of the pressure of time and other considerations , some of the translation is far from perfect , both semantically and syntactically . with very few exceptions , i have not changed any of the original materials . occasionally i have placed a comment in ( ) or [ ] , noted the correct spelling and added -editor , for purposes of clarification . the formatting of these documents was frequently imperfect , particularly with reference to indentation and paragraph / sub - paragraph numbering . i have not changed the numbering but have varied the indentation from the original when i thought that this would serve to clarify matters for the reader . for similar reasons to those referred to immediately above , german characters are not generally included in the original documents , presumably because typewriters being used did not have an umlaut and other accent characters . that is why f � hrer appears sometimes as fuehrer , g � ring as goering , and similar . this has also had the result that in some instances the same individual 's name is spelt differently . i have not strayed from the original versions . i have endeavoured to reference all documents so that readers can compare the web version with the original . ( 3 ) the third category of files available are those that i have written myself . responsibility for errors in all areas ( html , meaning , syntax , formatting , design and substance ) is mine . cross - referencing hypertext provides the opportunity to litter documents with hyperlinks . there is , however , a relationship between the number of hyperlinks per screen and the ability of the reader to comprehend the textual material . i have , therefore , exercised restraint in this respect . if a file is likely to be read sequentially , and it mentions something to which a link that will clarify matters might be included , i do not include the link on every occasion that the identical text occurs . on the other hand , if there is link to a particular place in a lengthy document , the same text may be linked to a number of times . of course , this is not rocket science . i have in some documents highlighted in yellow sections that could be hyperlinked to other documents on the server , but where i have not had the time to track these down prior to uploading . i have thought it more important to make the documents available as soon as possible , and only later add the hyperlinks . error reporting if there are any errors or hyperlinks to documents are not working ; please inform me . this is a large web presentation and errors do occur . some of the links to documents on other servers may not work because they are no longer active , or have moved . once again , the larger the number of documents and links that i make available , the more difficult it is for me to check these . referencing internet materials details document compiled by dr s d stein last update 20/10/05 17:31:08 stuart.stein@uwe.ac.uk � s d stein faculty of humanities , languages and social sciences home page_nnp _ _ why do so many people who give up smoking cigarettes , keep on smoking other people 's cigarettes ?

less nail knot as no nail , tube or needle is required to tie this knot , it can be tied beside the water . joining two lengths of leader material blood knot a good knot for joining lengths of nylon , for example when making up leaders . surgeon 's knot or water knot the surgeon 's knot or water knot is a good knot for joining lengths of nylon or leader material and can be used for attaching a tippet to the end of a leader . double grinner or uni knot this is an excellent knot for joining two lengths of nylon because the two halves of the knot are tightened independently . loops and loop - to - loop connection surgeon 's loop a very good knot for making a loop in the end of a length of nylon and is easy to tie . by tying a surgeon 's loop on the ends of two lengths of nylon , they can then be joined using a loop - to - loop connection . perfection loop the main benefit of this knot is that the loop formed lies directly in line with the main line . loop to loop connection also used to connect the looped - end of a leader to a braided loop attached permanently to the end of a fly line . tying on flies tucked half blood knot or improved clinch knot this is one of a number of knots to use to attach a fly to the end of the tippet . the final tuck makes it a much more secure knot than the basic half blood knot . turle knot this knot is probably better with bigger flies where there is more room between the hackle or dressing and the eye . palomar knot ranks alongside the trilene knot as the strongest knot for attaching a fly to a tippet . double turle knot this is an improved and more secure version of the simple turle knot . trilene knot this knot has the advantage that the tippet is passed twice through the eye of the hook which is known to improve dramatically the performance of most knots used to attach flies to tippets ._. _ _ airports are dynamic economic enterprises which are also sources of air pollution . the principle air pollutants emitted are oxides of nitrogen ( nox ) , carbon monoxide ( co ) , carbon dioxide ( co 2 ) , sulphur dioxide ( so 2 ) and non - methane hydrocarbons ( nmhf ) which are emitted from aircraft engines , heating plant , refuelling operations and vehicles associated with an airport . it has been estimated that worldwide , aviation contributes 1 - 2 % of nox in the lower atmosphere [ 1 ] . many of the above pollutants can impact upon local air quality and airport and aviation associated emissions of co 2 are considered to have a significant impact on climate change at a global level . emissions of certain gaseous pollutants at and around european airports are expected to increase in line with the predicted growth in air traffic movements . such changes need to be evaluated in the context of downward pressure on other emission sources and the tightening of air quality standards together with the legitimate expectations of the general public for a cleaner environment . over the last ten years or so many european airports have carried out air quality assessments . initially studies were driven by a need to meet legislation , or in relation to specific environmental concerns ( for example acid deposition in sweden ) much more typically , air quality studies have been carried out for planning and environmental impact assessment ( eia ) purposes such as heathrow terminal 5 , zurich , manchester airport . in order to review progress with air quality management the environment committee of aci ( airports council international ) europe surveyed member airports on environmental control practices . back to top air quality monitoring air quality is monitored for many reasons at airports including scientific , political , technical social and operational . a number of air quality monitoring strategies have been adopted by airport authorities involving the use of stationary and mobile monitoring facilities including continuous automated monitoring , passive methods such as diffusion tubes , long path measurements and particulate sampling . back to top air quality modelling dispersion modelling is a complex exercise which involves the consideration of many and varied emission sources . before modelling can be undertaken a robust understanding of all pollutant sources is required . the primary tool for understanding emissions and their geographical location is an emissions inventory . in simplistic terms , dispersion modelling takes the emissions data and combines it with meteorological data to provide a simulation of the concentration of pollutants over a given area . dispersion of pollutants can be modelled to give long - term ( e.g. annual period ) average concentration , or over a short term ( e.g. hourly ) to model episodic events . a number of dispersion models are available in the uk and europe . back to top future air quality at airports the adoption of more energy efficient practices and cleaner engine developments have resulted in a reduction in emissions per passenger km flown . the projected growth in air travel is , however , likely to mean that aviation will in the future account for a larger proportion of atmospheric pollutants than it does at present [ 2 ] .

upon release from their hatch , the lemmings carry on their way and will not stop walking , until they either hit an obstacle ( at which point they head back the way they came ) or they walk off a ledge and fall to their doom . to prevent this from happening , you must equip some of your lemmings with various abilities . these include blockers , which are stationery lemmings used to stop the rest from going any further in a certain direction , bashers , which dig tunnels in a straight line through obstacles , and diggers , who use pickaxes to dig diagonally down to the area below , to name but a few . however , in each level you are only provided with a limited number of these abilities , and so players need to think very carefully about where to place their blockers or how many lemmings of each type you might need to complete the tasks ahead . save the required amount of lemmings or more and you progress to the next level . lemmings is perfect for the psp , as loading times are short and allow for quick games that some other psp games have problems with . when you begin you are given sixteen levels , which allows even the worst player the chance to sample more than the first level , the rest becoming unlocked as you progress . my only real quibble with this game is one that could be personal to me , which concerns the controls . as a completely right - handed person , i find the game very difficult to control . i have always found , when this type of game is adapted to console , that controlling a cursor with my left hand is as comfortable as being painted red and introduced to a bull . however , in general , the controls are well adapted and accessible once you get used to them . one of the game 's main selling points is the level creator mode . this is a great feature that enables you to create the craziest or hardest level anyone has ever seen . with online capabilities , you can then upload your level to torture fellow lemmings lovers ! you can also download other people 's levels , thus increasing the longevity of the game almost limitlessly . however , the process of creating a level is very time - consuming and would be more suited to a pc feature . it is at times very difficult to see what you are building and ultimately difficult to create a coherent and , most importantly , playable level . this is still a great feature and , for those with the patience , a great opportunity to take the role of a designer . for myself , after my pitiful attempts , it actually made me appreciate just how much hard work went into creating the levels contained within the actual game itself ! if i was to have another problem with lemmings , it is that the homebrew version has been available for some time , and so sony really should have made this game more appealing to warrant the price . at full price it is really pushing the nostalgia level for what should be a budget title , despite the quality of the production and addictive nature of the game . the inclusion of more options or even a few photo or video packages of the lemmings from the past would have been a nice little extra . rather than attempt to create 3d lemmings , which has failed in the past , the designers have gone back to basics , which has brought more charm to the game . the lemmings themselves are designed well , with the correct balance between walking pixilated blobs and actual 3d characters . i would be lying if i said these are easily identifiable on the psp 's screen , but they serve their purpose and make the game pleasing to the eye . however , on the move things can be difficult to view at times . the levels in the game are visually stunning , with a range of background themes from familiar favourites to all new ones , filled with many visual surprises to keep you entertained as you go the sound is also basic , with familiar and new music throughout and these range from catchy to irritating themes . there is a feeling that the music goes along with the level ; if it is easy , the music seems boppy and playful , but when the game is difficult , the music almost sounds mocking in its tone . in - game sounds effects are limited , however , what 's here is all well chosen and the sound of lemmings digging is like that of someone munching cheerios . we still get the few lemmings sounds that we will all remember from the original , including the infamous " oh no ! " that accompanies the unfortunate nuking of the troops ! the level design is fantastic , with multiple problems and obstacles to overcome , often requiring the usage of real tactics and timing - once you 've figured out how the hell exactly you think you can get them to the exit safely , that is ! just when you think you have cracked it , say by digging a hole through the floor at a certain point , you realise that the ground below is too far away and all the lemmings impact with a splat ! this leads to levels being played over and over again until you solve them . some games of this nature can push you too far , to the point that it 's so irritating that you 've had enough . while lemmings can frustrate at times , it 's always with the promise of getting it right next time , and the addiction factor is so high that you can not help but have another try at saving those loveable but dimwitted little fellows ! lemmings really is a perfect psp game . one of the best puzzlers ever conceived has been given a new lease of life . unlike a lot of remakes , this game does not have a ' cheap cash - in ' feel to it , as it retains all the addictiveness and authenticity of the classic original . although the graphics are basic , this should not be seen as a negative , as simple is often better and , for a puzzle game , it looks great . as such , it really is a must have for on - the - go puzzle game fans and whether you 're a hardened lemmings veteran or have n't heard of it until now , it really is one of the finest games available on psp . with 156 levels available , plus infinitely more downloadable to play from other fans of the game , there 's enough to keep even the most skilled gamer playing until long after the lemmings come home . so what are you waiting for ? let 's go ! reviewed by david simpson for acegamez ( all rights reserved ) .

"_'' _ _ how do people earn a living in rural areas , now that only 4 % of the rural population work in agriculture ? a new report for the uk commission for rural communities ( a division of the countryside agency ) sets about exploding some of the myths and poses some challenges about the rural economy in the 21st century . the focus of the report , under the radar , is on home - based businesses which form a potentially dynamic but unsung cinderella sector creating wealth and employment in rural areas . the two key questions posed by the report are : why does the value of this sector go largely unrecognised by business support agencies and policy makers ? what should public authorities at every level do to respond and how can they maximise the potential ? homeworking more common in rural areas one of the particular strengths of this report is that it is strongly evidence - based . a huge amount of evidence has been marshalled from official and other sources , to present a convincing picture of the strength of the homeworking economy . amongst the data pulled together by the authors are the following : home - based working in the uk had risen to almost 3.3 million in the spring of 2004 , according to labour market trends . 766,000 people work from home in the 145 english rural districts ( the focus of the report ) this 11.6 % of the rural workforce working from home compares to 8 % of the urban workforce 56 % of self - employed people are home - based nationally , 39 % of small businesses are home - based . in rural areas it is 55 % 60 % of rural homeworkers are men , 40 % women the map above shows the distribution of rural districts with above average levels of homeworking . it is particularly strong in the south - west and parts of the north - east region - the more remote areas . in some communities in these areas over 20 % of the workforce may be running a home - based enterprise or two . what are home - based workers doing ? the nature of homeworking has changed radically over the course of the last century . most people who worked at home at the time of the 1901 census were women engaged in dressmaking and laundry work . there remains a minority of low - paid homeworking jobs . but over the past 15 years or so the availability of new technologies has transformed the nature of home - based work , not least in rural areas . this takes two forms : new economy jobs dependent on the new ict , where skilled professional or lower - skilled data processing is carried out from remote locations more traditional occupations can become more viable as business start - ups as the new technologies are used to overcome distance , so for example craft products can reach a far greater market , or customers can be enticed to come from afar . in around 50 % of cases , according to the report , home - based businesses are started up by incomers to rural areas , something that the authors feel should be encouraged and supported . many people are running more than one business enterprise , and many also combine part - time employment with self - employment . what is the impact of home based business in rural areas ? rural england has faced many challenges over the past 20 years . thousands of post offices , villages shops and pubs have closed , leaving many communities without local services . the growth of home - based working can help to recreate local economies , and revitalise dormitory towns and villages . the authors also point out the " sustainable communities impact " . potential benefits of home - based work include : use of one property not two ( i.e. for home and work ) less need to build new workspace to accommodate employment growth village and town centre renaissance reduction in commuting travel increased security - more homes occupied during the daytime an enhanced role for market towns providing ' hub ' facilities . so what should be done ? at the moment this growth in home - based enterprise is slipping " under the radar " . there is a plethora of agencies with fingers in the pie of rurality and economic development , but there is little evidence of anyone getting to grips with the issues . as the report says : " what is rare is any cross - theme thinking that sees the success of home - based business as being good for wealth creation as well as for the community and the environment . put simply , planning and economic development departments are not doing enough to connect the two issues together and work at supporting the new home - based working sector " . the business support agencies come under fire from many of the interviewees in the report , as well as from the authors . most of the support available is jargon - ridden , bureaucratic and is geared to growth and expansion models rather than sole entrepreneurs . networking models , however are held up as examples of good practice - where public money supports self - help networks and hubs where home - based workers can network and have access to facilities . the report has many suggestions for public policy responses : for central government , regional development agencies and local authorities as well as business links . the recommendations include : gathering evidence about local home - based businesses and their needs supporting networking and hub initiatives encourage the in - migration of high earners support mentoring initiatives simplify the processes of applying for funding . and above all , home - based business in rural areas needs to com onto the radar . further information under the radar - tracking and supporting rural home - based business , by tim dwelly , kath maguire and frances truscott , is available from the live / work network , price � 20 . www.liveworknet.com flexibility assessment : highly recommended reading for anyone involved in rural affairs , economic development and planning . � flexibility ltd , 2000 - 2006 if you wish to reproduce any content , please email the editor_nnp _ _ the socialist unity network originated in the socialist alliance . it is not a political group conceived to add to the competition between the many socialist organisations which already exist . it is a network of activists which campaigns for the widest practical collaboration of left groups and movements resisting the attacks of the blair government . in england the left has failed to make the break with the sectarian legacy that has dogged the ' far left ' for so long . such divisions undermine our ability to build a fightback against the blair government . the socialist unity network therefore believes that , in the interests of building resistance and striving to create the conditions in which a socialist alternative to new labour can emerge , it is necessary to strive to develop collaborative methods of working as widely as possible . this is similar to the process that led to the formation of the ssp in scotland , which was the result of a number of years of common work and discussion which enabled previously competing and sometimes hostile organisations to overcome old antagonisms and to develop greater political agreement . our supporters include members of political groups , such as respect , and others who are not members of a group . however , what unites us is the belief that we should strive for practical unity between the left groups in the interests of the working class and all those oppressed by capitalism . we campaign to do so in the local areas where we work and at the national level where we can . we are involved in the socialist green unity coalition which aims to prevent clashes between left organisations in the general election . the network operates as far as possible by consensus . where practical questions demand , we operate by majority decision , though we do not demand that network members adhere to a decision if they feel strongly opposed to it . we utilize the socialist unity network website as a source of information and discussion for the wider movement . we have an email discussion list which is probably one of the least conflictive you will find on the internet . if you would like to become a supporter of the network please email us . what does this entail ?
