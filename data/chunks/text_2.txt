" his utterances concerning us are bound to be weighty and well timed . " " he gives us an object - lesson which should be thoughtfully and profitably studied . " these well - considered and important verdicts were of a nature to restore public confidence , which had been disquieted by questionings as to whether so young a teacher would be qualified to take so large a class as 70,000,000 , distributed over so extensive a schoolhouse as america , and pull it through without assistance . i was even disquieted myself , although i am of a cold , calm temperament , and not easily disturbed . i feared for my country . and i was not wholly tranquilized by the verdicts rendered as above . it seemed to me that there was still room for doubt . in fact , in looking the ground over i became more disturbed than i was before . many worrying questions came up in my mind . two were prominent . where had the teacher gotten his equipment ? what was his method ? he had gotten his equipment in france . then as to his method ! i saw by his own intimations that he was an observer , and had a system that used by naturalists and other scientists . the naturalist collects many bugs and reptiles and butterflies and studies their ways a long time patiently . by this means he is presently able to group these creatures into families and subdivisions of families by nice shadings of differences observable in their characters . then he labels all those shaded bugs and things with nicely descriptive group names , and is now happy , for his great work is completed , and as a result he intimately knows every bug and shade of a bug there , inside and out . it may be true , but a person who was not a naturalist would feel safer about it if he had the opinion of the bug . i think it is a pleasant system , but subject to error . the observer of peoples has to be a classifier , a grouper , a deducer , a generalizer , a psychologizer ; and , first and last , a thinker . he has to be all these , and when he is at home , observing his own folk , he is often able to prove competency . but history has shown that when he is abroad observing unfamiliar peoples the chances are heavily against him . he is then a naturalist observing a bug , with no more than a naturalist 's chance of being able to tell the bug anything new about itself , and no more than a naturalist 's chance of being able to teach it any new ways which it will prefer to its own . to return to that first question . m. bourget , as teacher , would simply be france teaching america . it seemed to me that the outlook was dark-- almost egyptian , in fact . what would the new teacher , representing france , teach us ? railroading ? no . france knows nothing valuable about railroading . steamshipping ? no . france has no superiorities over us in that matter . steamboating ? no . french steamboating is still of fulton 's date--1809 . postal service ? no . france is a back number there . telegraphy ? no , we taught her that ourselves . journalism ? no . magazining ? no , that is our own specialty . government ? no ; liberty , equality , fraternity , nobility , democracy , adultery the system is too variegated for our climate . religion ? no , not variegated enough for our climate ._. _ _ foreign language lessons " the need for language learning does not stop with full - time education . as horizons continue to widen , adults need to extend , update or maintain existing language skills , and to acquire new languages in order to take advantage of new opportunities . the uk however is failing to develop fully the huge potential of language learning in adult life . " the nuffield languages inquiry , 2000 learning a foreign language is of great importance in today 's world , yet research has consistently pointed to a lack of foreign language skills in the uk . future success in the global economy , both at an individual and national level , is very much dependent on encouraging language learning at schools and in the workplace . why learn a foreign language ? learning a foreign language is a key element of cross cultural communication . it not only allows for dialogue in another 's tongue but also gives an insight into foreign cultures , promoting understanding and mutual respect . our extensive network of foreign language teachers allows us to offer you the chance to either learn a language or develop existing language skills . we offer lessons in any of the world 's major languages . lessons are always tailored to meet the client 's specific needs . we can focus the syllabus on general language tuition , industry and/or skill specific vocabulary or basic level conversation . lesson structure and content at kwintessential , we take a flexible approach to our work and ensure that considerable time and energy is invested into the creation of lessons which are tailored to meet the individual needs of clients . prior to course commencement , a kwintessential consultant will meet with the learner to help them identify their lesson objectives and clarify their needs ; focussing on their individual strengths and weaknesses with the language , if any . lessons are then developed using course books , industry / sector related materials and modern media such as radio programmes , newspapers and business journals . our language teachers kwintessential 's foreign language teaching staff are all established professionals with many years experience . the majority have both english and the target language as mother tongues . all are qualified and have excellent interpersonal and communication skills . due to the diverse backgrounds of our clients , strong cultural awareness and a demonstrated background of working across cultures is key . lesson delivery lessons are delivered on an individual or group basis . to ensure maximum benefit is gained from each lesson , it is important that groups do not exceed six students . cost of lessons lesson costs will vary according to language , level , numbers , time and place but our base rates are shown below : private tuition = � 30 p.h . a group of 2 = � 54 p.h a group of 3 = � 75 p.h a group of 4 � 6 = � 100 p.h . these are inclusive of the initial consultation , preparation and post lesson marking / assessments , but exclude vat and course books that the learner may need . we are also able to provide online language tuition . for a more detailed quote or for additional enquiries please contact us to further discuss your needs ._. _ _ thinking fresh thoughts marketing can , and does , take up books by the cartload . but i want to introduce you to a little concept that changed the way i think . the thought process transformed my business . and it can transform yours . the beauty of it is that it is deceptively simple to carry out . but first , let me tell you a story . a scaffolding company found itself struggling . there was simply not enough building work going on and they were in danger of going under . so the managing director sat down with his employees one day and asked , what else can we sell ? this is what they came up with . they could continue to hire out scaffolding to building contractors ; they could hire out scaffolding ' seating ' tiers to event organisers for sports events and theatrical performances ; they could take their skills - they were experts in the latest techniques of erecting scaffolding - and teach other businesses . in the end , the business turned on its head . it now makes more money teaching , particularly in third world countries , than it does from its other two services . stick to the knitting the trick when looking to branch out , is to remain true to your core skills and products - to stick to the knitting - to repackage what you already have for a different market . this process goes by the grand name of market segmentation . in essence , it 's about identifying subgroups in your market with common characteristics . in the case of the scaffolding company : builders , event organisers , and businesses wanting to learn new techniques . the simplest way to get the creative juices going is to create a grid . let 's imagine you are a cake shop making muffins . we have to take it as read that they are delicious . at the moment you sell muffins to people coming into your cake shop in ones and twos . but who else could you sell to ? and how ? delivery market single small boxes trays small crates large crates lorry loads take away from the shop eat in the shop - new tea room delicatessens in the area small shops in the area � 160,760 ( see below ) tea shops in the area local national trust tea rooms local businesses for meetings and business lunches local hotels local supermarkets national supermarkets export to all the above segments you will see how just creating such a grid will immediately expand your horizons . but that is just for the product ; you also have cake - making skills . delivery market one on one small groups large groups trade bodies the media export teach your cake making skills run evening classes write articles and recipes for magazines write the definitive book on the topic for one publisher for flour merchants as a consumer offer on the packet for a supermarket as a loss leader at the checkout part works for industry groups such as pubs a series in woman 's weekly the us and french editions get a slot on a tv cookery programme now there wo n't be a tick in every box , but you can see that you quickly create a new way of looking at your business . at this stage , the only limiting thing is you - because if you can imagine it , you can make it happen . which segment to go for ? some sections will seem more accessible than others . some have long lead times . some require gearing up . some will be more profitable than others . you want to tackle the segments that yield the best returns , which are most in line with the vision for your business . for example , you might not want to grow . you may be happier writing the book and remaining a small business . however , the marketing processes for the segments with long lead times need to start at the same time as the immediate - return boxes , so you may have two or three strategies rolling out simultaneously . there 's a simple formula to tell you which segments are likely to be most viable : the population of the segment x the percentage who buy already x the average sale in pounds x the average frequency x your expected share = your potential revenue for example , your research shows that there are 73 corner shops within a 50-mile radius of your premises . when you call them , you find that only 56 sell muffins at the moment , and on average � 550-worth a week . currently , they are supplied by four other bakeries . you have a good idea what their cakes are like so you know what the corner shops are buying . but how do you gauge what your share might be ? well , you could say that the other bakeries have roughly 25 % each , and all things being equal you could end up with a 20 % share . however , being new on the scene , you might expect half that to begin with - ie 10 % . so your calculation looks like this : the population of the segment 73 x the percentage who buy already 0.77 x the average sale in pounds � 550 x the average frequency 52 x a year x your expected share 0.10 = your potential revenue � 160,760 of course , this is a guesstimate , but it does give you a basis to decide which segments are priorities . so go to it . the world is your oyster ! sophie chalmers there are further articles on the topic in the solution centre : harness geography and sell more ( market research ) how to find more profitable customers ( market research ) finding out lots for next to nothing - tips from a pro ( market research ) how to inject new life into your business ( marketing ) how to get more business by using loss - leaders ( marketing ) marketing is for everyone ( marketing ) how to use a contact database to boost sales_nns _ _ richmond offers academically outstanding students the opportunity to participate in the richmond honors program . the goal of the honors program is to provide students with a variety of challenging learning opportunities both inside and outside the classroom and to help them realize their full academic potential . intercultural analysis , intellectual curiosity and independent research are three key factors that shape the variety of creative and interactive courses offered . the heart of the honors program is the interdisciplinary core seminar in which groups of honors students , led by specially richmond ’s faculty , consider ideas and issues that are defining our future world . admission new freshman or new transfer students with fewer than 45 credits will be admitted to the honors program based on appropriate high school and transfer grades , special application , and if possible , an interview . students who did not apply or were not eligible at the time of entering richmond , may apply once they have completed one or more semesters . students in the university may join the honors program if they have earned no more than 60 credits . grade point average students must achieve and maintain a grade point average ( gpa ) of 3.4 or higher to enter and stay in the honors program . this gpa matches the standard for the semester dean ’s list . if an honor student ’s gpa falls below 3.4 , he or she will be allowed one semester to raise it to the 3.4 level . program requirements honors program students will be required to take eight special honors courses . six of these courses should be from the lower division offerings . a minimum of two of these must be taken from the special lower division core seminars . core seminars will be offered in the areas listed below . at least one seminar will be scheduled each semester . globalization and internationalism the body , metaphor and identity the creative impulse ethics and values science and mythologies the core seminars are multi - disciplinary and each semester a different seminar topic and seminar leader will provide students with an opportunity to be exposed to topical issues across a range of disciplines . on occasion , guest lecturers will look at a topic from their particular discipline . these lectures will be open to the university community . the honor students in the seminar will go into more depth on someof the topics with the seminar leader during regularly scheduled seminar meetings . the remaining four lower division requirements can be satisfied by taking honors sections of courses , a range of which are offered every semester . students may substitute one or two of these for core seminars . in addition , students must complete two upper division honors requirements . one of these can be either an honors 300-level course or a one - credit honors extension to an existing course . the final capstone honors course required of all students , preferably in their senior year , is hon 400 , london as text .

it has , however , been extensively modernized . the convention floor was a vast space of which we only used a third most of the time , although another part was opened up when there was multi - programming . generally things were good with the first real room parties occurring and lots of crazy things happening on the programme : the elizabeth foyster half - hour , for example ; lee harding talking about selling ufo books to hippies ; john foyster talking about old polyps , occasionally the pulps too ; robin johnson as god in the paul stevens show ; lee harding as buck rogers in the first live radio episode seen in the round ; and ... and a rotten banquet ( but a good counter meal in the bar in the basement ) . ron smith ( who , according to a recent locus report , " recently surfaced in melbourne " after being here for ten years ! ) gave a guest of honour speech on the new range of pornographic books he intends to publish and what it was like to sleep with harlan ellison . i did n't get much sleep during the convention , all things considered ; there were all - night films and all - night listenings to ron smith and all - day talkings with lots of odd people . at once stage i drove 20 miles to go to bed , not being a resident of the con ; but i 'll live . eastercon 72 was good ;

" they wo n't attempt to use those guns if we are attacked , " said west , as he watched the preparations going on ; " our men will be quite ignorant of how to work them . " " our men will try if the necessity comes , " said ingleborough confidently ; " and that 's half the battle ! " " yes , " said west ; " but it 's hardly likely that the enemy will attack so well - armed a body of men . " " they will , though , and do us no end of mischief if they get the chance . " but the general for the first three days gave the enemy no chance , for he carefully avoided kopjes and broken ground , keeping out a cloud of mounted men scouting in every direction , and camping each night on the banks of some spruit . in fact , every military precaution was taken on defensive principles , for the captured convoy was too valuable for any risks to be run by attacking one or other of the commandos trying to hem in the brigade . it was soon found that the boers were in motion in front , rear , and on both flanks , awaiting an opportunity to swoop down and stampede sheep , cattle , and horses , spread confusion amongst the men , and so open up a chance to re - capture the guns and stores . but no chances were given , for everything had been arranged , and during seven days ' march west had a fine experience in the manoeuvring of a cavalry brigade . so , in fact , had the enemy , but theirs was at a bitter cost . finding that the british force would not attack any of the natural strongholds nor step into any of the traps contrived at river crossings where the perpendicular banks were filled with trench , pit , and shelter , but that the carefully - guarded convoy went on slowly towards safety day after day , the enemy became more daring , changed their tactics , and gathered together for attacks , getting their guns into action ready for their own captured artillery to be halted , and with a few well - directed shots at a tremendously long range to put the carefully planted guns out of action and compel a rapid retreat . if they surrounded the convoy in their thousands with knots of mounted riflemen , there was a rush , a flying cloud of dust kicked up , and away went half the horse artillery battery to one knoll , the other half to another , and before the intention of the general could be grasped the shells were falling fast among those knots , bursting and untying them in an appalling way which littered the dry earth with dead horses and men ; while , whenever a bolder dash than usual was made to capture either of the half - batteries , the boers found that , mobile as they were , the british cavalry could nearly double them in swiftness of evolution , and lancers and hussars cut them up and sent them flying in every direction . day after day this went on , with the result that the reinforcements the enemy received were pretty well balanced by the constant dribbling away of ambulance wagons loaded with wounded men . " is n't it splendid ? " ingleborough kept on saying . " why , we could go on journeying like this for months . i like this defensive game ! chess is nothing to it ! " " so do the boers like a defensive game ! " " yes , " said ingleborough , laughing . " did you hear what one of the boers taken said to the officer in command of the prisoners ' guard ? " " no . i did not catch it ; but i saw our men laughing . what was it ? " " he said our officers did not fight fair , and when our man asked him what he considered was fair fighting , the scoundrel gave him to understand that we ought to attack them when they were well entrenched in a kopje ready to shoot all our men down . " " well , " said west , " what did our officer say ? " " laughed at him , and told him that if they were so very anxious to fire at targets we would arrange butts for them with a series of mantlets and a good supply of the bisley running deer . but that was n't the best of it , " said ingleborough , laughing ; " what do you think the fellow said ? " " i do n't know , " said west , who was watching the evolutions of a couple of the light horse volunteer regiments and as many of the lancers , for , tired of the plodding life of keeping with the tremendous baggage train for a whole week , the two friends had ridden out in advance over a wide open series of rolling downs covered with dry scrubby growth , parched to greyness by the torrid sun . ingleborough laughed heartily for a few moments . " there they go , " he said , pointing to the leading troop of the hussar regiment as it disappeared over a ridge about a mile in advance . " let 's make for that wave - like place . " " very well , " said west ; " i suppose we shall be safe there ! " " safe enough , of course , for our men have swept it clear ! forward ! how the ponies enjoy a gallop ! but i did n't tell you what the miserable ruffian said . " " no , " cried west , enjoying the motion as much as the ponies . " this is delightful after all that slow walking ; but we had better turn back when we have seen what those fellows are about ! now , what did the boer say ? " " said he had always heard we were cowards at majuba ; now he knew for himself . " " the insolent hound ! " cried west . " what did our officer say ? " " that it was lucky for the boer that he was a prisoner , for if he had been free he would have tasted a flogging from the flat of a sabre . but hullo ! where are our men ? " cried ingleborough , as they reached the crown of the low ridge and looked down at a strip of open veldt , beyond which was another ridge . " gone over there ! " said west quietly . " they must have galloped ! " " shall we follow , and come back with them ? " said ingleborough . " we may as well , " was the reply ; " they must be trying to cut off some of the boers . " " or going in for a charge to scatter them , for we want no more prisoners . come on , then ; i should like to see the charge ! " the ponies seemed to share their desire , for , answering a slight pressure on their flanks , they spread out and went down the slight slope like greyhounds , avoiding as if by instinct the holes and stones with which the veldt was dotted away in front . " steady , steady ! " cried west . " we do n't want to overdo it ! " " of course not , " shouted ingleborough ; " but my word , what delicious air , and what a place for a gallop ! i should like to see a herd of antelope appear on that ridge to the left . i should be obliged to go after them ; we might get one for the officers ' mess . " " there they are , then ! " cried west . " where ? " said ingleborough . " coming over that continuation of the ridge a mile away to the left . no : mounted men ! ingle , old chap , " cried west excitedly , " they 're the party our men have cut off ! they 've headed them , and they 're trying to escape by this opening ! " " by jingo ! no ! " cried ingleborough . " our men have gone off to the right , i believe , and those boers have seen us . noll , old fellow , we 've come a bit too far . steady ! right turn ! now off and away , or somebody else will be cut off or shot ; perhaps both of us , for we 're in for it once more . " " oh no , " said west coolly ; " be steady , and we 'll show the boers how english fellows ride ! " " yes , but hang it all ! it 's showing the beggars how we ride away . " " never mind ; we must ride for the convoy . " " but we ca n't , " cried ingleborough savagely ; " there 's another party cutting us off . " " forward then over the ridge in front ! our fellows must have gone over there . " " no , i do n't think they did . " " then we will , " cried west excitedly ; " that must be south and west . forward for kimberley ; it ca n't be far now ; and let 's deliver the despatch . " " hold hard ! look before you leap ! " shouted ingleborough ; and , rising in his stirrups , he gave a hasty glance round , to see boers here , boers there , in parties of from six to a dozen , spreading out as they came along at a gallop , forming more and more of a circle , till there was an opening only in one direction -- to the south - west -- and after grasping this fully he turned to west as he settled himself in his saddle . " why , noll , lad , " he cried , " it 's like the drawing of a seine - net in cornwall , with us for the shoal of mackerel . they 've got it nearly round us , and if we do n't start , in another ten minutes we shall be enclosed . it looks fishy , and no mistake ! " " then come on ! " cried west . " off with you , but at a gentle gallop . we must nurse our nags , for the obstinate brutes will make it a long chase . " as he spoke he pressed his pony 's sides , and away they went together at a long easy gallop , their mounts keeping so close together that the riders ' legs nearly touched , and the brave little animals taking stride for stride and needing no guidance , the best management being to give them their heads and perfect freedom to avoid all the obstacles which came in their way in the shape of rock , bush , and the perilous holes burrowed in the soil by the south african representatives of our rabbits . once settled down in their saddles , with the opening in the boer net straight before them , the fugitives had no difficulty in carrying on a conversation , and this ensued in the calmest matter - of - fact way concerning the predicament in which they had landed themselves . " it 's very awkward , noll ! " said ingleborough . " but , to use your favourite argument , it seems all for the best , " replied west . " we can easily reach the open ground yonder before the enemy , and then ride right away . " " if , " said ingleborough . " if they do n't stop when they find us likely to go through the horns of the dilemma they have prepared for us . " " and lie down and begin shooting ? " " exactly ! their bullets will go faster than our ponies ! " " yes , but we shall put them at full speed , and they will find it hard to hit us at a gallop . " " i hope so ! " said ingleborough . " my word ! how they are coming on ! " " yes ; but they will not get within five hundred yards of us ! " cried west excitedly . and so it proved , for as the horns of the partly - finished circle drew nearer , that nearness proved to be nearly a thousand yards from point to point , while half - way between , and with their ponies racing over the ground stretched out like greyhounds , the two despatch - riders dashed through , forcing the enemy to alter their course as they were left behind . " that 's done it ! " cried west joyously . " now then for kimberley ; it ca n't be very far away ! " " sit close ! " cried ingleborough . " they 'll fire now if they can do so without hitting their friends . " west glanced back to his right , and saw the truth of his companion 's words , for the next minute the firing was commenced on both sides , the bullets coming over their heads with their peculiar buzzing sound , and the dusty soil being struck up here and there as the fugitives tore along . " this will put their shooting to the test ! " cried west , leaning forward to pat his pony 's neck . " yes ; it will puzzle the best of them ! " replied ingleborough . " i 'm not afraid of their marksmen , but i am of the flukes . however , we 're in for it ! easy now ! we 're getting more and more ahead as they close in . there , those behind are obliged to leave off firing for fear of hitting their friends . " ingleborough was right , for after another useless shot or two the firing ceased , and it became a chase where success , barring accidents , would rest with the best and freshest horses . knowing this , the fugitives eased their ponies all they could after placing a greater distance between them and their pursuers , but keeping a good look - out ahead and to right and left , knowing full well as they did that the appearance of fresh boers ahead would be fatal to their progress . half an hour glided by , during which first one and then the other glanced back , but always with the same result of seeing that some two or three dozen of the enemy were settled down to a steady pursuit . " how long do you think they will keep this up ? " said west at last . " well , if they are french mercenaries they 'll give up directly ; if they are germans they 'll stick to our heels for hours ; but if they 're all free staters or transvaal boers they 'll go on till they drop or we do . the stubborn , obstinate mules never know when they are beaten ! " " then they 're not french adventurers ! " said west . " nor yet germans ! " said ingleborough . " no ; we 've got the genuine boer after us ; and it 's going to be a long chase . " " how far do you think it is to kimberley ? " " just as far as it is from kimberley to here ! " replied ingleborough gruffly . " thank you for nothing ! " snapped out west . " what 's the good of giving foolish answers ? " " what 's the good of asking foolish questions ? look here , lad , we may as well look the position in the face . " " of course . " " very well , then ; we 've got a score and a half or so of boers after us , meaning to take us prisoners or shoot us down . " " oh yes , that 's plain enough ! " " very well ! then as to distance to kimberley , the general has dodged in and out so to avoid the enemy that , though i know a little about the country , i 'm regularly puzzled as to where we are . i think it lies out here , but whether kimberley is five miles away or a hundred i do n't know . what i do know is that the surest way of getting there is to make right away west for the railway . once we can hit that-- " " yes , i see , and if we keep it on our right , riding south , we shall get there . " " that 's correct , my lad , but recollect this : we left the town invested , and you may depend upon it that the enemy are round it in greater strength than ever , so that how we are to get through their lines when we reach them i do n't know . " " neither do i ! " said west . " but we did not know how we were to get into mafeking ! still we did it , and we 're going to do this somehow . " " ah , somehow ! " " look here , " said west , after another glance back at their pursuers : " do you think you could put matters in a blacker light if you were to try ? " " to be frank , old fellow , " said ingleborough , laughing , " i really do n't think i could ! " " no more do i ! " " but look here : it 's as well always to look the blackest side full in the face . then you know the worst at once , and can act accordingly . hooray ! one to us ! " shouted ingleborough , glancing back . " what is it ? i see one of the enemy broken down and another pulled up to help him . it 's two to us . " " there , you see now the good of looking at the worst of it . " " it 's quite cheering ! " cried west . " not very , for the rest are making a spurt . " " let them ! " said west . " our ponies are full of go . we will not push them unless absolutely obliged . " " words of wisdom ! a long , steady pace wins . keep on ; we can afford to lose a little ground , for we have been gaining for some time ! " | next chapter | | previous chapter | | contents | e - books created from nineteenth century or early twentieth century texts by athelstane e - texts ._. _ _ if witchcraft is the religion of the moon , druidry is , it is often said , the religion of the sun . its pubic rituals are performed in the eye of the sun , mainly during daylight , though some begin or end in the dark , for example on the solstices . of course , that is not the whole story , for druidry is above all other things the spirituality of balance . the moon is important in druidry , both for marking the passing of time in the celtic world and for working with the energies of the night as well as the day . nor do wise witches turn from the power of sunlight . historically , they needed to hold their ceremonies under cover of darkness because of the severe persecution they suffered from the fifteenth century for more than two hundred years . during this shameful period up to a quarter of a million people were killed in europe and scandinavia . indeed witchcraft was still illegal in britain until 1951 . so how did the revivalist druids of the eighteenth and nineteenth century avoid problems of persecution ? because witches were , until the 1950s , mainly working - class women while the revivalist druids were male middle class - and so regarded as eccentric , not a threat to public order . even today in some parts of the world a coven of white witches meeting in a park at broad daylight , especially with their children , would attract evangelists , police and social workers . the sun and druidesses that leads us to druidesses . though traditionally the moon has been regarded as female and associated with motherhood and fertility , there were also many sun mothers , a number of whom have survived in indigenous cultures that have followed the same way of life for thousands of years . in a number of cultures too the sun mother has a sun daughter . the celts believed that when the end of the world came the sun mother would give birth to a daughter who would herald the new order . sulis , brighid , grainne and aine are solar goddesses within the celtic tradition and ceremonies dedicated to the celtic aine and grainne survived until well into the last century and are still recalled in folk ritual . today some still have difficulty accepting sun goddesses because we look at the concept through a window distorted by two millennia of prejudice . the sun gives us warmth and light and encourages the crops to grow , nurturing , creative , life giving , female functions . not so in the classical patriarchal view of the sun as dominance and warlike , the ancient greek apollo in his chariot was always above humankind , unless stopping to seduce a nymph or usurp the power of the earth mother at the oracle at delphi . sun goddesses tended to regularly visit the fields and hilltops as lovely golden - haired women overseeing the progress of people , animals and the land . the conquering sun god was adopted along with lots of other female unfriendly symbols by collectors of world myths from the eighteenth century onwards . thus the moon image became a weak reflection of male , solar energy - and therefore always female . this was in spite of the existence of male lunar gods , for example the slavic triple moon god . myesyats who represented the three stages of the life cycle . as for the sun goddesses , they were conveniently ignored as not fitting with the brief of the researchers . of course , some sun goddesses were also deities of the moon like aine . aine 's sister grainne was the celtic solar crone goddess , who woke the fertility of the earth every spring after the long winter and may have been the original hag of winter . the top of her sacred hill at leinster , in ireland , like that of the hill of aine , was the scene for torchlight processions and bonfires at the summer solstice and the first grain harvest at the beginning of august . these ceremonies persisted into the twentieth century . so the sun of the druidesses can be both empowering and life - bringing and the same is true for druids . in northern traditions where sunlight is scarce in winter months , sun mothers are still quite prevalent . exploring the power of the sun i would suggest for druids , as well as druidesses , that it may be helpful to explore the female aspects of the sun , especially of gentle sunlight of early morning and evening . walk out in sunlight , especially sunshine that appears unexpectedly on a winter day , allowing light to warm every pore ; splash in puddles of sunlight after rain or paddle or swim in the light in the sea or a swimming pool . observe sunlight rippling on water , colouring the leaves , casting a momentary brilliant disc of radiance in the midst of shadows . go out at sunrise , noon and dusk and experience the different energies that flow through nature , urban streets and you . in your journal record the images , words , emotions and impressions that the sun evokes in you at different times of the day , the year and in different places , noting how you feel intense heat , clear sunlight or a gentle evening glow . we are lucky in the modern world that it is now so much easier for us to visit different places so that in twenty four hours we can move from summer to winter and back again . as we fly round the globe , we can watch the sun set and within an hour or so rise again . technology too can offer us via computer or satellite link images of the midnight sun in the north , of the blazing orb rising huge over the horizon in a desert , of sunlight shimmering on snow , of eclipses and the sun rays shafting a stone circle , a cathedral labyrinth or suddenly illuminating the entrance of an ancient tomb , on the midsummer or midwinter solstice . making sun water one way that you and others can imbibe the healing and energising powers of the sun is through making sun water . this is at its most potent when made on the morning of the longest day , the summer solstice , around june 21 ( december 21 in the southern hemisphere ) , during a partial eclipse or , if you are lucky enough to have one in your region , a total eclipse of the sun . however , you can also make sun water any day the sun is shining from dawn till noon . if you are in a gloomy weather period or live where the sun only shines briefly during the winter you can add extra clear quartz crystals plus a citrine to your water to boost the solar energies . fill a brass or gold - coloured bowl or one of clear crystal ( the kind used as old - fashioned fruit bowls ) with pure spring water ( you can use bottled still mineral water , much of which comes from former sacred springs ) . otherwise use rainwater collected in a vessel placed on a low roof or a water butt , unless you are in an area of high pollution . add three clear crystal quartz stones and , if you wish , surround the bowl with sunshine yellow flowers . leave the water from dawn until noon or when the sun is directly overhead in your time zone ( you can put the bowl out overnight if you do not wish to get up early , covered with fine mesh to keep out any pollution and may get some additional lunar powers ) . bottle the water in tiny clear , yellow or gold - coloured glass bottles with stoppers . antique and craft fairs are a good source of these . you can keep some in the fridge to drink . add a few drops of your sun water into baths , splash on your brow and hairline if you feel stressed or spaced out and sip to give you and infusion of energy and confidence . you can also energise plants and animals with a few drops or use it as sacred water in ritual . healing with sun water sun water will help to heal people , animals , places and species if you infuse the purpose and the name of the patient or threatened place when the water is almost ready . wait until the sun is shining directly into your bowl just before noon . stir the water three times clockwise with a clear crystal pendulum or pointed quartz crystal , naming the focus and the purpose of the water . you can either prepare small individual bowls or bottles or infuse the water with a number of purposes , stirring separately for each ; either method works . ask for healing from the highest forces of light and , as you stir the water , name the person and the illness or sorrow , the place and the cause of pollution or despoliation and infuse it with blessings . when you have stirred the water , look on to its surface and visualise the face of the person , the animal or the threatened place restored to beauty and whisper � blessings be ' , before dedicating the water to the next subject . pour out the prepared water into individual glass bottles . adding a tiny crystal quartz to each ; tie each bottle with a gold ribbon . if you know the person well and they are present , you can open the bottle in sunlight , supplementing this with golden candles or a fibre optic lamp on a dark day , so that it shines golden and anoint their brow with a few drops . you can create your own healing words , based on love and caring . with an animal , rub a little of the warmed water close to its heart , or if the animal is in pain and does not want to be touched , add it to the drinking bowl , and place the bowl in brilliant light . you can sprinkle the water around a photograph of absent people , animals , species or places , suffusing the picture in brilliant light , while expressing your concerns and desire for healing . if the place is local or you can visit it , sprinkle the water on the ground or in the polluted water source you can send the rest of the bottle of sun water to the sick person , with a small citrine as a gift , saying that it comes with your love , with a note explaining how and why you made it . awen and the sun if you attend or watch a public druidic ceremony , you will hear those assembled and maybe be asked to join in calling nine awens . rather like the buddhist mantra aum , this is the druidic name for the life and inspirational force of generation behind the universe that is linked with the sun . some druid / esses identify this as the sound that called forth creation . books will tell you that this is pronounced aah - oo - en , or aah - oo wen , as three equally weighted syllables as a monotone . but , in practice , when you have a lot of people calling awen in the dusk or early dawn light , the sounds merge so that it becomes more like the sound of the sea , of wind rippling through plains of corn or the call of the birds going home at night , especially if it is called on a rising note . so practise calling awens , three , six or nine in monotones . then as though you were ascending or descending scales , sing in a cave , a tunnel , in dense woodland in a valley of rocks or an old quarry and let the echoes swell your voice . sing it as you walk , dance it in your grove , swim it through water and so the sound will become a part of you , like aum , a creative sound that fills you with power and certainty and you no longer worry you are saying it correctly . awen is also a symbol drawn by druidesses and druids as a way of invoking and sending blessings ( it is popular at the end of druidic e - mails and can easily and legally be downloaded by right - clicking on the image and select " save as " for non commercial purposes ) . it consists of the three rays of the sun . i have seen two completely different explanations for its form . one says that at the time of the midsummer sunrise , the sun casts three spreading rays of light , the awen , which open the gates of annwyn , the doorway to the otherworld . the other view is that they represent the points at which the sun rises on the equinoxes and solstices , that is due east at the time of the equinoxes , as represented by the central bar of the awen . a the time of the summer and winter solstices the sun rises in the east - north - east and the east - south - east respectively , these would form the bars on either side . an awen turned to face the east shows the direction of the winter and summer solstice sunrises . though the awen sign is itself not ancient , the formation of the three sunrises was marked by three stones outside a number of stone circles . the origins of awen while the concept of awen and its solar connections are popularly regarded as revivalist , rather than an ancient celtic symbol , some druidessess and druids do believe that awen , translated as flowing spirit , may be an ancient concept that was christianised . they point to such examples as tales of the sixth century bard taliesin ( although these tales were recorded centuries later ) who claimed to have received three drops of awen that splashed from the cauldron of cerridwen and these three drops are depicted in some symbols of awen , falling from the sky . of course , if awen does come from the cauldron of cerridwen then this solar power is female - inspired and directed and the solar connection is that it is brewed from herbs and flowers that grow in the sun . it represents a rebirth into light , such as the boy gwion experienced when he was swallowed in the form of a grain by cerridwen in the shape of a hen and was reborn from her womb as the bard / magician taliesin nine months later . gwion , foster son of cerridwen , was stirring the cauldron at the time and claimed that three drops of inspiration splashed on his fingers accidentally , an explanation not accepted by the irate cerridwen who pursued him in animal different forms in what has become a classic example of shapeshifting . this awen or inspiration was , as i mentioned earlier , endowed by women priestesss / druidesses at early druid initiations , for example at pentre ifan in pembrokeshire . initiates would remain in total darkness for several days awaiting rebirth . here , nine virgin piriestesses / druidesses would stir and breathe the pure life force on a cauldron in which a sun brew of barley , flowers , herbs and sea foam was created . the would - be bards each drank three drops to represent gwion 's three drops of inspiration that he stole from the cauldron and the rest was poured away to symbolise cast the former life of the initiate this may originally have been a solar goddess ceremony and may predate the druid tradition and the three bars may have represented the triple or three aspected goddess brighid , goddess of the sun and of fire . the rays are sometimes positioned within the centre of a triple circle to represent the three celtic realms , earth , sea and sky or the circles of existence and the passage of the soul or simply enclosed in a circle . working with awen , the inspiration of the sun all this is pretty exciting � gateways of light into other realms and absorbing drops of inspiration or liquid light , distilled from the sun at its times of power and brewed in the cauldron of cerridwen . so before we continue further into the philosophical and inspirational aspects of awen let us make and use this sun symbol to access that doorway and absorb the power of the sun into our lives , winter or summer draw your awen in sand , earth or soil or create one out of seeds , nuts or twigs and surround it with a circle to focus and concentrate the power . alternatively , as i have done , create one out of small stones or shells in your garden and surround it with an enclosing circle of stones . work in sunlight when you can so the circle is filled with light and the pebbles gleam ( you could of course use glass nuggets ) when it snows the sun will melt away the whiteness leaving the symbol intact . indoors , you can create a miniature one from clay or on paper or create one with tiny quartz and citrine crystals to catch the sunlight , using perspex rainbows and sun catchers at the windows if necessary amplified by golden candles . stand or sit facing south at the point where the three sunbeams converge . work at the brightest part of the day , visualising brilliance if the day or season is dark . visualise one of the beautiful celtic sun or fire goddesses haloed around the sun ( remember brighid hanging her cloak on the sun wheel ? ) . visualise cerridwen directly ahead of you , stirring a cauldron of pure gold whose essence radiates as a rich rivulet of liquid gold around your circle . feel also the golden soil of the earth mothers warming you beneath , heated by the molten volcanic forces , the sun beneath the surface of the world breathe in the golden light through your nose , slowly and gently , exhaling darkness until you create a steady continuous rhythm and are no longer aware of your breathing but only the inflow of light from all around you , above and beneath and around into every pore . as you continue breathing , visualise the light upwards , from your toes right to the tips of you fingers , downwards through the crown of your head , inwards like a rushing waterfall of light , in which up is down , in is out and you are the light . begin your call � awen ' , at first low and slowly and then higher and with greater intensity but maintaining a comfortable pitch so you do not tip over and lose the sense of control and stillness within the cascading light water . continue until you can see light radiating from within you and you are connected with the source of power and inspiration . hold the moment when you feel totally at one with solar power and then allow the awens to slowly fade and become slower until they are no more than a whisper and at last return to the heart of stillness and silence . make a sign , perhaps the awen , in the palm of your hand , knowing that if you are far from home or anxious you can recall your sun circle and become once more connected to the light . if as you work through this ritual you place beside you or hold a clear quartz crystal or citrine within the circle it will become empowered and you can paint on it in gold after the ritual the awen symbol to keep you powerful and protected . allow the radiance also to fade slowly knowing it is always with you though unseen , for you are a daughter or son of the light . thank the sun goddess and wise cerridwen who has watched over you while you work and she may reward you with a few words of inspiration or a creative surge that can be manifest in your life if your awen is only a temporary one , one erase it or if permanent bury a small offering such as a crystal or a few herbs close to the sign . awen , inspiration and your life . there are numerous ways of obtaining the inspiration of awen . as you learn more about druidry , you may find that your spiritual and psychic awareness spontaneously evolve . as your words become more measured and less impetuous and situation driven , so they are wiser and in times of quietness , may even assume a prophetic ring . this may seem frightening , but it is a natural development . so , too , may you find creativity in all its forms permeating even seemingly mundane aspects of your life , filling them with beauty and meaning for yourself and those with whom you come into contact . to the modern druidess , especially one whose definition of inspiration may be less tinged with aspirations towards mediaeval bardship ( and mercifully less inclined to keep people sitting on a freezing hillside listening to her poetic renditions ) the flowing life force may assume more practical applications . the trend is spreading throughout druidry despite pockets of resistance , that it is a living faith , as much at home in the workplace and the shopping mall as in a grove or stone circle . it is seen as more important to practise than to preach . so the celtic solar goddesses sulis , aine and grainne actually walked the fields and hilltops in their summer finery , not only indicating the time of harvest but helping , no doubt to cheer a tired worker or soothe a crying baby . then in the celebrations of harvest home leading the processions , they bound their spirit into the corn maiden created from the last sheaf . your awen inspiration can prompt a period of channelled activity . this may involve problem solving and creative decision - making , or channelling and developing healing powers to bring peace and reconciliation to colleagues , neighbours and even stressed strangers . you may paint rooms and houses as well as pictures to brighten the lives of others and yourself . digging , planting and weeding gardens or window boxes and nurturing new plant life can be an act of druidic faith as can singing fretful children to sleep . sculpting or putting up shelves , really caring about providing after school centres for children , preserving areas of wildlife from developers by peaceful but determined effort , all help to spread praise and positivity in a negative , cynical world . an awen ritual , opening the doorway however , there are times for personal ceremonial when inspiration is needed on the very deepest of levels , perhaps because an unexpected setback has shaken the roots of your confidence . we know the doorway is there in the awen and so there may be times when we wish to look through it , though we may not choose to pass . begin once more by creating your awen within a circle . this time draw the three drops of inspiration falling into it . on the first ( from the left ) awen ray put a dish of sun herbs , bay , juniper , rosemary , sagebrush ( american or australian broad � leafed sage ) , saffron , st john 's wort . on the second awen ray , set a golden candle , beeswax if possible , have it in a broad - based holder or on a small metal tray for safety . on the third sun ray place a tiny gold - coloured or clear glass dish of sun water . if you work about noon , the ideal time , you could have left your sun water within the awen circle to gather power from dawn ; on each of the three drops of inspiration set a round crystal quartz . sit within the circle in front of the awen facing south and the three drops of inspiration are furthest from you . begin by carrying out the earlier ritual to fill yourself with radiance , but this time as you slow your awens , maintain the vision of the radiance . take a few grains of sun herbs and drop them into the candle flame , saying � awen , ever flowing stream , i bring sun to your sun . grant me , i ask , one drop of your sacred inspiration to flow within me , brewed in the cauldron of the mother . ' dipping the index finger of your power hand into the sun water , drink a single drop and . say : � blessings be . ' repeat for the second and third drops , each time burning a few grains of herb and asking for inspiration , drinking the single drop and giving thanks . after the third drop , after � blessings be ' , add : � thus do i approach the doorway into light . i ask that i may see within what is right for me to know . i put my faith in the sun . ' focus on the three crystals and allow them to merge with the awen symbol that will glisten pure gold and expand into a gold and crystalline doorway that will slowly open revealing golden light . blink and as you open your eyes you will see perhaps a single image framed against the radiance before it closes . now in turn , take each of the crystal drops and cast them into the sun water , asking for each an area of your life in which you need , creativity , inspiration or fertility . you may hear words in your head or see a sudden image in the water that will make sense in your dreams that night or during quiet reveries . accept whatever you are given as a blessing . sit quietly and when you are ready , blow out the candle , sending love and light to anyone you know who is sick or distressed . if your awen is only temporary , as before erase it . but before you do so , bury the three crystals and the remaining herbs near the centre . if it is a permanent garden awen , pour the rest of the sun water on it to purify it and again bury your offerings . over the months you may look for longer into the doorway and you may wish to stand in the entrance . you need not be afraid that you will be carried off psychically into the otherworld and from the doorway you will see only light and beauty , in time you may have glimpses of your own unique vision of the otherworld , what constitutes for each individual eternal happiness and peace . the celtc druid / esses and their priestess forebears lived much closer to nature and could move from dimension to dimension as easily as we pass into the next room . druidesses and druids today have usually had to choose the earthly path . we have no communities to support us or free access throughout our physical world without danger from other tribes . so until we begin our own special final journey into eternity , we may have to be content with precious glimpses that fill us with confidence that our souls are immortal and that this is only the first part or a forgetful staging post of our voyage through many lifetimes into the lands of radiance . the seasons of the sun in the chapter on the druidic wheel of the year ( modern day druidess ) i have described the seasonal celebrations at the solar change points , the equinoxes and solstices whose differing energies allow us to work with their particular qualities and absorb these strengths into our own life , as we carry out rites like our ancestors for the necessary turning of the seasonal wheel . but within each day too the sun wheel turns and so we can work at these solar highs and lows to restore our connection with nature and absorb the strengths we need . this does not have to be with formal ritual . if you light a candle , for example , to welcome the dusk and sit enfolded by the fading light you can focus on a point on the horizon and ride the gentle daily downturn of the wheel . of course , you may be a shift worker or still have a mountain of paperwork to complete before home time . or you may have to brace yourself for the arrival home of the family and all their different demands . but that brief oasis of stillness at dusk can switch off the more frantic centres in your brain and bring a harmony to your spirit that will enable you to finish serenely in half the time when all around you are fretting and twitching in overdrive . sun times dawn varies each day and can be found in a diary or the weather section of a newspaper . unless you live on the line marking gmt , the sun will not be exactly overhead at noon , so work either with your own local noon time when the sun is directly above you . dusk also varies each evening . when you have a free weekend or a few days , live by the four markers : dawn , noon , dusk and midnight . experience the different energies out of doors and following the rhythms of the sky as our ancestors did , before the advent of electricity . if you are afraid of the dark , work just before dawn initially so that you can witness the inevitable return of light - to our ancient forebears this was a matter of trust , so if you can learn to trust again , you will relax . dawn this is a very special point in druidry as the sunrise at the midsummer or midwinter solstice especially symbolise the birth or rebirth of light . many stone circles and passage graves are aligned to sunrise on special days ; in the christian tradition too , the importance of these special sunrises is recognised . for example , in the centre of the large octagonal labyrinth in amiens cathedral in picardy in france , a shaft of sunlight filters on the mid winter and the summer solstice ( around june 21 ) . the centre of the labyrinth in the nave of amiens cathedral corresponds with the spring equinox and is represented in ritual by facing east . however , since the sun only rises in the true east ( and sets in the west ) on the equinoxes , you may wish to work with its actual position of the sun in the sky when dawn breaks . it is worth rising early to sit or stand and witness the beautiful patterns as darkness retreats , sometimes not without struggle . dawns are different , in winter , in summer , in bad weather or during a clear period , over plains , in deserts , over the sea , above mountains in forests . walk in the quiet of the city before it wakes or the countryside or watch the darkness receding over the sea , leaving the scarlet tinged waves . every dawn is a spring equinox written small , a resurrection , the birth of new hope . today is the day you anticipated or feared in many sleepless nights or anxious moments . so walk into the dawn with courage , yelling your defiance or your belief you will win through or that this day will be absolutely the best one ever , because you will make it so . noon be not sad , be as the sun at midday says a passage in the i ching and so whether the sun is beating down or hiding behind sullen clouds , the noon energies are powerful and so are you . like the summer solstice whose microcosm or mini - version it is , the sun king rose in triumph . the view from the top of the solar ferris wheel is quite spectacular . therefore at every noon as at every summer solstice count your blessings . if they are thin on the ground , seize some of that sun power , reflecting it through a crystal quartz sphere ( even the tiniest one will be bursting with sun power ) . allow the reflected light to fill you with energy and assurance that all will be well . remember , too , the channel the light and power of noon into your healing work , hold your crystal quartz or crystal sphere ( size does not matter ) to reflect the light . speak into the crystal words of healing and direct the rays or light beams to whoever or whatever needs healing , person , animal or place . you may be rewarded by a sudden tiny rainbow in the centre of the crystal , confirming that positive thoughts returns to the sender three fold . dusk � never let the sun go down on anger , ' my late mother used to say . this is the daily message of dusk , writ large in the autumn equinox . what is gained and what is lost all merge into the darkness and with them we can drain resentment , regrets and also crowing triumphantly a moment or two too long . so dusk is a good time if near water to cast a stone or a flower expressing regrets . or bury the stone of a fruit or a few seeds that will in the future bear fruit and blossom from what has been perhaps too dearly learned . as you light your dusk candle if you are at home ( easier after long summer nights when dusk is late ) , you can speak words of blessings on your enemies and consign the day to be reworked in the darkness . then as shadows soften harsh emotions you can if you need send reconciliatory letters or e - mails , make soothing phone calls , or speak in person your love or forgiveness , if only to yourself if another person is implacable . if all is well in your world , you can share your own peace and happiness perhaps with someone who always goes home alone and wishes it were otherwise , to a friend or family member far from home in a hotel room or at college who draws the curtains on the darkness or a neighbour who would welcome a brief visit before you settle down either contentedly in your own castle or with loved ones for the evening . as i said earlier , you can make a dusk oasis even if you are at work and then perhaps light a candle and have a simple dusk ritual later when you do arrive home , reading a list of the names of people and places you know are in need . midnight an unlikely sun time , but an important one as it corresponds with the midwinter solstice the rebirth of light just as sunset began a new day for the celts , so in the modern world midnight is the transition . you may be awake because you have been out socially or entertaining friends , you may be a shift worker or have returned home late from work or travelling . or you may be lying awake worried about people or tomorrow or next year and this is a time when dragons can loom large . the darkest hour is before the dawn is another popular saying that rings of truth . but in another time zone the sun is shining brightly and we know , unlike our distant forebears , that the sun does not disappear into the sea or back into the womb of the earth mother to sleep until morning . midnight too is the time of the wise ancestors , not of frightening phantoms who will haunt you . , but the gentle essences stretching back through time , those who spiritually and genetically have made you what you are ; so to with you at the midnight hour are the guardians of the night who protect you in these waking hours before dawn and who will carry you into peaceful sleep if you lie down and let their faces form . but first let float on the dark tide that even now is turning , all those things from the past , the old voices of doubt or unfair criticism that wound us when we are children and vulnerable and may return to haunt us in the night ; let float also what can not now be , name your worries and whatever keeps you awake or surfaces when you are trying to relax . burn them in a dark blue candle as black threads or wool and when you are done , send the light as you extinguish it to the sun , knowing that it will return to light the dawn ._. _ _ the drifters are back on tour ! performing all their number one hits to a new generation of music lovers , this amazing show , complete with a fantastic live band includes worldwide hits such as sittin ' in the back row , there goes my first love saturday night at the movies , come on over to my place , you 're more than a number in my little red book , and many more ! thursday 2nd march at 7.30pm tickets : � 18 , � 16 . boxes ( to seat 2 ) : � 40 qdos presents louis hoover after dark louis hoover , ex -

2005 mornington crescent - the history the game of mornington crescent was invented in the late nineteenth century by the drivers of hackney carriages as a serious attempt to design a one - way system around the increasingly busy area of euston in london . it is variously credited to arthur mowe , a cockney , and horstmann ure , a second generation silesian immigrant . a simple , but profitable , variation on the game is still played by london taxi drivers , because their motto is " he was a stranger , and i took him in " . cabbies try to include mornington crescent in every journey . this helps to maximise fares for journeys which would not naturally contain a diversion via the euston district . an edinburgh , scotland , taxi driver holds the current unofficial record . fraser mcfurtive ( 37 ) managed to include mornington crescent in a journey between drumsheugh gardens and milton road west ( both in edinburgh ) , on the excuse that he was avoiding congestion in princes street ( without mentioning that there is also a princes street in london ) . sven ( 48 , 26 , 27 ) , a muscular swedish taxi driver , is currently a contender for the distance title . he is en route between kongsgatan and tegelbacken ( both in stockholm ) , but , like most of us , has so far failed to reach mornington crescent , though he has been in london for several years now . it has been contended that , since his passenger returned to stockholm by air in 1993 , his attempt ought to be declared null and void . but not yet ... hey , give the guy a chance ! declare it null and void when he 's finished . a totally different game of the same name is played on bbc radio .. regrettably , mostly for laughs . to their credit , however , the radio - based exponents of the game are very fast on their feet , since they do not have to travel anywhere . they have contributed some of the more recent rule changes , including " begging and pleading " ( an end - game decoration ) and " gruntfuttock 's posture " ( in which the moves of the game are retrospectively altered in order to favour one player or another - also known as " editing the broadcast tape " ) . today , the real game is played by grizzled aficionados ( though it is not necessary to be foreign ) without the aid of the london a - z or the map of the london underground . in fact , even the penguin - keepers ' yearbook is outlawed from the professional game , which attracts hushed groups of onlookers on street corners from ouagadougou to ulan bator , and even basingstoke . mornington crescent - the game there can not be anyone in the civilised world who does not already know the basic rules of mornington crescent , so we shall not insult our readers by re - iterating them here . suffice to say , if you have temporarily forgotten them , or if you come from , say , the uncivilised world , such as , for example , france , you will certainly pick them up as you go along . beginners will discover that mornington crescent is a little like golf , a little like shove - ha'penny , quite a lot like watching your laundry in the tumble - drier , and most closely resembles feeling around in the dark for a pocketful of loose change dropped in an unlit , damp alleyway on a saturday night after a few beers . that is to say : frustrating , hard on the right forefinger , disorienting , even more disorienting , sheer hell on the right forefinger , and frustrating ... probably in that order . the game as presented here is , of course , a cut - down version . nevertheless , it has all the characteristics of the real game , and the computer plays only slightly less well than a human player , giving the novice a fighting chance . it is based on a portion of the london underground system , as it was prior to 1971 . this computer version has 36 place names , as opposed to the 26,000 or so in the full game , and it may be thought a little niggardly . we do not consider this to be a bad thing , because it encourages subtlety , as you will see . watch out for a change of rules between games , and even during games . this is one of the best features of the game , as you probably know . oh ... and please remember that your score will be sent to your employer as part of your next staff assessment ; may be quoted in court in the event of a character reference being required ; and a good score , accredited by samantha , will shortly be necessary in the states of california and utah when applying for a licence to impersonate marcel marceau in a public place , so , please , no cheating ! you have been warned . since your computer can legally impersonate marcel marceau without a permit , you may find it cheats quite readily . however , computers are rather unsophisticated in deception , and you will quickly recognise its little ploys . we favour a sharp kick to the turbo button as a discipline , but others prefer just to withdraw power until it promises to behave . now play ! warning : at least one 1996 version of internet explorer has a java jit compiler which malfunctions with this applet . either upgrade your ie version ( often a good idea anyway ) or switch off java jit in view / options / advanced . return to the amusements page return to the top of this page back to amazon index ... once you have a basic skill , or if my applet fails to work for you , you may like to pit your wits against other human players . there are a number of excellent sites , especially the following : the refined and delightful dan parslow mornington crescent server the very orange mornington crescent server mc 5 -

" ) by honore de balzac translated by ellen marriage and clara bell la grande breteche " ah ! madame , " replied the doctor , " i have some appalling stories in my collection . but each one has its proper hour in a conversation -- you know the pretty jest recorded by chamfort , and said to the duc de fronsac : ' between your sally and the present moment lie ten bottles of champagne . ' " " but it is two in the morning , and the story of rosina has prepared us , " said the mistress of the house . " tell us , monsieur bianchon ! " was the cry on every side . the obliging doctor bowed , and silence reigned . " at about a hundred paces from vendome , on the banks of the loir , " said he , " stands an old brown house , crowned with very high roofs , and so completely isolated that there is nothing near it , not even a fetid tannery or a squalid tavern , such as are commonly seen outside small towns . in front of this house is a garden down to the river , where the box shrubs , formerly clipped close to edge the walks , now straggle at their own will . a few willows , rooted in the stream , have grown up quickly like an enclosing fence , and half hide the house . the wild plants we call weeds have clothed the bank with their beautiful luxuriance . the fruit - trees , neglected for these ten years past , no longer bear a crop , and their suckers have formed a thicket . the espaliers are like a copse . the paths , once graveled , are overgrown with purslane ; but , to be accurate there is no trace of a path . " looking down from the hilltop , to which cling the ruins of the old castle of the dukes of vendome , the only spot whence the eye can see into this enclosure , we think that at a time , difficult now to determine , this spot of earth must have been the joy of some country gentleman devoted to roses and tulips , in a word , to horticulture , but above all a lover of choice fruit . an arbor is visible , or rather the wreck of an arbor , and under it a table still stands not entirely destroyed by time . at the aspect of this garden that is no more , the negative joys of the peaceful life of the provinces may be divined as we divine the history of a worthy tradesman when we read the epitaph on his tomb . to complete the mournful and tender impressions which seize the soul , on one of the walls there is a sundial graced with this homely christian motto , ' ultimam cogita . ' " the roof of this house is dreadfully dilapidated ; the outside shutters are always closed ; the balconies are hung with swallows ' nests ; the doors are for ever shut . straggling grasses have outlined the flagstones of the steps with green ; the ironwork is rusty . moon and sun , winter , summer , and snow have eaten into the wood , warped the boards , peeled off the paint . the dreary silence is broken only by birds and cats , polecats , rats , and mice , free to scamper round , and fight , and eat each other . an invisible hand has written over it all : ' mystery . ' " if , prompted by curiosity , you go to look at this house from the street , you will see a large gate , with a round - arched top ; the children have made many holes in it . i learned later that this door had been blocked for ten years . through these irregular breaches you will see that the side towards the courtyard is in perfect harmony with the side towards the garden . the same ruin prevails . tufts of weeds outline the paving - stones ; the walls are scored by enormous cracks , and the blackened coping is laced with a thousand festoons of pellitory . the stone steps are disjointed ; the bell - cord is rotten ; the gutter - spouts broken . what fire from heaven could have fallen there ? by what decree has salt been sown on this dwelling ? has god been mocked here ? or was france betrayed ? these are the questions we ask ourselves . reptiles crawl over it , but give no reply . this empty and deserted house is a vast enigma of which the answer is known to none . " it was formerly a little domain , held in fief , and is known as la grande breteche . during my stay at vendome , where despleins had left me in charge of a rich patient , the sight of this strange dwelling became one of my keenest pleasures . was it not far better than a ruin ? certain memories of indisputable authenticity attach themselves to a ruin ; but this house , still standing , though being slowly destroyed by an avenging hand , contained a secret , an unrevealed thought . at the very least , it testified to a caprice . more than once in the evening i boarded the hedge , run wild , which surrounded the enclosure . i braved scratches , i got into this ownerless garden , this plot which was no longer public or private ; i lingered there for hours gazing at the disorder . i would not , as the price of the story to which this strange scene no doubt was due , have asked a single question of any gossiping native . on that spot i wove delightful romances , and abandoned myself to little debauches of melancholy which enchanted me ._. _ _ the latest news and events are only a click away if you have a modern mobile phone that can access the internet ( also known as wap ) . bookmarking our mobile home page - http://wap.wessexscene.co.uk - will give you access to all the latest news . preview the wap version of the wessex scene online ( if for some reason you get a message that says " address not reachable " when using the yahoo wap emulator then just click the " view page " button and it will display the page correctly ) so what can you get in from the mobile ( wap ) edition of the wessex scene online ?

' ( prayer book , 1662 ) ' and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free . ' ( st. john 's gospel , ch.8 , v.32 ) there is a paradox at the heart of much recent social thinking in the christian churches . it has been nurtured and inspired by appeals to ecumenism and to dialogue between different theological traditions . but liberation theology , and the other activist political theologies it has spawned ( 1 ) , are not marked by these same traits of eclecticism and of dialogue . instead there is constant emphasis on socialist political perspectives and themes , and a rigid exclusion of alternatives . this paradox needs to be examined if these new theologies are to be understood . and just as much attention must be given to the themes and topics which these theologies ignore as to those they choose to emphasise . liberation theology has one characteristic tenet . it is that theology should be grounded in the here and now of people 's lives and their local experiences , often via the establishment of basic or grassroots communities . its emphasis is thus on the social and political rather than on the relationship of individuals to god and the salvation of the individual soul . and it is a world , or a universe , away from theology 's traditional concern with eternal and transcendental beliefs and truths . liberation theology 's central injunction is to take sides with the poor and the oppressed . its practitioners thus inevitably become involved in specific local issues and concerns which are then reinterpreted using the terms and language of traditional theology . there is thus not one but a myriad of liberation theologies . they all use similar language but they focus on different local issues .(2 ) the result is to relativise theology - to undermine any commitment to universality or to enduring values and beliefs . there are close parallels here with the growth of relativism in the academic world in the 1960s and 1970s which took place at just the same time as the emergence of liberation theology .(3 ) in each case the stress on relativism left a vacuum - both moral and intellectual - which was subsequently filled by the ever available world - view of marxism which is at the same time relativising in its attacks on other values and world - views , and absolutist in its holistic claims in the moral and intellectual spheres . and this jump from an eclectic and ecumenical relativism to the most dogmatic of ideologies was much encouraged and even stimulated by the marxists themselves .(4 ) but there is one common trait shared by all liberation theologies and by other activist political theologies too . they are all very critical of the societies in which they are located which , inevitably , are those societies which do not forbid open public criticism of their values , practices and institutions . that such criticisms can be made is not surprising . there is always much which can be criticised in any society . and , in open societies , institutions of public criticism are prized both for providing essential limitations on the exercise of power and for pointing the way to necessary reforms and changes . but these criticisms of open societies are amplified and made much more powerful in two interlinked ways . first , similar criticism can never be expressed in any enduring way in closed totalitarian societies - such as existing marxist societies . secondly , they are accompanied by a frequently unstated assumption about the possibilities of creating a perfect society here on earth . from this viewpoint any imperfection in society is regarded as a condemnation . and this state of mind soon leads to demands for root and branch changes to which the perfectibilist and utopian claims of prerevolutionary marxism are ideally suited . the undermining of the moral , spiritual and political values of open societies is taken further by an orwellian redefinition of many of the key concepts of both christianity and of liberal democratic politics . the major shift in christian language is from an individual to a collectivist meaning for sin and evil . original sin and the capacity for evil within every individual are virtually ignored .(5 ) and since men , and women too , are born good , the manifest existence of evils in the world must be a product of society . social institutions thus become the focus of all evil and salvation becomes not the saving of the soul of the individual but the radical restructuring of the evil society . by a similar shift , mission has ceased to mean bringing individuals to a knowledge of christian doctrine and the gospel . it now focuses on the identification of social and political evils and on fostering the political action needed to introduce a new socio - economic order which is invariably socialist in tone . to play an active part in this process is now what it means to be a disciple of christ . many political terms have been similarly redefined so as to take on a collective rather than an individualistic meaning . perhaps the most important are peace which now means the absence not only of physical violence but of a structural violence that can include the international monetary system ( but not the gulag ) ; justice which concerns itself solely with what is called egalitarian distributive or social justice and not with the right of individuals to a fair trial according to established law and the rules of natural justice ; equality which means a similarly egalitarian equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity for individuals ; and , of course , liberation which now means to play a part in the correct social and political revolutionary movement rather than the realisation of the potential of each individual under the eye and in the service of god . the purpose of these redefinitions seems to be to try to capture the moral high ground exclusively for the advocates of the new activist political theologies . those who do not agree can even be described as supporters of demonic forces which are claimed to have their origins in political theology or in what is called ' the theology of structural sin ' . ( 6 ) and such writers invariably locate demonic forces within the social and political structures of the open societies of the west . yet this is a monstrous inversion . if any societies in the 20 th century have had demonic qualities and have embodied evil in their very core , it is the closed totalitarian societies such as national socialist germany and the soviet union in which all social institutions are dominated by a single imposed ideology . and this claim in backed by their practical record of slaughtering millions of their own people . ( 7 ) ' what then must we do ? ' faced with this almost total transformation of traditional christian beliefs and theologies , what then must we do ? for many christians the answer is to turn their back on what many regard as a mistake but others consider a major and possibly deliberate distortion . for these christians , what we should do is to hold to our traditional beliefs concerning sin , salvation and the gospel , and emphasise the needs of the individual in our pastoral work . as edward norman contends , we should argue ' for the separation of individual christian action from the corporate witness of the church , and . . . regard christianity as being by nature concerned primarily with the relationship of the soul to eternity . ' ( 8) or , in the words of the gospel , ' render therefore to caesar to things of caesar , and to god the things of god . ' ( 9 ) these arguments have considerable force , appealing as they do to the vast body of traditional christian teaching and experience . but is this enough ? or is it an attempt to return to a lost age of innocence ? in all our responses to tradition , we surely need to seek out the living core from the merely conventional or habitual . and we also need , in the service of god and of truth , to bring all our resources - spiritual , moral , rational , emotional , intellectual and practical - to bear on the major social and political questions which we all face because we , uniquely amongst the generations , live in the closing decades of the 20 th century . in facing such questions , tradition must be our guide but not our master . but face them we must if we are not to leave the best of the next generation to the one - sided views of the activist political theologians . in so doing we need to take careful note of what these theologies say and do . but we must take even more careful note of what , for whatever reason , they fail to say or to consider or to do . for it can be very fruitful to study the outlines of what sociologists call the hidden agenda even if , by its nature , it must be tacit or implicit . asymmetry of criticism since the social and political criticism of activist political theologians is local in focus , they almost invariably restrict themselves to criticism of their own societies , which of necessity must be societies which permit at least some degree of open public criticism . these theologians therefore omit criticism of , and often fail to consider any evidence about , societies other than their own . this is both misleading and intellectually inadequate , if not dishonest . it is a cardinal rule of the social sciences that only by comparative analysis of different kinds of society can it be seen whether certain problems are unique , or specific to a particular kind of society , or universal , and , if they are not unique , whether the problems are worse in one kind of society rather than another . this self - imposed tunnel vision of the activist political theologians means that they pay virtually no attention to existing marxist societies which go to great lengths to suppress both internal and external criticism . in particular , they do not consider the attempts to eradicate christianity in these societies and the very severe repression to which all religions are still subjected . the marginal , precarious and precisely controlled forebearance extended towards christianity in marxist societies certainly does not extend to activist political and social action of a dissident kind such as that advocated by liberation theology . on the contrary , the major condition for public recognition of any religious denomination is its total exclusion from such political and social activities and its public support for both the internal and the foreign policies of the ruling communist party . nor do the activist political theologians consider the uniformly repressive and totalitarian features of such societies which extend throughout their legal and political structures , their information media , their educational and cultural institutions , their centralised command economies and their attitudes to alternative ideologies and to dissent . least of all , and most surprising given their own proclaimed ' preferential option for the poor ' , do they consider the massive structural inequalities of power , status , privilege , material possessions , welfare and health care in such societies and the fact that the poor and the workers , in whose name the marxist revolution was conducted , are worse off and more harshly treated in marxist societies than in open liberal societies . unconsidered questions the activist political theologians are much concerned with economics , they focus their attention on the material conditions in their own societies - what they describe as the oppression of the poor . their harshest words are reserved for capitalism which is almost invariably seen as the major source of exploitation and evil . and yet in their writings they give no serious consideration to any of the major schools of either micro or macro economic thought whether they be neo - classical , austrian or keynesian in inspiration . and this is even true of the major schools of development economics - a subject which deals directly with the economic analysis of the very countries of which they write . they do not discuss , for example , the work of rostow or the advocates of development by central planning or the micro economic studies of peter bauer . in this they are not ecumenical or eclectic . the main policy they advocate is a utopian socialism unsullied by any consideration of alternatives and ungrounded in any serious economic analysis . their discussions on matters of social policy are similarly crude . nowhere , for example , do they consider even the major works concerned with welfare capitalism let alone some recent critics of this viewpoint such as walter williams , thomas sowell or charles murray . ( 10 ) but they also neglect or ignore many wider questions that bear directly on their central concern with the material condition of the people in the less prosperous countries of the world . the 20 th century has seen the spread to many parts of the world of the forces which , in the 19 th century , made the nations of europe the most powerful and influential on earth - industrialisation , rising standards of living and rising populations , the rapid development of science and technology and of medicine , both therapeutic and preventative , and the growth of mechanised and scientific agriculture . these forces have changed , and are continuing to change , most countries in the world in ways that are just as fundamental as the changes in europe over the 200 years since the beginning of the industrial revolution . one result has been a massive growth in the world 's population , which has tripled over the last 100 years , and an even more massive growth in energy consumption which has grown six times as fast as the growth in population . but this growth has not been uniform across the world . the population of europe grew most rapidly in the 19 th century - by 140 % on average - and in the 20 th century this growth has slowed considerably . by contrast the population of the rest of the world grew only slowly in the 19 th century by about 50 % on average - but in the 20 th century it has risen by about 140 % so far . and there is much more to come because many in these growing populations are so young and have yet to have children of their own . this rapid , and very recent , growth of population across the world is primarily due to the world - wide spread of industrialisation , much of it based on science and technology , and to the benefits brought by improvements in agriculture and by modern scientific medicine . because of these forces , many hundreds of millions of people are alive today who would have died in infancy or childhood at any time in the past . and if modern science , technology and medicine were to vanish from the world or be severely limited , many hundreds of millions of people would die . the death toll arising from the loss of our sources of energy , from the loss of mechanised and scientific agriculture and from the abandonment of scientific medicine and preventative health care would completely overshadow that from any previous period in world history - whether it be the black death , the two world wars of this century , hitler 's concentration camps or stalin 's gulag archipelago . systems of spontaneous order it is not just the currently existing body of scientific and technological knowledge that is important . we also need to be aware of how it develops and how its application can foster the vast increase in material prosperity which has accompanied the rise in populations . this means that the operation of economies based on free markets , whether local , national or international , need to be considered fully and carefully . it is quite inadequate to discuss market economies primarily in terms of profit interpreted as a measure of exploitation . this is to accept a marxist analysis on its own terms . rather it is vital to see free market economies as efficient transmitters of the very information needed to increase overall prosperity . on this view , the market prices and profits obtaining under free competition are signals which transmit information that enables each part of the system to respond to the rest and to plan or to work out its own detailed activities . but the market as a whole is so complex that the details of its operation are not known to anyone . as one nobel prize winning economist puts it : ' the market , with each individual going his own way , with no central authority setting social priorities , avoiding duplication and co - ordinating activities . . . is a system which enables the dispersed knowledge and skill of millions of people to be co - ordinated for a common purpose . men in malaya who produce rubber , in mexico who produce graphite , in the state of washington who produce timber , and countless others , co - operate in the production of an ordinary rubber - tipped lead pencil . . . thought there is no world government to which they all submit , no common language in which they could converse , and no knowledge of or interest in the purpose for which they co - operate . ' ( 11 ) it is the insight that desirable economic consequences can flow from human actions that are not the result of human design , and the way that this insight has been developed by market economists since the days of adam smith , that led another nobel prize winning economist to write : ' we have never designed our economic system . we were not intelligent enough for that . . . but if anything is certain it is that no person who was not already familiar with the market could have designed the economic order which is capable of maintaining the present numbers of mankind . ' ( 12 ) all this is neglected or ignored by the activist political theologians . consequently they also fail to recognise that there are many other spheres of human activity in which individual human actions can lead to desirable co - operative consequences which are not necessarily planned or directly intended by the individuals themselves . examples include our development and use of natural languages to communicate with one another and to transmit our cultures ; the development of the vast body of scientific knowledge by the international scientific community ; and even the pluralistic structures - legal , political , social , economic , cultural and religious - of the open societies of the world which are sometimes characterised as liberal or democratic or capitalist . such unplanned co - operation can occur when similar conditions exist to those which enable market economies to function . what these conditions are can be seen more clearly if , following f.a. hayek , we consider a market economy as one example of a spontaneous order . such orders , in their totality , are so complex that no individual or small group could possibly know all the facts and details which are relevant to their functioning . consequently such orders typically evolve : they are not capable of being designed or planned . their central and necessary feature is that they have evolved decentralised mechanisms for the transmission of information thereby overcoming the limitations of individual knowledge . their operation usually requires the maintenance of a framework of rules and values , either tacit or explicit , whose essential purpose is to permit and facilitate the decentralised transmission of information , but these rules and values only define the structure of the spontaneous order : they do not determine the content of the transmitted information . and they do not rule out the use of deliberate design and detailed planning in small - scale situations in which it is possible to know all or most of the relevant facts . all these features - unknowable complexity , unplanned evolution , effective and decentralised information transmission , mutually accepted rules and values , small scale planning and decision - are common to natural languages , to the body of scientific knowledge held by the scientific community , to the diverse structures of open pluralist societies and to free economic markets whether local or national or international in scale . ( 13 ) it is also true that all these spontaneous orders have much greater scope or potential than structures which are based on deliberate planning or design . consider the richness and diversity of the literatures of the world compared with the precisely defined but limited attributes of a computer language . and it is inconceivable that anyone could have designed the scientific order which , over the last three centuries , has created the most significant and universal body of interlocking theoretical and empirical human knowledge yet achieved . there is a striking contrast with some 20 th century attempts to control science in , for example , the soviet union and national socialist germany . ( 14 ) there is also a great gulf between the achievements both cultural and economic , of the open societies of the first world , underpinned by their commitment to free speech and the free flow of information , and those of the centrally planned societies of the second world . there are profound reasons for these differences which are rooted in the humble recognition of our limitations as individual human beings . to presume to be able to know all the relevant facts needed to design complex social institutions is to suffer from what hayek calls the synoptic delusion . ( 15 ) and there is a deeper humility in the tentative attitude to scientific knowledge as expressed in the philosophy of karl popper . ( 16 ) for popper , as for most scientists , our current scientific knowledge is a provisional approximation to the truth , any part of which is always open to revision or rejection in the face of new evidence . this ethic pervades the activities of scientists who recognise its necessity if they are to succeed in knowing even a little about the complexities of the natural world . how much more necessary is it to adopt such an attitude in our attempts to understand the even more complex and plastic world of human institutions . one major problem in achieving such understanding may lie in the large scale of the structures we have described as spontaneous orders compared with those we have most direct experience of in our ordinary day - to - day lives . scientists faced a similar problem in attempting to come to terms with the new evidence revealed by the discovery of the microscope and the telescope in the 17 th century . for these new worlds of the very small and the very large , the old common sense was not enough . new concepts were needed before even provisional sense could be made of them and it was many decades before scientists could handle with confidence these new data so far removed from the everyday familiar world in which we spend most of our lives . similarly the instincts , responses and habits of mind that are appropriate and desirable in our daily lives , or even in the smaller scale and more localised communities of the past , may not be sure guides to our attempts to understand the complexities of the modern world . ( 16 ) and yet our survival may depend on our gaining at least some understanding , not of the detailed functioning of spontaneous orders , but of the conditions needed if such orders are to be maintained . this may be difficult , and it may involve unfamiliar methods of reasoning and painful reassessments of long - held views . but these are reasons for approaching the task with due humility , not for abandoning it or failing to attempt it . all these questions , unconsidered by activist political theologians , are ones which ought to be at least on the agenda of any serious student of the modern world . and this is true even for those who are agnostic , or even atheistic , in matters of religion and who are moved primarily by the secular ideals of the enlightenment with its twin emphases on human progress and on man 's ability to control both nature and his own destiny . let us also remember that the enlightenment identified social institutions as the main focus of evil in the world . this is true also of those like keynes who ' repudiated entirely customary morals , conventions and traditional wisdom ' ; who ' recognised no moral obligation , no inner sanction , to conform or obey ' ; who ' were , that is to say , in the strict sense of the term , immoralists . ' ( 17 ) but for christians , there are greater and more fundamental questions than these . unconsidered questions for christians christians need to consider the many moral , spiritual and theological insights which stem from their faith in addition to the intellectual , rational and emotional insights of those who view the world and the universe from secular or non - christian perspectives . ( 18 ) all these strands need to be woven together in the quest for a coherent christian world view . and one essential strand in that quest is a sense of history - a recognition that christianity has a past as well as a future and that , by its very nature , it is concerned with much more than local issues and the here and now . it is not just contributions from the christian tradition that are important . there are many other traditions , such as the greek , the roman and the judaic , that have interacted with christianity and helped to create the values and institutions of the open societies of the modern world which in turn have nurtured the basic political freedoms and freedom of religious belief . these traditions have one important common feature . they have all developed institutions and practices which helped to buttress the independence of individuals against the collective powers of their rulers . for example there is the respect for the intellectual freedoms and aesthetic judgments of individuals deriving from ancient greece , buttressed in the last resort by banishment to another city state ; the principle of the equality of individuals before the law , deriving from the principles of natural justice but codified and transmitted via roman law ; and the contributions of judaism to respect for individual property rights and the codification of commercial contracts between individuals . in christianity itself there is christ 's message concerning the salvation of the individual soul and the availability to each of god 's grace . then there is the christian emphasis on the conscience of each individual , and on his own interpretation of scripture , which is most marked in the protestant tradition but by no means confined to it . all these christian concerns with history and tradition , and with respect for the autonomy of the individual , are virtually ignored by activist political theologians . and they ignore too another major concern of the christian moral tradition - the doctrine of original sin . this doctrine is , and always has been , fundamental to christian moral teaching . the first recorded use of the word ' original ' in english is in this phrase . and once the primacy of original sin is understood , two consequences follow at once . the first is that the focus of evil in the world is not solely in social and political institutions but also in every one of us as individuals . so evil can be an attribute of both individual human beings and of the human institutions , societies and cultures that human beings create , use and live by . and this consequence is made even more plausible by the scale of the evil exhibited by individuals , by organised groups and by whole societies in the 20 th century , ( 19 ) the second consequence of the doctrine of original sin is that it should eliminate from consideration any claim that human institutions or societies are , or ever can be , perfectible . yet perfectibilist or utopian claims or assumptions underpin many of the destructive criticisms of existing societies made by activist political theologians . they rage against each example of injustice or oppression as if , in themselves , such examples constitute sufficient evidence totally to condemn such societies . they sometimes even call unjust or oppressive what many would not recognise as such . and they frequently suggest the possibility of creating a perfect society - which they call the kingdom of god here on earth - but without ever indicating the form such a society would take or how it would avoid some of the obvious pitfalls that have plagued political philosophers and rulers from the time of plato . to raise perfectibilist aspirations is easy . to do this , and at the same time deliberately to ignore the well - known problems in realising these aspirations , is wilfully to mislead a generation under the guise of giving them spiritual and moral guidance . it is defensible and sometimes even necessary for theologians to seek to modify or reinterpret christian doctrine in the light of new knowledge and experience . but it is surely not defensible for any theologian virtually to reverse christian doctrine on such central matters as respect for tradition , the nature of the individual person , and the sources of evil . nor is it defensible then to proceed as if such reversals were perfectly obvious and natural and cursorily to dismiss the arguments of those christians who take a different view . and this de facto refusal to take part in serious debate is even more indefensible when the doctrines in question have deep implications for the very social and political issues which so concern the activist political theologians . it is surely right that compassion for the poor should inform any christian social thinking ; but this should encompass respect for the human dignity of each individual - created in the image of god and bearer of an eternal soul . so our christian insights into the nature of each individual human being should reinforce the secular arguments for the rights of individuals against the powers of rulers and the modern state . because of our christian beliefs we should be more concerned than non - believers about the need for constraints on the exercise of power . this should lead us to take very seriously the traditional arguments concerning the checks and balances provided by the separation of powers between the judiciary , the executive and the legislature , and by institutions such as private property and the religious , civil and legal rights of individuals . these concerns should surely be reinforced by the formidable growth in the powers of all modern states in the 20 th century and , in particular , with the example before us of a state - the soviet union - which has systematically attempted to eradicate christianity , and all other religions too , from the minds and lives of its people . yet seven decades of atheistic propaganda , mass closure and destruction of churches , persecution and killing of bishops , priests and believers , and forbidding of the teaching of religion to children have failed to put these questions on the agenda of the activist political theologians . also missing from this agenda are perspectives which christian belief ought to bring to numerous other important questions . consider , for example , the relationship discussed above between the growth in the population of the world and the forces - modern science , technology and medicine - which have initiated and sustained growth . christians should surely seek to understand these forces not only because their loss would cause untold suffering but also because they have enabled many millions of individual souls to have the gift of life and of access to christ 's gospel . christians should also be bringing all their intellectual , moral and spiritual resources to bear on the problems first considered in depth by malthus in the 18 th century concerning the balance , both in the world as a whole and in individual countries , between rising numbers of individual souls and the quality of life of each individual . there are no easy answers to such questions . at the same time there is surely a distinctively christian response to those problems which acknowledges their complexity and which also recognises that in the real social and political world , just as in the physical world of the natural sciences , not everything is possible and that sometimes we need to balance one desirable objective against another . where lies the truth ? ' . . . comes the moment to decide , in the strife of truth with falsehood , for the good or evil side ; ' ( 20 ) being sure of even a part of the truth is never easy , even in the fairly predictable world of the natural sciences . this is even more true of knowledge about the more complex and less predictable world of the social and political sciences . what we can be sure of is the inadequacy of an approach , like that of the activist political theologians , which fails to use comparative analysis , that fundamental tool of the social sciences , and which fails to consider so many crucial questions . the gaps are so large , even by secular academic standards , as to cast doubt on almost all their analyses and prescriptions . if their approach to social and political problems is so crude , why should the activist political theologians be believed in their writings about the much more complex world of theology ? those who wish to take sides with the poor , in any part of the world , must surely learn not to ascribe their problems to one overiding cause . they must learn to look at problems of poverty and deprivation wherever they occur - in marxist societies just as much as in liberal or capitalist ones . they must learn to take seriously the workings of social and political processes , like the spontaneous orders described above , which by their nature can not be fully described or understood . after all , this is true , a fortiori , of all the endeavours of theologians down the ages , seeking as they do to describe and to capture the infinity of god and his created universe in the inadequate languages available to mere men , even when guided and inspired by the holy spirit . the task of the theologian is , at the same time , impossible to achieve and yet equally impossible to eschew . but so is the task of the christian in seeking how to understand and respond to the unprecedented challenges of the modern world . humility and a deep reverence for truth are needed for both tasks as is a love and compassion for our fellow human beings which does not shrink from firmly challenging those , both within and outside the church , with whom we fundamentally disagree on social , political and doctrinal matters . after all , it was christ himself who said : ' think not that i am come to send peace on earth : i came not to send peace but a sword . ' ( 21 ) it may be only thus that we can truly take sides with the poor and aspire to a real theology of liberation . in the words of the hymn : ' new occasions teach new duties ; time makes ancient good uncouth ; they must upward still and onward who would keep abreast of truth .

and how many more of us carelessly leave the cold tap on full blast for several minutes as we scrub away ? i appreciate it 's not an ideal topic to contemplate when you 're trying to enjoy your saturday morning croissants , dear readers , but in our household we 've experimented with those environmentally friendly devices that sit at the bottom of toilet cisterns to help reduce consumption . have you tried them ? and have you noticed , like me , that the flush is then so pathetically weak that three or four attempts are needed to do the job properly ? goodness knows how much of my life has been wasted , embarrassingly locked in the loo as i wait for that wretched tank to dribble full again for one determined , final flush . some years ago , i was a self - confessed , chronic water waster . late at night , under cover of darkness , i 'd sneak out and spend an hour in the garden of bullock towers with my hose . every flowerbed would be drenched , every terracotta pot filled to the brim , and every inch of lawn left sodden in my quest for horticultural perfection . washing and rinsing the bullockmobile to achieve an enviable shine would be another long and wasteful process . at the time our hefty water bills were based on the rateable value of our detached house , so there was method in my madness : we were simply getting what we 'd paid for . when julie suggested having a water meter instead , i was fearful of even higher bills and resisted the ' big brother ' scheme for as long as possible . the reality was very different , however - our costs were significantly reduced and the meter made us all more sensible and water - conscious . i 've stopped my nightly dousing sessions in the garden and the car does n't always have so much of a showroom sparkle nowadays . but who cares ? never have we been more water - conscious or frugal than on our recent week 's holiday in a touring caravan , staying on a couple of friendly sites in the midlands and the lake district run by the camping and caravanning club . we were borrowing the caravan and it was our first attempt at towing , a thoroughly enjoyable experience which i plan to describe in more detail in a future edp article . when i initially stepped inside the caravan , i spotted a golf trolley and was surprised that such luxurious sporting equipment should be provided . on closer inspection , the ' golf trolley ' was in fact a wheeled plastic container for collecting all our waste water . there was also a 40-litre barrel that had to be filled with fresh water from the site taps and rolled back to the caravan with a long metal handle . such fun ! what amazed me most was how rapidly the three of us got through 40 litres of water . a cup of tea here , a glass of squash there , a bowl of washing - up … and we 'd drained the barrel dry yet again . when it came to using the caravan 's shower , of course , the level dropped even faster . indeed , i rolled out the barrel so many times in my capacity as family water - carrier that every day felt like the dawning of the age of aquarius . just when i began to relax , the tiger woods - style waste collector would need emptying again . i wonder how we would cope if the water supply here at bullock towers consisted of nothing more than a 40-litre plastic barrel and a length of rubber hose . flushing those pesky toilets would only be one of our problems ._. _ _ usb devices � a prescription for disaster usb devices are commonly know as the ' swiss army knife ' of the hacker and if not secured can leave both sensitive information and computer systems vulnerable to attack . but how likely is it that any hacker will waste their time try to obtain your information and what would they do with it ?

the view from eef reforms to the apprentice system have been announced by dfes . but what does eef think ? what is proposed ? proposal 1 removal of the word “ modern ” from “ modern apprenticeships ” , changing foundation modern apprenticeship to apprenticeship , and advanced modern apprenticeship to advanced apprenticeship engineering employers have never been particularly concerned with the names and titles of the framework , but rather with its content and delivery . proposal 2 introduction of “ young apprenticeships ” for 14 - 16 year olds . giving young people the opportunity to access high - quality vocational learning is welcomed by employers . although a number of health and safety issues mean that under-16s will not be able to take part in many workshop activities , the opportunity to witness and experience the excitement of engineering and manufacturing before completing gcses will hopefully improve the supply of talented young people into our industry post-16 . the successful introduction of the gcse in engineering has shown that young people across the ability range welcome the chance to move outside the narrow academic world at 14 . proposal 3 introduction of a “ pre - apprenticeship ” offer based on “ entry into employment ” . we are concerned that the focus of the reforms on this level of applicant – one who is not yet capable of completing an apprenticeship – might send the wrong signal to those considering an advanced apprenticeship in engineering . the majority of engineering apprenticeships are at the advanced level , so attracting those well below the usual level of entry is of less importance to engineering employers , than ensuring enough applicants at the advanced level . proposal 4 scrapping the arbitrary 25 year age limit . we have long campaigned for a removal of the funding disincentive which focuses employers on young people aged 16 - 18 . those aged 19 - 24 and older currently receive significantly less / no funding , so removal of the age cap is very welcome . however , the proposals currently contain no details about how the funding will be managed . we presume the removal of the age limit will mean improved levels of funding for those over 25 , but at what level , is not made clear . ideally , we would need extra funding applied to the apprenticeship programme to support its expansion , rather than a re - allocation of existing funds . proposal 5 the learning and skills council to launch a major advertising and marketing campaign targeted at employers . in certain areas of the country , demand for engineering apprenticeships does indeed outstrip supply , with more young people wanting places than are available from employers . improving employer information about the benefits of offering apprenticeships will give those who are unsure of the value of taking part in the framework the chance to make an informed choice . proposal 6 giving employers , via the sector skills councils , a bigger role in the design , content and entry requirements of apprenticeships engineering and manufacturing employers have always been active in the developed of apprenticeship frameworks , through the work of eef and the sector skills council for the sector , semta . we are confident that our framework already meets the needs of employers , reflecting their demands for flexibility , breadth and depth of study , and balancing on- and off - the - job elements . proposal 7 develop greater “ portability ” arrangements so that an apprentice can take a part completed apprenticeship with them if they move employer . engineering advanced apprenticeships can take up to four years , a longer period than other apprenticeships . it is therefore sensible to ensure that young people and employers can be confident in the transferability of the various elements . proposal 8 create a “ clearing house ” for school leavers . eef already provides a service for engineering companies and prospective apprentices through its website www.apprentices.co.uk . we would expect any national initiative to work with us to develop the system for other sectors – we do not wish to compromise the quality of what is already working for engineering . proposal 9 work towards awarding “ accredited ” status for an apprenticeship . the current apprenticeship is not technically a “ qualification ” , but employers recognise it to be such . our concern with this proposal is that it would mean that awarding bodies ( such as edexcel ) would therefore award the apprenticeship , rather than the sector skills councils which currently control the frameworks . while semta for our sector has the advantage of a linked awarding body ( eal ) , other sectors might struggle to retain control of their frameworks . proposal 10 explore the development of credit - based qualifications to better meet the needs of employers as long as the quality of the overall apprenticeship system is not compromised , employers welcome the unitisation of qualifications , which enable them to tailor training frameworks to their business needs . proposal 11 review financial incentives for apprentices . apprentices in engineering are among the highest paid across all sectors , reflecting the level of study , commitment and achievement expected . we believe that the engineering apprenticeship does not suffer in comparison to other sectors’ apprenticeship salaries , nor in comparison to other jobs ( without training ) which young people might consider . proposal 12 consider financial incentives to encourage more smes to get on board . this is absolutely key to the success of apprenticeship expansion . in engineering , much of the first year involves off - the - job training at a college or group training provider , while the apprentice also expects a salary . employers are therefore paying a great deal “ up - front ” in training costs and salaries , but not receiving any return , as the apprentice is not “ on the floor ” . small firms in particular , can not afford this vast initial expenditure , so financial incentives to give small firms an initial boost would be extremely welcome . as long as the sector skills councils stay close to their employers , we can be confident that the needs of small firms are met by the apprenticeship frameworks . proposal 13 introduction of an 8 week probationary period while for engineering apprentices , this will not be quite so valuable as for those who find themselves in the workplace from day one , it will still give both apprentice and employer the opportunity to review their commitment to the programme . although the apprentice will most likely have spent the eight weeks in a training provider or at college , they will have a much clearer view of the demands and rewards of an engineering apprenticeship . there would be less need for probationary periods if all young people received better quality careers advice and guidance , which adequately prepared them for the requirements and expectations of an apprenticeship ._. _ _ visual foxpro programming for crystal reports : two days an in -

but all the same his slumber was not pleasant , for though his body was resting his brain was hard at work . before an hour had passed he was conscious of being cold , and in a dreamy way he felt that he ought to do what under the circumstances was impossible : that is to say , put more clothes over him , or , failing them , as he had no more , roll himself over and over in the blanket that he had brought strapped to his saddle - bow and only thrown over him when he lay down to sleep . but his body was so steeped in sleep that he did not stir , and suffered from the freezing air of the night -- so tremendous a change from the torrid heat of mid - day out on the veldt . later on , about midnight , the impression came upon him that he could hear a lion far away , seeming to make the earth quiver beneath him by giving forth in the fierce beast 's strangely ventriloquial way its awe - inspiring roar , so puzzling to the listener as to whether it is far off or near . and even in his dreamy state west found himself doubting that it could be a lion 's roar that he heard so near to where civilisation had driven off most of the savage beasts of the plain . but the roar came again , nearer , and in his dreams he felt sure that he was right , and he recalled , still sleeping , the fact that now and then the king of beasts followed one or other of the straggling herds of antelopes quite close to the boers ' farms . then the curious barking roar ceased , and with it consciousness for some time . all at once he found himself wide awake , lying upon his back , and gazing straight up through the transparent darkness at the stars . he lay for some moments wondering what had awakened him , perfectly still , and listening intently for steps or the trampling of horses , feeling sure that the boers were close at hand . instinctively his hand was reached out to grasp the rifle , which he had laid by his side and covered from the dew or hoar frost , whichever might come , by throwing over it part of his blanket . as he touched it the cold perspiration began to start from every pore , for there was a whiff of hot breath upon his face , and he could dimly see that some large animal was stretching down its muzzle towards him , and for a few brief moments he lay as if paralysed , expecting to feel himself seized and dragged away , for now came back with keen clearness the recollection of having heard the distant roaring of a lion . he had hardly grasped this when once more , from somewhere near , the lion 's terrifying cry arose , evidently , as he thought in a flash , one of the companions of the huge beast at his side . in an instant now he had grasped the truth , for as the distant lion roared there came from his right the peculiar stumbling movement of one of the hobbled horses striving to get closer to where there would be human companionship , if not protection . " poor beast ! " thought west , as his fascinated eyes stared at the dim shape above him , so close that it shut out from him the light of the stars . then the half - paralysed listener saw clearly , for the beast raised its head and uttered a low whinnying cry , which was answered from the direction where the other hobbled pony was moving . " woho , my boy ! " whispered west , with the blood now tingling through his veins , and as the pony whinnied softly again west raised himself up with his rifle in his right hand and stretched out his left for it to come in contact with the soft warm muzzle of his pony , which pressed against it , the poor brute uttering a low sigh . quite a minute then passed , the two ponies remaining motionless , and west listening with every nerve on the strain , knowing as he did that a lion must be in very close proximity , and fully expecting every moment that there might be a tremendous bound and the savage brute would alight either upon him or upon one of the poor shivering beasts . then , from evidently pretty close at hand , there was a low muttering growl , the barrel of west 's rifle fell into his left hand as he held the weapon pistol - wise and fired low down in the direction of the sounds . at the flash and in company with the report there was a yelping snarl and a couple of angry roars in quick succession . west fired again as nearly as he could judge where the beast would be , and the next moment ingleborough was kneeling by his side . " what is it -- lions ? " he panted . " yes , " whispered west , whose fingers were busy re - loading , and he listened for the next sound , but only to hear a deep sighing breath on either side , telling that the horses had been too much terrified to start away , or else felt that they would be safer with their masters , and that to try to gallop off meant the springing of a savage enemy upon their backs . the silence continued for nearly a minute , and then there was a vicious snarling , apparently some fifty yards away , while without a moment 's hesitation ingleborough raised his rifle to his shoulder and fired as nearly as he could judge at the spot from whence the noise came . he fired twice , the shots being so close together as almost to be like one for a while . then after a perceptible interval they were echoed from the walls of a distant kopje , and again from another , before they died away . " that has startled the lions , " said ingleborough ; " but i 'm afraid it will startle the boers and bring them to see what 's the matter . " " yes , the lions are gone , " said west . " hark at that ! who says horses have no sense ? " for the crop , crop , crop of the browsing animals had begun again from close at hand , and the comrades stood listening for some little time while the otherwise unbroken stillness once more reigned . " what 's to be done ? " said west . " shall we make a start at once , or wait for daylight ? " " i was thinking , " replied ingleborough . " if we start now we have the advantage of the darkness to hide us , but the disadvantage too , for we may go blundering right into the midst of some commando . i do n't think the firing could do us any harm , after all , for the enemy would not be able to tell where the sounds came from . i think we had better stay where we are and wait for morning . " " i think so too , " said west , with a sigh of relief ; " but one of us ought to watch in case the lions come back . " " they will not come back ! " said ingleborough decisively . " from what i know of their habits they 'll have been too much scared to risk their lives again . you hit one of them ; there 's no doubt about that . " " you think there was more than one ? " " i should say it was a family party of an old lioness and two or three half - grown cubs . " " then we may lie down and sleep again ? " " yes ; we must trust to our luck , noll ; there 's a good deal of chance in these affairs . " west hesitated for a few minutes , and then followed his companion 's example , lying awake for some time thinking of what a strange change this was from his quiet life in the offices of the company ; and then , as he began to ponder over what might be to come , the subject grew too difficult for him and he fell fast asleep . but he was the first to awaken in the grey dawn , to find that the horses were close at hand , browsing away contentedly enough , and ready to neigh softly and submit to his caress when he walked up to them ; while , as soon as he had satisfied himself that they had not suffered in any way , he walked in the direction in which he had fired during the night , to find footprints in several directions , and in one place the dust among some stones torn up and scattered , as if one of the brutes had fallen on its side and scratched up the earth . plainer still in the way of proof of what had happened , there were spots and smudges of blood , giving thorough evidence that one of the lions had been wounded by the chance shot , and had fallen , and struggled fiercely to regain its feet . he had just arrived at this conclusion when ingleborough found him . " hallo ! " cried his companion ; " that was a good blind shot , noll . well done , lad ! a full - grown lion too ! look at its pads . it must have had a nasty flesh - wound to have bled like this . " " do you think it 'll be lying anywhere near , half - dead , or quite ? " " no ! a cat has nine lives , they say ; and really this kind of beast is very , hard to kill . look , there are the pugs , along with those of three more , all half - grown , going right away yonder into the open veldt . we might hunt 'em down , but we do n't want to , eh ? " " absurd ! we want to get on at once . can you see any pug , as you call it , of boers ? " " no . i 've had a good look round , and as soon as we 've had a mouthful we 'll be off . i say , it 's wonderful , is n't it , how one can sleep out here on the veldt ? " " surrounded by dangers ! " replied west . then laconically : " yes . " their scanty meal was soon eaten and washed down with a draught of pure water , after which they both climbed to the top of the highest part of the kopje to take a good survey of the surrounding plain . " there 's nothing in sight , " said ingleborough quietly ; " so we 'll hurry on at once while our shoes are good . " the ponies looked as fresh as ever when they were saddled and ready to start , and after an examination of the compass ingleborough pointed out that they ought to keep along north - east to strike the vaal somewhere that evening , and then go along its southern bank till a ford was reached , after which their journey would be north by west . " but we must be on the look - out for some lonely farm to - day , " said west . " we ought to well fill our haversacks before we start again . " " never fear ; we shall find plenty of food for sale so long as we have money to show the boer ladies . ready ? " " yes , " replied west , and together they sprang into their saddles and rode down the slope , their horses carefully picking their way among the stones , till the open veldt was reached . they then struck off at a quiet canter towards a rocky ridge so as to put that between them and the kopje where they had slept , in case by any possibility their shots had been heard and a party of the enemy should ride up to it to make a search and in the course of it see them in the distance riding away . " and that would mean pursuit , a race , and the fastest horses to win , " said west . " as they generally do when there is fair play , " replied ingleborough quietly . " keep a sharp look - out forward , and i 'll keep on casting an eye back at the kopje . " the ridge was only about a couple of miles distant from their previous night 's resting - place , proving to be fairly high , but with a gradual slope : while just as they reached the spot where the ascent began ingleborough turned in his saddle from a long look - out backwards . " this is like wringing one 's own neck , " he cried . " now then , let 's canter up this bit , and as soon as we have topped it we need not be so cautious . ready ? " " yes , " cried west . " then off ! steady ! no galloping ; a gentle canter . " it was fortunate for the pair that they did not breathe their horses , but rode up the gentle slope at a regular lady 's canter , to find the ridge pleasantly fringed with a patch of open woodland , through which their steeds easily picked their way , and on to the farther slope , which was more dotted with forest growth ; but there was nothing to hinder their rate of speed -- in fact , the horses began to increase the pace as a broad grassy stretch opened before them . the moment they passed out of the woodland on to the open space west uttered a word of warning and pressed his pony 's side , for the first glance showed him that they had come right upon a boer laager which was in the course of being broken up . oxen were being in - spanned , men were tightening the girths of their ponies , and preparations were in progress everywhere for an advance in some direction . | next chapter | | previous chapter | | contents | e - books created from nineteenth century or early twentieth century texts by athelstane e - texts ._. _ _ antara koh pte ltd v. eng tou offshore pte ltd singapore high court : belinda ang saw ean j : [ 2005 ] sghc 166 : 5 september 2005 ts oon & bazul and just law llc for antara koh ang & partners for eng tou limitation : section 136 of the merchant shipping act : whether loss occurred without actual fault or privity of owner summary a crane that was on the barge " antara koh b8 " collapsed and fell on the tug " tambat " . six of the crew members and the crane operator perished in the casualty . the owners of the " antara koh b8 " , antara koh pte ltd ( " antara koh " ) commenced a limitation action for a declaration that their liability was limited to a certain quantum pursuant to the singapore merchant shipping act . the only party contesting the limitation action was eng tou offshore pte ltd ( " eng tou " ) , the owners of the tug . the issue was whether the loss had occurred with or without the actual fault or privity of antara koh . a further issue was whether antara koh had proved its pleaded case that the cause of the loss was due to the negligence of the crane operator . dmc rating category : c onfirmed this case note was contributed by ang & partners , the website 's international contributors for singapore facts the tug " tambat " was chartered to tow the " antara koh b8 " to sungei johor to retrieve an anchor and anchor chain lying on the river bed . mounted on " antara koh b8 " was a crane . in the process of lifting the recovered anchor , the boom of the crane on the " antara koh b8 " collapsed and fell on the " tambat " . the tug sank . six of the crew members and the crane operator perished in the casualty . eng tou as owners of the " tambat " sued antara koh . antara koh 's defence got struck out and eng tou entered default judgment against antara koh , with damages to be assessed . the assessment of damages was , however , ordered to be stayed , pending the determination of the limitation action commenced by antara koh . in the limitation action , the question was whether antara koh 's liability could be limited pursuant to section 136 of the merchant shipping act 1 . judgment ( 1 ) the legal consequence of the default judgment was that antara koh was liable entirely for the casualty . the question was what was the cause of the casualty . eng tou , as owners of the " tambat " , asserted that the loss occurred with the actual fault or privity of antara koh in that there was inadequate welding of the boom connectors at the bottom boom insert of the crane . antara koh blamed the negligence of the crane operator and argued that this constituted " any other act or omission of any person on board the ship " within the meaning of section 136(1)(d ) of the merchant shipping act . ( 2 ) the onus was on antara koh to establish that eng tou 's loss was not caused by antara koh 's " actual fault or privity " . the court found that the crane operator was an experienced one . the court also accepted eng tou 's expert 's opinion that when the crane boom suddenly swung to port , it was indicative of the crane operator having lost control of the crane rather than inadvertence on his part . ( 3 ) it was agreed that there was inadequate welding of the boom . eng tou 's expert opined that this was due to poor workmanship . antara koh 's expert did not provide any satisfactory challenge of this opinion . antara koh however had not pleaded this as a cause of the casualty entitling them to invoke limit . the court thus found that antara koh had not established its pleaded case on this point . the court further found that , if so pleaded , the use of a defective crane was improper management of equipment necessary for the barge 's operational purpose as a crane barge and , therefore , was within the meaning of section 136(1)(d ) . ( 4 ) whilst the above finding would have been sufficient to dispose of the limitation action , the court also proceeded to rule that the use of the defective crane and the consequent damage had occurred with the actual fault or privity of antara koh . the court examined the conduct of koh , as the director who carried out the functions of management and spoke and acted as the company . there was no system of checks to ensure that management 's directions relating to crane maintenance were carried out . koh was found to be at fault in failing to institute a proper system to ensure that the duties of the plant manager delegated to the site engineer were performed . koh 's omission contributed to the occurrence of the loss . koh 's fault was attributable to the company . antara koh was therefore not entitled to a limitation decree . comment this case is probably the last case where a shipowner ( yet again ) failed to limit its liability under the old provisions of the merchant shipping act , when singapore was still bound by the 1957 international convention relating to the limitation of the liability of owners of sea - going ships . the convention on limitation of liability for maritime claims , 1976 , with higher limits but that are more difficult to break , came into force in singapore on 1 may 2005 . shipowners should find it easier to limit liability under the new regime . 1 back to top these case notes have been prepared with care , but neither the editor nor the international and other contributors can guarantee that they are free from error , nor that they contain every pertinent point . reliance should not therefore be placed upon them without independent verification . the editor and the international and other contributors disclaim all liability for any loss of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising as a result of others acting or refraining from acting in reliance on the contents of this website and the information to which it gives access . the editor claims copyright in the content of the website ._. _ _ back by popular demand , following the success of last year 's dvd , update have produced a second in the series which will be available in september 2006 . the dvd will again consist of 3 hours of presentations , but this year one disc will concentrate on legal topics and the other disc on management / regulatory topics . the dvd will include discussions points prepared by each of the presenters , which can be used by those viewing to follow up with an hour long group discussion of the points raised . this would then allow for as much as 4 hours cpd -- some management . the topics to be covered in the 2006 dvd include : conveyancing -- latest developments trusts / executries and wills -- what 's new and common problems family law -- latest update risk management incidental financial business good client care and dealing with complaints the dvd forms part of update 's flexible learning programme and as such can obviously be viewed in short bursts , if that suits you better ( the rules of a minimum of 3 in the group still apply though ) . the dvd is perfect for local faculty cpd programmes , firms to show in house and even groups of sole practitioners to get together locally and view -- all at a time of your own choosing and no travelling involved . comments for those who viewed last years dvd include " good idea -- flexible , easy viewing , please provide more " " a huge time saving initiative and at affordable price , well done update " the dvd comes complete with inlay card , indexed presentations , instructions for viewing via your computer and downloadable copies of all presentations . the dvd is fully dda compliant . the dvd will cost just � 109 plus vat ( � 128.08 ) -- great value flexible learning at an affordable price . to order a copy of the dvd please access related files to the right . details concerning the 2005 dvd_nn _ _ economic policy -

" begum has set up her own project " yam " ( which means climbing tree ) to raise awareness about domestic violence and how it affects women from south asian countries . women can not access protection from the police and judicial system . when they claim asylum and in the uk they are faced with a culture of disbelief and frequently refused asylum because the home office ignore it 's own guidance on gender . begum was to speak about these issues at a special meeting for refugee week in canterbury with lucy wake from amnesty international 's stop violence against women campaign . her story was also featured in " women for refugee women " an event organised in may by the guardian journalist natasha walter to campaigning to ensure that the uk government takes seriously asylum claims by women who have been subject to gender persecution . begum 's campaign has the support of her mp gwyn prosser . yesterday gwyn prosser sought an urgent meeting with the immigration minister liam byrne to ask for her case to be reviewed on compassionate grounds . he has written to begum at yarl 's wood and this letter was read out at a vigil outside the town hall in dover attended by more than 50 people , called with only few hours ' notice . begum also has the support of the mp diane abbott . begum 's mental health has suffered due the trauma of sexual violation and the anxiety about forced removal . at yarl 's wood and if deported to india she can not access psychiatric support and her rape crisis counselling . she is currently deeply distressed and friends are concerned that she may self - harm rather than be deported . her psychiatrist dr malasi has always maintained that detention places begum at risk of self - harm and suicide . the immigration authorities are aware of this and dr malasi will be faxing gwen prosser to make this point again . what you can do to help friends of begum have put together a model letter , below , that you can copy / amend / write your own version and fax to the minister of state for nationality , citizenship and immigration liam byrne mp . requesting that begum should be released from detention and the removal stayed . fax : 020 7219 2417 from outside the uk + 44 20 7219 2417 liam byrne minister for immigration 3rd floor peel building 2 marsham street london sw1p 4df please notify the campaign of any faxes sent : begum must stay campaign c/0 kent campaign to defend asylum seekers kadams314@hotmail.com http://www.ncadc.org.uk/ letter liam byrne immigration minister the home office 3rd floor peel building 2 marsham street london sw1p 4df dear mr byrne re begum , home office ref h1096253 i am asking you to show compassion for begum an indian rape survivor who has been refused asylum and was taken to yarl 's wood removal centre after reporting to her local immigration centre . begum faces deportation to india on saturday june 17th at 9.45 am . begum is terrified that her abusive ex husband who is the editor of a strongly islamic newspaper will find her and kill her if she is returned . therefore she does not wish to reveal her identity . begum came to the uk more than three years ago fleeing her male cousin whom she was forced to marry after he violated her as a result of a family feud . begum 's cousin divorced her almost immediately disputing her dowry . he then waged a campaign of harassment against her and her family . begum 's father died in suspicious circumstances and her mother died subsequently . after receiving death threats from her ex husband begum withdrew from a civil action against him that her father had initiated . begum was refused asylum because the home office say the domestic violence she suffered does not amount to persecution and that she can safely relocate to another city . however as a lone woman it would be very hard for her to find security . begum is currently receiving psychiatric support and rape crisis counselling . evidence from amnesty international 's south india team indicates that that this will be difficult to continue , � a rape victim if she is poor has no assured access of quality psychiatric and social support . additionally , � government - owned and ngo - run shelters are available but can not provide permanent relief- the victim will have to support herself . scores of victims are doing it but it puts them at further risk . � begum 's supporters are very worried about her detention at yarl 's wood . her psychiatrist dr malasi says � i feel incarceration in a detention centre can only aggravate her depression and worsen her condition . if this happens she will be at risk of self harm and suicide . � begum recently graduated on a human rights course advocacy course for refugees and asylum seekers campaigning for women like herself who have been violated . everyone in her community is very proud of her . i appeal to you to release begum from detention and allow her to remain in the uk ._. _ _ on getting it home - we found the back opened quite easily . no catch , just tight fitting - and pulling on the ring opened it . we also discovered that the ring operated a bar which moved the film from one cassette to the other and also operated the film counter . we were very fortunate in finding 2 very nice agfa karat cassettes in the camera as well as the one in the case . some of the other features took a little bit more time to figure out . focusing is by the lever on the bottom - which also operates the coupled rangefinder . the rangefinder appears to no longer work - and there is no focus scale so this now really is by guess work ! the body mounted shutter release also was n't obvious and hung loose for a few days until we figured out how to fit it into place . also as well as the rangefinder window , the camera appears to have 2 viewfinders . this i think is to allow both eyes to frame the view - like binoculars . other than the lens and shutter which are factory made - the rest of the camera seems handmade out of mainly brass . workmanship is very good but lacks the consistency and smoothness that factory made equipment has . the rangefinder mechanism may well contain parts from another camera as the prisms / mirrors would be quite hard to produce . inside back showing agfa karat cassettes . camera closed for storage . note lens does not fold away . inside of back door showing film transport mechanism . this is operated by a pull / push action on the rod connected to the ring on the left . this ring is also used to open the door for film loading . bottom of camera showing frame counter , focus lever and rangefinder mechanism . initially i thought the lens / shutter had certainly been taken from another camera . whilst pentac lenses were certainly sold surplus after wwii - these tended to have much longer focal lengths - whilst this one was obviously for a fairly small negative format . additionally the gamax no . 2 shutter was of the simplest type and not suitable for military use . however i then stumbled across the following advert from � the miscellaneous trading co. ltd � . this advert is from � the amateur photographer � , dated february 23 , 1938 - but the same advert appeared for several weeks : there is a very good chance this camera 's lens / shutter is one of the 100 or so mentioned here . the date of 1938 would tie in well with the use of agfa karat cassettes . alternatively its possible that these 100 lenses were the remains of a much longer production run and the lens / shutter was stripped from camera originally fitted with this combination . whilst this camera takes ordinary 35 mm film strip - as the cassettes are non standard its a little bit more effort to use . it should be easy enough to reload the karat cassettes in a darkroom - but i 'd have to do my own film processing as finding somebody to process from the karat cassettes might be difficult . as a work around i have done some tests using polariod i - zone film which i 've loaded into the camera with the help of a changing bag . click here for the complete procedure for doing this . the pictures below are some of the test results so far : these pictures are scanned directly from the i - zone prints at 300dpi using our flatbed scanner . they have been cropped , adjusted for contrast , dust / mark spotted and mirrored - but otherwise unchanged . value wise - this is a difficult camera to judge . i 've certainly had a lot of fun loading i - zone film into it and figuring out exposure and focus . with all the bits which came with it - its worth at least the � 15 we paid for it and as its probably a unique camera as a addition to the collection its been worthwhile . i 'd be very happy to hear anybody 's comments / questions on this camera and if anybody can shed any light on its history or design then i 'd be very grateful . got a question or ca n't find the info you are looking for ? click_vb _ _ the job of the energiser is to convert power ( from the mains , battery or light ( solar ) ) to pulses and push them down the electric fence line . the pulses are of high voltage and low amperage , which makes them , like static electricity , safe but an unpleasant experience . we have a whole range of energisers to power electric fences . the difference between energisers is in their pushing power and energy , i.e. how far can they push the pulse and at the same time maintain their voltage . a rough guide to determine which is the right energiser for the appropriate electric fence:- ( length of fence x the number of lines of tape / rope / wire ) x 1.5 + ( add more for planned future expansion ) . a stronger energiser should always be used to contain or exclude animals which are carnivorous ( e.g. fox ) or are well insulated ( e.g. sheep , badgers & rabbits ) . similarly , it is advisable to choose a stronger energiser for powering electric netting as the netting live lines will always touch vegetation , which causes earthing and power loss . we have devised all our kits so they will easily cope with the number of lines or nets required and also allows for future expansion . warranty : our aim is to offer a value for money solution by supplying good quality and reliable products at the right price . note : all our energisers have a two -

modal research a draft discussion paper presented at ifip conferencemanchester , july 2002 by keri facer , head of learning research , futurelab problematising language as a research tool the analysis of the images alongside the text , however , also raised some questions about the role of different modalities in structuring the meanings produced by children in the research setting . one example should suffice to clarify this problematic . another 9 year - old boy from a rural primary school had written ' i think computers are good , you can find things out and do homework ' . his picture , however , showed a boy playing on a computer game , with a smile on his face and the words ' goal ' ' goal ' writ large above the computer screen . as has been argued elsewhere ( kress and van leeuwen 1996 ; christensen and james , 2000 ) drawing is not associated by young people with ' work ' , as writing is , and is seen to be immune to the assessment mechanisms usually imposed within the school setting on writing . drawing , then , could be considered to be a modality associated with out of school practices rather than academic and assessed work . how , then , should we interpret these two apparently conflicting responses from the same child , one of which privileges a school - based activity , the other privileging a playful leisure activity ? what is the status of the ' data ' that we encounter here ? if the boy had written ' i think computers are good , you can find things out and do homework and they are fun to play games on ' we might simply argue that the child saw multiple uses for the computer , multiple uses that reflect the convergence of entertainment , work and informational resources within one technology . however , because the meanings communicated in text and image are so starkly different , we need to ask whether the mode of communication of the response in itself served to structure likely responses . in other words , did the request for an image encourage the child to adopt the conventions of drawing as a pleasurable , out of school activity and accordingly to encourage the production of an image of pleasurable out of school activity ? reciprocally , does the use of writing , even when about out of school activities , encourage a focus by children on school - related , assessable activities when reporting their interests ? having adopted a multi - modal approach , it becomes essential to reflect not only on the ' content ' of the response , in other words , focusing on interpreting what the drawings and writing mean , but also on the ways in which the different modalities may structure what it is even possible for the respondent to communicate . as kress ( et al ) argue , the different modalities of communicative action offer different potentials for meaning , offer different affordances to the user . the introduction of a second modality into the questionnaire , then , does not simply expand the range of meanings elicited from the respondent , it may fundamentally destabilise the security for researchers of relying on one modality alone ( written language ) by drawing attention to the ways in which this mode may structure the respondents ' sense of what is conventionally communicated through writing and drawing . meanings in context early on in the project we had drawn upon work in the field of media studies , in particular ethnographies of everyday media use , to theorise the role of the visual and spatial organisation of the home in constructing meanings for technologies in these settings . the work of silverstone , hirsch and morley , in particular , emphasised a need to recognise the ways in which the ' objectification ' of technologies such as televisions and computers served to both articulate and construct meanings ( and hence uses ) for technologies within the domestic environment ( see silverstone & hirsch , 1992 ; morley , 1992 ; marvin , 1988 ) . this resulted in the use of two specific research techniques within the project - the provision of cameras to the case study children and the attention to the three - dimensional space and movement within it , of the domestic environments that we were researching . both of these approaches again demonstrate different challenges and potentials in the attempt to widen research to a multi - modal approach . children as photographers all the case study children in the project were provided with single use cameras with flashes to document their own and their families ' use of computers in the home . the children were briefed in a written document and again through conversation with the researchers to focus on taking photographs of : 1 . the computers and games consoles around the home 2 . people using the computer in the home 3 . computers and people using them at school 4 . the home in general 5 . other things , people or places that were important to them the children were working within these constraints and within the constraints of a camera that allowed at most 36 photographs to be taken . when the photographs were taken the children returned the cameras to the researchers who developed the film and , where requested , produced copies for the families themselves . the aims of this research technique were to 1 ) gather data that the researchers would not have been able to gather for themselves , and 2 ) allow the research subjects to represent ( within the above guidelines ) the activities and objects that were of significance to them . on a more theoretical level , it was felt that this approach would allow the researchers to explore how the technologies in the home were objectified as representations of the values within the household , and , through examining the processes of selection of photographs by the children , to explore how these technologies ' fitted into ' the other activities , interests and areas of the children 's lives . this dual purpose immediately raises questions of interest to the multi - modal researcher , namely , what is the status of these photographs as ' data ' ? how are choices made in the transformation of reality into photograph ? in particular , it raises questions about working with research participants as researchers to give access to otherwise inaccessible ' aspects of reality ' . in recent years these questions have been addressed by researchers in the social sciences who have used ' autophotography ' as a means of exploring research participants ' ' self - concept ' , and of exploring gender and nationality differences in social relations . work in these areas immediately problematises the notion that we can consider the photographs taken by these children as anything other than representations of reality , representations that , moreover , may be shaped by age , gender , ethnicity and self - esteem ( ziller , 1990 ; ziller , 1985 ; emmison & smith , 2001 ) . clancy and dollinger in their 1993 study of sex - role differences , for example , identified that women were more likely than men to take photographs which showed themselves smiling at the camera and interacting with other people . by contrast , men 's photographs more frequently showed themselves alone , and represented more frequently leisure activities and pictures of ' prize possessions ' ( clancy and dollinger , 1993 ) . similarly , photography is culturally associated in many households with the documentation of important events , of holidays - it serves as a material ' memory ' held in albums and in photo frames . given these socio - cultural traditions and differences in relations with the mode of photography , what role can the data from these photographs serve ? how do we make sense , for example , of the 10 year - old twin girls whose 36 photographs included two of them using the computer alone , one using a playstation with friends and approximately 20 of their new ( twin ) kittens ? or of the 9 year - old girl who took no photographs of the technology , and many of the countryside surrounding her house and the animals , barns and buildings that made up her farm ? or of the 10 year - old boy who took no photos of his computer , many of his playstation and even more of his family 's new year holiday to belgium ? it would be easy to dismiss these sequences of photographs as a case of the children ' failing to understand the instructions ' as researchers , to argue that the photography in this case did not provide the ' real ' researchers with access to the data they needed - ie of the objects of technology in use . alternatively , we might argue that these sequences of photographs themselves begin to provide interesting research data . that the process of selection of images begins to convey where the children in question place the priorities in their lives and the extent to which the technology plays a major role in these or not . given the research in visual sociology , however , we would have to be cautious about the extent to which we individualised our readings of these sequences of photographs , and would need to examine the complex relationships between individual selection of images and structural relationships between children of different genders ( and possibly ethnicities and ages ) with the mode of photography in general . we do n't have space here to present the full range of images produced by even one of the case studies , but the following examples from the twins , nick and james , discussed earlier , should provide an insight into how the children 's processes of selection serve to emphasise both their priorities and interests , and their relations with technology in the home . the following images are all representative of at least two others in their selection ._. _ _ dumfries and galloway council has recently completed a major restructuring programme that has changed our decision -

" workers and their interests much has been said to obscure the issues involved in the strikes and to denigrate the workers and their trade union leaders . what is certain is that the workers must take a stand in defence of their own interests , while at the same time becoming conscious of the necessity to end their marginalisation from political affairs and getting organised to do just that . in this respect , it is not a return to the 1970s which is threatened or which is needed , for the world crisis has deepened since that time , and the interests of the whole society demand that workers take the lead in turning things around . especially since the reactionary turn of events since september 11 , building the workers � opposition to the neo - liberal agenda has become the order of the day , and no question facing the workers can be sorted out unless this is taken up . article index workers ' movement consignia could become another railtrack there are fears that consignia could turn into another railtrack . the national audit office says opening up the postal system to competitors may not be enough to improve services to customers . it says consignia 's strength could be enough to discourage competitors even though present delivery targets were not being met . the report says firms could be reluctant to enter the market , especially if they were only given short - term licences . the nao has also warned that on the other hand that if consignia does lose custom to its competitors it may find it difficult to maintain a universal postal service at current prices or service levels . consignia said competition was already building up and the organisation recognised that a tough market would inevitably get tougher . should not , therefore , the postal service be run to meet society � s needs rather than be based on competing in the global market ? article index ambulance crews vote to demand reinstatement paramedics on merseyside have voted to go on strike unless two of their colleagues are reinstated . the ambulance service union ( asu ) says 87 % of its members voted in favour of strike action following the suspension of two paramedics . the asu represents 160 of the 190 paramedics in the liverpool and sefton area , which has about 500,000 residents . ambulance stations affected by any action are southport , maghull , old swan , formby , fazakerley , toxteth , crosby , kirkby , south liverpool , bootle and anfield . mersey regional ambulance nhs trust said it was disappointed by the proposed action by the asu . a trust spokesman said : " we are disappointed members of the ambulance service union have voted in favour of strike action . " the two paramedics were suspended from work for " gross misconduct " after , they claim , one of them felt ill and they contacted control to say they had finished their shift . union area secretary mark brooks said there would be a disciplinary hearing with the two men on friday , january 25 . if they are reinstated , the strike will be called off . in early january 2002 , a meeting of union members passed a unanimous vote of no confidence in the senior operational management of the trust 's northern area . article index unions criticise 3.5 % pay rise for teachers teaching unions have criticised the 3.5 % proposed pay rise for teachers as inadequate to end a recruitment crisis facing schools . in the pay deal , starting salaries will rise to � 17,628 from � 17,000 while more experienced teachers will get � 25,746 within five years , up from � 24,843 . national union of teachers general secretary doug mcavoy said : " sadly , the increase of only 3.5 % for all teachers is still well below the growth in average earnings . even with the shortened scale , the additional cost will be around 4 % , well below the increase in average earnings and below the increase for doctors and nurses . " nigel de gruchy , general secretary of the national association of schoolmasters union of women teachers , the second largest teaching union , called the deal a " mixed bag " . david hart , general secretary of the national association of head teachers , said he was " remarkably underwhelmed " by the deal . " i do think the government is being dangerously complacent if it thinks this is going to turn around the recruitment and retention crisis and not only attract people into the profession , but stop the exodus we are suffering from at the present time . " education secretary estelle morris also announced a radical shake - up of the performance - related pay system ( prp ) , saying teachers in england and wales would be eligible to apply for � 2,148 bonuses after five years instead of the current seven from september . article index iraq sanctions debate at cambridge union society : british government accused of crimes against humanity a debate took place last night , january 24 , at the cambridge union society on the theme : " this house would lift sanctions on iraq " . a panel of guest speakers representing a broad range of concerned public opinion from the spheres of diplomacy , law , finance and economics , argued against the retention of the present sanctions regime on iraq and expressed alarm at the policies being pursued by the israeli authorities . sir harold walker , former british ambassador to iraq , called for changes in the sanctions regime that would end the suffering inflicted upon the iraqi people ; for example , less than half of them now have access to potable water . he pointed out that iraq had been " a second world country not a third world country " before the sanctions were imposed , and that this contradicted claims that no benefits would flow to the ordinary people of iraq if sanctions were lifted . he warned of the dangers arising from the " evident double standards " of policy towards iraq and the israelis . colin rowatt , economist of birmingham university , likewise argued that the sanctions should not target civilians but should instead target the iraqi military . he called for a " reconfigured " sanctions regime in which iraqi oil revenues would still be held in an escrow account as at present but that civilian and military expenditure would be " delinked " more effectively so as to allow gains from trade . this view was endorsed by tony gammon , the bank of england official responsible for monitory financial aspects of the sanctions , who was critical of the fact that " the same package of sanctions has remained for ten years " , leading to a situation where the system is not achieving its aims and should be changed . speaking in favour of the lifting of sanctions was hugh stephens , organiser of the activities in britain of the international commission of inquiry on economic sanctions , whose co - presidents include ramsey clark , former attorney general of the us . in his speech to the debate , hugh stephens accused prime ministers margaret thatcher , john major and tony blair , and their foreign ministers , representatives at the united nations , and other relevant representatives responsible for the continuing economic sanctions against iraq , of crimes against humanity , and crimes under the genocide convention . he also accused them of the violation of international humanitarian norms as expounded in the geneva convention and the nuremberg principles , and other fundamental documents of international law and norms , as interpreted in this connection by former us attorney general ramsey clark in his criminal complaint issued november 14 , 1996 , and related documents . these persons named and unnamed , the speaker said , have knowingly inflicted deprivation , hunger and suffering on a massive scale leading to the deaths of more than a million iraqi people , the majority being infants and children under five years of age . they have done so by the deliberate deprivation of the entire iraqi population of supplies essential to life and health , with full knowledge of the consequences of their actions constantly communicated to them by the relevant organisations duly accredited for that purpose by the united nations . they have engaged in a course of conduct calculated to prevent a relaxation of tension and solution to the problems of the middle eastern region , including continuing criminal bombing raids on iraq and the sabotage of attempts by neighbouring countries to re - establish a peaceful security order in their region . these persons have engaged in the knowing and reckless destruction of the entire fabric of international law painstakingly constructed since the end of the second world war to prevent precisely such aggressive and genocidal behaviour by major powers , including bringing into disrepute the security council of the united nations and other bodies central to sustaining world peace and security . the speaker called on all decent people in this country to fulfil their obligations to take action to bring these crimes committed in our name before the court of public opinion , to demand that the sanctions against iraq be lifted immediately , that those responsible for these crimes be brought to justice , and that reparations be made by the offending powers so far as may be possible to compensate the people of that country for the immeasurable suffering inflicted upon them . lord david hannay , a senior diplomatic figure and former british ambassador to the united nations , summed up the debate . he agreed with the other speakers that the sanctions had made the iraqi people suffer , had not achieved their objective , and should be better targeted . he also said that the policies of the israeli authorities are " misguided , wrong , and must be changed " . article index cuba : our disagreement is not about fighting terrorism , but about the methods used to fight terrorism excerpt from a press interview given by general ra � l castro ruz , minister of the revolutionary armed forces ( far ) of cuba , to the national and foreign press on saturday , january 19 , at the loma malones observation point , guant � namo , after the conclusion of the rally in a nearby municipality . parts of the interview were broadcast live by us television network abc and it was summarised by foreign news agencies . ( from the translation of the transcript of the council of state ) vivian sequera ( ap ) : in the recent statement by your government regarding what is happening at guant � namo naval base , cuba � s offer of support and medical aid is mentioned . has there been any response from washington ? ra � l castro : i don � t know of any reply received during the days i � ve been here in the eastern provinces , or very recently ... but i don � t think there has been one yet . as is only natural , the proposal is being studied , the process is beginning , the prisoners are now arriving . some 110 have now arrived . referring to what the cuban government offered in the statement : eliminating vectors and pests , medical aid , although they � re putting up a 4th - level hospital , and other services . above all , the united states has a large number of logistical personnel and military police there . in other words , the needs will become clear in the future . in 1994 , we established minimum co - operation links to deal with problems that sprang up . in the situation created in 1994 , people were constantly wanting to come and go and we had to establish co - operation ; both sides realised that . both governments authorised a group of themes limited to the base and its perimeters , taking relevant measures to avoid accidents : out if this arose what used to be called a hot line � a telephone used for that type of activity � and it has proved very useful for , in reality , since the triumph of the revolution until 1994 , we had 35 years of a rather complicated and tense atmosphere along the 32-kilometer border , with some moments more tense than others . there came a moment when we moved back from our posts � not from the fence , but from out posts , in order to avoid incidents ... because they would open fire on our posts . there was large amount of rotation of us personnel and the degree of relations and the complexity of our relations was manifested here . it was very complicated , and it was my responsibility to come and talk here . every time a comrade died , i was designated to come to guant � namo and talk to a multitude of incensed people , explaining to them what happened . later he referred to the last serious provocation at the base , explaining : we went on december 7 , 1989 , to mark the transfer of the remains of our comrades who died in angola . together with comrade fidel , we were holding the main ceremony in cacahual [ near havana ] � and at the same moment there were funeral rites in 167 of the island � s 169 municipalities for all those who died . it was a day of tremendous pain for the people , and in what was considered the main ceremony , which was very symbolic because it took place where the remains of general antonio maceo are buried . at that very moment , a shot was fired at two soldiers were standing at their post . one called to the other to tell him something , and as he turned his face a sniper � s bullet entered the post , breaking the glass . you have to imagine what this meant , coming at a moment when the whole country was in mourning and paying tribute to its dead who were being simultaneously buried , with their families and people watching . because we didn � t bring the remains of the bodies here , all the families were informed that all would return together when we fulfilled the mission in angola and other places where smaller numbers of cubans died . that was the moment when the attack took place . i don � t know how the people of caimanera found out right away and someone was sent to speak to them . the attack really was one of the stupidest and most dangerous acts of provocation . in 1994 , the events concerning the cuban and haitian rafters created a situation that obliged us to co - operate . since then , there has been absolute calm here , appreciated by both countries . about two years ago the united states finished withdrawing the tanks they kept here . we , without coming to any agreement , made the gesture of withdrawing our tanks from the frontline border to deeper positions . a year and a half later , we withdrew all the heavy artillery we kept in tunnels and different locations aimed at the base . and we even moved the mortar positions back . all that is left here are rifles and some anti - air missiles ( that are not emplaced ) . currently there is an atmosphere of co - operation , of mutual respect and collaboration . i want to emphasise that our disagreements in this situation are not about fighting terrorism but about the methods used to fight terrorism . referring to the question you asked me , we are willing � as our government � s note states � to engage in any kind of co - operation . one day , while talking with a retired us general about the positive atmosphere that has been created , i joked , " we are soldiers , we have a duty to the civil authority , to our governments . if our governments order us to bring out the cannons , we must obey orders . " i went on , " until the order comes , let � s have civilised relations . " and he understood that . naturally , the situation is not acceptable to the animals in miami , the folks at the [ cuban american national ] foundation and the worst elements of what was the republic before the revolution triumphed in january 1959 . through our government , the united states has informed us that it would bring prisoners and reinforcements to guard them . up until today [ saturday , january 19 ] , 110 prisoners have arrived and between 1,000 to 1,100 reinforcements , mostly military police and logistical personnel . according to a public statement i read by brigadier general lehnert , who heads the joint task force no . 160 , their mission is to guard the prisoners . that same general , when he was a colonel , was also commander of a joint task force in 1995 when the rafters were here . according to us authorities � statements , they will follow all the norms established by the international red cross regarding the treatment of prisoners and have invited that organisation to come to the base . they have declared that the necessary reinforcements do not imply any danger or threat to the zone � s stability . we believe them ; we understand that it is logical , if a specific number of prisoners are to be brought to the base � over which , as we � ve already said here we have no jurisdiction � then they have to bring in personnel , more or less the number mentioned . as the january 11 note from our government stated , we are not thinking of increasing our troops around the base � s perimeter , because it � s not necessary , because there � s no tension , as i said . but there is more work , which is why i decided to appoint a second chief of the border brigade . you are all here now and journalists are constantly coming here so we must carry out other activities . and lieutenant colonel victoria arr � e has been appointed to the post . lieutenant colonel victoria arr � e is currently the president of the association of veterans of the cuban revolution in guant � namo and she is the only member of that organisation , with the exception of major of the revolution almeida , who is authorised to wear olive green fatigues , because she is on active duty . he asked her to head that organisation in the province about two and a half years ago , and we let her go , on the condition that she would have to return at some point , and this is the moment . i signed the order today , january 19 , so now the brigade leader has three seconds - in - command and one of them must go to the academy soon . speaking of comrade arr � e , she began with voluntary military service , which is how women join the armed forces . she then passed a course to become head of a company , then of the infantry , then of a battalion , and then of anti - aircraft defence . she went to angola and headed the anti - aircraft artillery unit in lubango , formerly sa da bandeira , in south - western angola . another female regiment , which was from havana , went to the new cahama airport , during the final stages of the offensive against the south africans . subsequently , she gradually increased her level of responsibility , until she led an anti - aircraft artillery regiment of women here in the city of guant � namo . she then entered the far academy for the regular two - year course and specialised in anti - aircraft defence . she later went on to the national defence school in havana and returned as second head of the political section of an infantry division and now , from the veterans association , she is moving on to being second - in - command of the brigade . she is the only reinforcement we have brought here , because there is no tension , but there is a lot of work . article index stop the war coalition stop israel � s war on palestine protest saturday , january 26 , 2002 : assemble 12 noon , queen � s gate , kensington gore , london sw7 , opposite the royal albert hall . tube : south kensington or high street kensington rally and march to israeli embassy , high street kensington , london w8_nn _ _ we are sorry we can not find the page you requested . the page you are looking for is either no longer available or it has moved . we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you . if you are having trouble locating a destination on ciao , please try visiting the ciao home page or browse through our extended category list . you may also find what you are looking for by using our search box above ._. _ _ read about new zealanders in london australians like to travel : 5 % of the country 's population of 20 million are living overseas at any one time , and 20 % of that diaspora is in london . many come for work and stay for a few years , but many other put down permanent roots . within london , the sixties australian enclaves of london around earl 's court are gradually spreading out across the capital -

" the national archives give a good summary of how to start searching for a particular convict ancestor . by the 1850s transportation was abandoned , and many willing migrants went to australia to escape poverty or find greater chances for advancement in a younger , less classridden society . in the 1850s many went to australia in response to the gold rush - hence the use of " digger " to describe australians . captain cook paintings and drawings from the voyages of captain cook are held at the natural history museum . these images are by white artists of things and people they were seeing for the first time , including a kangaroo , described by an early visitor as " ... an animal as large as a greyhound , of a mouse colour and very swift .

case study of pro - israel bias : children 's bbc website bbc 's childrens website cbbc has " ready to use lessons - plans " on the middle - east conflict for teachers to print out and use in the classroom , the traget audience being 11 - 14 year olds . we dissect each lesson page by page to reveal their pro - israel bias . we suggest this case study of pro - israel bias in a leading " educational " website be used to form the basis of a lesson on media bias to be taught at schools , and madressa 's , and by parents to their children at home . the best way to teach your children about the pro - zionist bias around them is to show them an example , one which they can understand and relate to because it targets them . khiam prison - israels torture den khiam prison was a detention and interrogation camp during the years of the israeli occupation in southern lebanon . from 1985 until the israeli defeat in may 2000 , thousands of lebanese men , women and even children were held in khiam without trial . most were brutally tortured - some died . the photo - article is quiet graphic at times but it must be read . ali kashmar was imprisoned for 10 yrs , starting as a child aged 14 : " it 's really hard to summarise all that period [ of imprisonment ] in seconds . but i tell you something - when you die you die in a second but in that prison you died a hundred times every day . " it is important to understand what happened at khiam as it is the only israeli torture den that has been liberated , from seeing what went on there we can understand what goes on in the countless other " detention and interrogation " centres that we do not have access to . next time you hear of a palestinian being held in detention think of khiam . the jews of iraq by naeim giladi after the palestinians were uprooted from their land , foreign jews came to populate the confiscated land . among then , came over half a million jews from islamic lands . zionist propagandists claim that israel " rescued " these jews from their anti - jewish muslim neighbours . one of those " rescued " jews - naeim giladi - knows otherwise . he describes how the zionists terrorized the jews in muslim lands in to emigrating to israel . in his own words : " i write this article to tell the american people , and especially american jews , that jews from islamic lands did not emigrate willingly to israel ; that , to force them to leave , jews killed jews ... " this article shatters the zionist lie that jews were evicted from muslim lands because of anti - semitism and provides evidence that the zionists were happy to " manufacture " anti - semitism to the extent of murdering fellow jews in order to further the interests of the zionist state . teach - in : audio lectures eye - witness to sabra - shatila massacre a moving eye - witness account of the massacres of sabra - shatila by dr ang swee chai . " the slaughter of unarmed children , women , the aged and the infirm was shocking . for me , i was doubly outraged that i had to discover the truth about a brave and generous people only through their deaths . until then , i never knew palestinian refugees existed . as a fundamentalist christian , i had been a supporter of israel , hated arabs and saw the palestinian liberation organisation as terrorists to be loathed and feared .

century science . the book – 21 years in the preparation – represented the first attempt to write an all - encompassing theory that accounted for the development of life on earth . in suggesting that life - forms evolve through the generations , darwin outraged the victorian church , which held to a more or less literal interpretation of the story of creation given in the old testament . the theories of evolution and the survival of the fittest have hardly been questioned by scientists in the 150 years since darwin ’s findings were first aired , making this one of the most spectacular forward leaps in scientific history . biography darwin 's work was a summary of all the most important findings in the field of evolution . let us introduce you to some of his predecessors , and give you a flavour of the religious controversy that followed its first publication biography features join us as we re -

of - hand , ' many are conscious at each new disclosure of a diminution in the ardour of their pleasure . i must therefore warn that well - known character , the general reader , that i am here embarked upon a most distasteful business : taking down the picture from the wall and looking on the back ; and , like the inquiring child , pulling the musical cart to pieces . 1 . choice of words .-- the art of literature stands apart from among its sisters , because the material in which the literary artist works is the dialect of life ; hence , on the one hand , a strange freshness and immediacy of address to the public mind , which is ready prepared to understand it ; but hence , on the other , a singular limitation . the sister arts enjoy the use of a plastic and ductile material , like the modeller 's clay ; literature alone is condemned to work in mosaic with finite and quite rigid words . you have seen these blocks , dear to the nursery : this one a pillar , that a pediment , a third a window or a vase . it is with blocks of just such arbitrary size and figure that the literary architect is condemned to design the palace of his art . nor is this all ; for since these blocks , or words , are the acknowledged currency of our daily affairs , there are here possible none of those suppressions by which other arts obtain relief , continuity , and vigour : no hieroglyphic touch , no smoothed impasto , no inscrutable shadow , as in painting ; no blank wall , as in architecture ; but every word , phrase , sentence , and paragraph must move in a logical progression , and convey a definite conventional import . now the first merit which attracts in the pages of a good writer , or the talk of a brilliant conversationalist , is the apt choice and contrast of the words employed . it is , indeed , a strange art to take these blocks , rudely conceived for the purpose of the market or the bar , and by tact of application touch them to the finest meanings and distinctions , restore to them their primal energy , wittily shift them to another issue , or make of them a drum to rouse the passions . but though this form of merit is without doubt the most sensible and seizing , it is far from being equally present in all writers . the effect of words in shakespeare , their singular justice , significance , and poetic charm , is different , indeed , from the effect of words in addison or fielding . essays in the art of writing page 02 robert louis stevenson free books in the public domain from the classic literature library �_nnp _ _ a multidisciplinary journal devoted to research on the cultures , societies , and history of the lusophone world . latest issue volume 22:1 ( march 2006 ) is now published . the contents listing , with links to the full text , are available online here . this volume is the inaugural issue of a new series of portuguese studies produced by a new editorial team and supported by an editorial board . volume 22 and subsequent volumes will appear in two parts each year , and each issue will include a balance of articles in english and in portuguese , with occasional thematic issues and a regular space for rare of otherwise unavailable archival documents . format each annual volume includes articles , reviews , literary translation , and a survey of research recently completed at universities in the united kingdom . no correspondence is published in portuguese studies , nor are advertisements carried . scope scholarly contributions are invited on all subjects within the fields of the literature , culture , and history of portugal , brazil and the portuguese -

no , i mean you absolutely can not fail ! success is guaranteed . dare to dream . the results of dreaming are so exciting that they motivate you as nothing else can . not only that , but the truly amazing thing is that , if you can imagine it , you can make it happen . that 's how man landed on the moon . kennedy did n't say , ' now , i wonder if we can get to the moon ? ' he said : ' i want to land men on the moon by the end of the decade . ' having given people this goal , he let other people run with it . today we all know neil armstrong 's famous words as he walked out onto the moon : ' one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . ' but make your dreams big , really big . if you write them down , and then work out what you need to do to get you from here to there , your chances of success increase exponentially . 2 . reconsider your objectives ultimately , do you want to build an empire ? do you want to sell your business for a fortune ? or do you just want a comfortable living with not too much effort ? whatever you want in the future will determine what you should be doing now . if you want to grow an empire , you will be going for steady growth , hiring for the long - term , investing in the right kinds of equipment , websites , marketing and so on . but if you want to sell out , your aim will be to slash costs , dramatically increase profits , improve your balance sheet , and plan how to avoid donating all your hard - earned money to the taxman . on the other hand , you may want a quiet life with a few customers . in this case , you will want to think about systematizing aspects of your business so you can achieve more in less time , and maybe outsourcing non - core work , such as book - keeping . 3 . cut your bills when did you last assess how much it costs you to do something ? could you do it for less ? set up a procedure so that every six months you systematically get quotes from other suppliers . even if you do n't change suppliers , you could be in a stronger position to negotiate a better deal from your current ones . and those utility bills ! have you switched suppliers for the best deal in terms of cost and service ? the resource has a whole section devoted to cost - reduction . check it out now . 4 . become more charismatic when meeting new people , one of the dullest introductions in the world is your job title . ' hello , i 'm a solicitor ' or ' i 'm the marketing manager for bloggs and co. ' such introductions are guaranteed to glaze eyes . but i know of one person who says : ' hello , i help people acquire wealth and pass it on to their children intact . ' now here is a person most people in a room will want to talk to . actually , he 's a financial adviser . how can you be as charismatic ? simple . stop thinking in terms of your job , and simply describe the benefit you provide . it takes time to perfect but is well worth the effort . start with : ' i help ... ' and go on from there . 5 . attend a networking meeting many people find it awkward to attend meetings where they do n't know anyone because , well , it 's tough walking up to complete strangers and engaging them in conversation . however , i met someone at a business club who changed the way i thought . he 'd march up to the biggest group of people , break into the circle and say : ' hello . i 'm christopher jones , ' thrusting his hand out to the nearest person , which they would automatically shake giving their own name in response : ' hi . i 'm laura williams . ' at this point he would reply : ' what do you do , laura ? ' and , of course , the ice was broken . the trick , i realized , is not to worry about interrupting other conversations in mid - flow , and to do this with great confidence , no matter how shaky you are on the inside . tip - most people will admire you for your courage . of course , it helps if you have worked out a really good introductory line in advance for when they inevitably ask , ' and what do you do ? ' 6 . set up an event staging an event , giving a talk or putting on a seminar on your pet subject are great ways to find prospects and boost your credibility . it worked for dee brain . when she opened a shop selling designer dresses , she did n't have any money to spend on advertising . so she contacted the local cancer research campaign office and offered to put on a fashion show for them . they were thrilled . they worked on their contacts and got a lot of publicity for the show . they also had a gigantic address list of likely donors whom they invited to the show . the show was a sell out and a great success ; the charity kept all the ticket money and dee sold her clothes and had launched her shop memorably . this technique works just as well for people offering advice . a financial adviser could put on a talk about the latest tax breaks available for people nearing retirement . an accountant could run a seminar on debt collection techniques . 7 . write an article for your trade press consultant nick rampley - sturgeon found that raising your profile is not as difficult as it might seem . work out who your target audience is . ' if you are a household decorator , ' says nick , ' you know who your clients tend to be . if you are a consultant , be very clear about who pays for your services . are they corporates , family businesses or public sector bodies ? ' there are thousands of editors of magazines , trade journals , company and club newsletters , and websites who all need content . work out what media your target audience reads and what they want to read about , and then approach relevant editors with a suggestion for an article . titles that go down well begin the secrets of ... a beginner 's guide to ... how to ... see the pr and the marketing sections in the solution centre of this site for many more ideas on how to raise your profile and generate a stream of hot prospects . 8 . improve your search engine rating if you have a website , do a search for your site on the search engines . unless you are ranked first , you have some work ahead of you to improve your ratings . there are ways and means of doing this . if you are not an expert , ask for some advice . check out the directory for people like you to help you . 9 . conduct a survey if you sell baths , how many baths per household do people have in your town , how often do they bath , how deep do they run them and what else do they do in them , apart from bath ? if you conduct a survey , even stopping people outside the local supermarket with a quick questionnaire , you will generate some fascinating statistics . you then send a press release to the relevant press - in this case , the local paper and radio and tv stations - announcing your findings . when this is published , you will be perceived as the bath expert . and if you want to generate enquires , you might create a free tip sheet on the secrets of buying a good bath , which you also note in that press release . when the details of how to get hold of the tip sheet are published along with your statistics , you have yourself some free advertising . if the tip sheet has a good enough title to entice people to pick up the phone to request a copy , you have a ready - made hot prospect list ! 10 . write a letter to the editor write a letter to the editor of the local paper , a trade magazine or even a national daily . they will generally publish your name , address and relevant details at the end . this raises your profile as an expert , and can generate sales leads . what can you write about ? search for articles that you agree or disagree with or can add to . then there is a clever formula to writing your letter . you start with a reference to the name and date of the article you are responding to . then present your comment using the formula : ' as an expert on ... , i ... ' for instance : ' as a expert on environmental disasters , i would like to defend ship owners ...

so now i work closer to home and travel by train ( where i can read a good book ) , or by bike ( where i can enjoy the journey for its own sake and get fit into the bargain ) . but i am still a petrolhead under the lycra . i love the look and sound of big , highly tuned engines . and the only thing i have against bmws is that when you drive one , people think you are a bmw driver ..._: _ _ hi !

" unfortunately , the person who told me this could n't remember why it was so . posted by blue witch on 12 june , 2006 at 6:49 am and look , others use it incorretly too : only they are even more incorrect as their percentiles add up to 100 . posted by blue witch on 12 june , 2006 at 6:52 am yes , i 'd like to see an answer to this one too ... i remember querying it a few years ago in relation to our youngest 's height . a very strange way of expressing data if you ask me . posted by nic on 12 june , 2006 at 8:21 am well , statistics was never my strong point ( pure and applied maths was more my style so what follows should be caveated ) , but i do n't understand why it ca n't be used that way . properly used , it is a tool for describing the distribution of values of elements in a set ( where the number of elements is 100 ) . it means that , if you are in the xth percentile , then x% of everyone else in the group scored the same or less than you . by default , that means that 100-x% scored higher . what it does n't tell you is anything else about the distribution . the people below you could all have scored vastly less than you or they could be very close to your score . ditto for the people above . as a tool , it only becomes useful if you can compare the scores at various percentile points ; then it would give you some idea of the distribuition curve . posted by dave on 12 june , 2006 at 10:00 am dave - yes , that 's how i 've always used it , and the ' by default ' would seem to be logically correct . but , apparently , according to the person i was talking to , and the fact that the web definitions all only refer to the part of the distribution below a given point , there appears to be more to it ... posted by blue witch on 12 june , 2006 at 10:19 am bw-- dave is right with his comments . however , the person who told you this initially is also right , although it might be considered a small or technical difference . you wrote that this professor said to you that you ca n't calculate the number of people above a certain percentile ( if that 's all you 're given ) . that 's correct . to do so you would also need the total number of participants . you would simply calculate the percentage above your percentile ( 100 minus percentile ) then divide by 100 then multiply by the total number of participants . btw , your example would give 70 ( not 69 ) . posted by mr. la pergrina on 12 june , 2006 at 4:51 pm ah yes , the old percentile conundrum . apparently it 's all to do with a world glut of kittens distorting the balance of nature . " the pth percentile of n ordered values is obtained by first calculating the rank k = p(n+1)/100 , rounded to the nearest integer and then taking the value that corresponds to that rank " . a lot of percentiles are not right as a result . a similar thing happened last year with quarrytiles . they kept falling off the wall . best not to fret over this bw - i fixed it with araldite . posted by drd on 12 june , 2006 at 4:57 pm ah , poor wording on my part mr lap - when i said ' number of people ' i meant percentile numbers - as per the penultimate paragraph . ( ie " while it is correct to say that a score at the 30th % ile means that 30 out of 100 people of a particular age would score at or below that level , it is not correct to go on to say that 69 out of 100 would score at better than this level .

[ 78074 ] mr. lammy : the table shows the change in the number of static public libraries in england , grouped into bands by opening hours , over the last five years and , for context , the comparable figures for 1997 - 98 . the same information for each of the 149 library authorities in england can be found in the public library statistics published by the chartered institute 19 jun 2006 : column 1609w of public finance and accountancy . copies are held in the house of commons library ._. _ _ many companies have used the call centre as a solution for a particular business unit . the department could set up a direct telephone service with little involvement from the it department . these call centres have transformed the way in which companies have done business and have typically paid for themselves many times over - either through cost savings or through the increased service they have been able to provide to their customers . however , many companies have woken up to the fact that they now have three , four , five , ten or even thirty call centres across the company or constituent business units . the call centres may vary in function from customer contact centres to smaller , perhaps informal help desks . while all of these centres may be offering a service to their customers , the level of service offered may vary considerably across the group and may also be accompanied by variations in the cost per call . these companies are now looking optimising these call centres . this may be in the form of rationalisation , achieving efficiency savings or consolidation . optimum size so why consolidate call centres at all ? the answer lies in the fact that many smaller call centres are less efficient than larger call centres . because of the random nature of incoming calls it is always necessary to over - staff the centre to provide the level of service and the time to answer that the customers demand . in a small centre the level of over - staffing , as a percentage , is typically very high . the larger the centre the better the overall efficiency . when a number of sites are taken into consideration the combined level of inefficiency becomes quite noticeable . the smaller centres , while offering good levels of customer relationship , also suffer from very variable service levels , particularly at busy times of the day . service levels can be inconsistent across different countries . this is becoming a particular problem for companies trying to support their multi - national customers . i recently did some work recently for a major computer manufacturer . one of their largest customers in the uk had recently acquired a smaller business in eastern europe . while the customer received great support from the uk call centre , their eastern european business arm received poor call centre service . their customer wanted a consistently high level of service across europe . in this case a pan - european call centre was proposed to meet service targets , rather than for cost saving reasons . very large call centres can become inefficient . above 300 agents management issues become a problem . the call centre adopts the feel of a voice factory with a correspondingly high agent churn rate . in europe , personal experience has shown that the optimum size of a call centre is typically between 150 to 350 agents . the pan - european call centre multi - national companies have typically grown on a country by country basis . this has commonly resulted in an autonomous call centre in every country , which has suited the needs of the local market , but has produced problems of its own when viewed at a group level . the relatively small number of agents in every country is inefficient , provides variable service levels between different countries , and there are difficulties in providing out - of - hours coverage . the case for looking at some form of call centre consolidation is strong . in terms of consolidation there are number of major models that could be considered . � one pan - european centre . in this model all calls are routed to one central location where all calls can be handled in their native language . with all calls routed to one location , the call centre it is more likely to have reached the critical mass for an efficient centre . � regional hubs . the approach of a pan - european centre is taken , but on a much smaller scale . for example , a nordic centre could cover all of the scandinavian countries . � product centres . similar to the pan - european model , but here each major product line has its own centre . this will typically be located next to a development centre , where third level support is available . � major and minor markets . typically the result of existing operations where larger countries , for example uk , germany and france have their own centres . the other countries have not yet reached this critical mass and one call centre serves the smaller countries . � country centres . a different call centre is kept in every country . networking techniques enable the sites to be linked together to form a larger pool of agents . � follow the sun . this is where call centre consolidation has been tackled on a global basis and a number of worldwide centres have been chosen . typically three main locations based in europe , america and asia the centres are open during normal business hours . the centres being in different time zones are able to provide 24-hour service by routing calls to the appropriate location . which option is the best ? this depends upon a number of factors specific to the business . a fundamental driver is whether enough calls can be concentrated into the call centre to enable it to reach critical mass . the in - country centre is often kept in place because although there may be significant benefits from consolidation the internal politics , particularly from strong country managers , tend to work against consolidation . networking of call centres one of the easiest forms of call centre consolidation is to simply network sites together . this enables calls to be passed to an available agent irrespective of where they are located . the main benefit of this is that it helps to fill in the peaks and troughs in call volumes received at individual sites . key meeting service levels just below service levels poor service levels figure 1 : networking helps to smooth out the peaks and troughs across the day . figure 1 shows the call volumes for a typical banking application . it can be seen that manchester can not comfortably deal with its call volume whereas in glasgow the service levels are consistently high and have spare capacity to deal with calls from other sites . if the three sites were networked together there could be an overall improvement in the service levels ( time to answer ) in addition to a lower number of agents required to meet the service level . in this case , the saving in the number of agents at any one time can be in the region of 7 agents , but by the time the 24 hour shift patterns are taken into account this worked out to be 18 full time equivalent agents . the savings could be in the region of � 300,000 per year . the main advantage of networking is that it enables a larger pool of agents to be available to answer calls , without incurring the restructuring costs to consolidate sites . networking does , however , fail to address the underlying problems of call centre inefficiency , and in many ways can exacerbate them . call centre managers are often reluctant to face up to the problems of accepting calls from other sites . efficiency savings on one site can often be swallowed up by calls overflowing from a less efficient site . unless senior management tackles these problems the underlying efficiency can still be left in place . business case in order to carry out any form of call centre consolidation a solid business case is needed . the impact of consolidation can have strategic implications for the company , as well as significant restructuring issues and costs . the business case can often be compelling . the potential savings and improvements in service should be significant , but building the case is not an easy task . the main barriers to the business case include : - � being able to clearly demonstrate the savings or improvements in customer service � convincing management that the savings are achievable � political infighting between the call centre and business managers � not reaching a critical mass of call volumes in the consolidated centre many organisations have found that observation techniques to gather empirical performance data , coupled with the use of external consultants for an objective appraisal of the situation have been expedient to getting the business case approved . call centre observation can produce the much - needed underlying data to support the business case . an evidence - based business case has a greater likelihood of success . it is easy to say the call handling process can be improved by 10 % . it is much more difficult to justify to senior management without base information . the use of internal benchmarking between sites can be used to help prove what could happen if internal best in class processes were adopted . summary the case for call centre consolidation is often compelling . it can help to improve service levels and consistency of service , while at the same time reducing cost . the impact in terms of restructuring of the organisation and the technology required , need to be carefully considered . call centre consolidation typically fails as a result of the lack of a clear and convincing business case and board - level backing . it is at this point where consolidation succeeds or fails and careers paths are enhanced or dashed ._. _ _ i hain't been a - near your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it to you . " the duke says : " have you seen anybody else go in there ? " " no , your grace , not as i remember , i believe . " " stop and think . " i studied awhile and see my chance ; then i says : " well , i see the niggers go in there several times . " both of them gave a little jump , and looked like they had n't ever expected it , and then like they had . then the duke says : " what , all of them ? " " no -- leastways , not all at once -- that is , i do n't think i ever see them all come out at once but just one time . " " hello ! when was that ? " " it was the day we had the funeral . in the morn- ing . it warn't early , because i overslept . i was just starting down the ladder , and i see them . " " well , go on , go on ! what did they do ? how 'd they act ? " " they did n't do nothing . and they did n't act anyway much , as fur as i see . they tiptoed away ; so i seen , easy enough , that they 'd shoved in there to do up your majesty 's room , or something , s'posing you was up ; and found you warn't up , and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up , if they had n't already waked you up . " " great guns , this is a go ! " says the king ; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly . they stood there a - thinking and scratching their heads a minute , and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle , and says : " it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand . they let on to be sorry they was going out of this region ! and i believed they was sorry , and so did you , and so did everybody . do n't ever tell me any more that a nigger ai n't got any histrionic talent . why , the way they played that thing it would fool anybody . in my opinion , there 's a fortune in 'em . if i had capital and a theater , i would n't want a better lay - out than that -- and here we 've gone and sold 'em for a song . yes , and ai n't privileged to sing the song yet . say , where is that song -- that draft ? " " in the bank for to be collected . where would it be ? " " well , that 's all right then , thank goodness . " says i , kind of timid - like : " is something gone wrong ? " the king whirls on me and rips out : " none o ' your business ! you keep your head shet , and mind y'r own affairs -- if you got any . long as you 're in this town do n't you forgit that -- you hear ? " then he says to the duke , " we got to jest swaller it and say noth'n ' : mum 's the word for us . " as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again , and says : " quick sales and small profits ! it 's a good busi- ness -- yes . " the king snarls around on him and says : " i was trying to do for the best in sellin ' 'em out so quick . if the profits has turned out to be none , lackin ' considable , and none to carry , is it my fault any more'n it 's yourn ? " " well , they'd be in this house yet and we wouldn't if i could a got my advice listened to . " the king sassed back as much as was safe for him , and then swapped around and lit into me again . he give me down the banks for not coming and telling him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that way -- said any fool would a knowed something was up . and then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile , and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning , and he 'd be blamed if he 'd ever do it again . so they went off a - jawing ; and i felt dreadful glad i 'd worked it all off on to the niggers , and yet had n't done the niggers no harm by it . chapter xxviii . by and by it was getting - up time . so i come down the ladder and started for down - stairs ; but as i come to the girls ' room the door was open , and i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk , which was open and she 'd been packing things in it -- getting ready to go to england . but she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap , and had her face in her hands , crying . i felt awful bad to see it ; of course anybody would . i went in there and says : " miss mary jane , you ca n't a -

ordinated effort to prevent its growth . it also stated that it is incumbent upon every institution to examine their policies and practices to guide against disadvantaging any section of our communities . the race relations ( amendment ) act 2000 was one of the responses of the government to the 70 recommendations of the inquiry report and marked the turning point in the development of race relations in modern britain . the race relations ( amendment ) act 2000 strengthens the 1976 act in two major ways : it extends protection against racial discrimination by public authorities it places a new , enforceable positive duty on public authorities the report clearly sets out the following recommendations : the need to tackle institutional racism in a wide range of organisations , and not simply in the police service the stephen lawrence inquiry report defines institutional racism as : " the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to the people because of their colour , culture , or ethnic origin . it can be seen or detected in processes , attitudes and behaviour , which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice , ignorance , thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people . " the act also places a general duty on public authorities to work towards the elimination of unlawful discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups the general duty means the duty in section 71 ( 1 ) of the race relations act 1976 , which is : to eliminate unlawful discrimination to promote equality of opportunity to promote good race relations between persons of different racial group . the duty aims to make race equality a central part of the way public authorities work by putting it at the centre of policy making , service delivery , regulation and enforcement , and employment practice . the act also introduced specific duties to help public authorities meet their general duty � to promote race equality . the home secretary also issued an order under the act , which sets out specific duties in policymaking , service delivery and employment . the specific duties serve as means to an end ; they are , for example , steps , methods , or arrangements , not an end in themselves . so meeting the general duty is the ultimate objective . under the specific duties � there are : specific duties ( policy and service delivery ) public authorities must state functions and policies they have assessed and prioritised as being relevant to the general duty of promoting race equality . they are to set out their arrangements for more detailed assessment of their prioritised functions , which will involve arrangements for : monitoring their policies for any adverse impact on race equality assessing and consulting on the likely impact of proposed policies publishing the results of their assessments , consultations and monitoring making sure that the public has access to information and services training their staff on the general duty back to top specific duties ( employment ) the council must monitor existing staff applicants for jobs promotion and training , by racial group all authorities with more than 150 full - time staff are also required to monitor and analyse by racial groups : grievances disciplinary action performance appraisal ( when they lead to benefits or penalties ) training staff leaving the authority in summary , the race relations ( amendment ) act 2000 places a general duty of promoting race equality on all public authorities . an action plan for the fulfilment of this general duty has to be prepared and published as a race equality scheme by 31 may 2002 . what is a race equality scheme ? a race equality scheme is a strategy or an action plan , which will summarise the authority 's approach to race equality . back to top what is the reason for the race equality scheme ? the reason for this scheme is to help public authorities evaluate their general duty to promote race equality at a corporate level . producing a race equality scheme will help authorities to consider the effects of all their activities and operations in terms of race equality , and to make the necessary changes to deliver their services effectively in a multi - ethnic society . public authorities will only be able to deal with the problem of institutional racism ( as defined in the stephen lawrence inquiry report ) if they put the promotion of race equality at the centre of their policy - making and service delivery . why is it important ? the government has said that an organisation that is promoting race equality will be recognised by the fact that it : monitors its workforce , and makes sure that people from ethnic minorities are treated fairly assesses how its policies and programmes could affect ethnic minorities , and deals with any possible adverse impact monitors the way in which its policies and programmes are put into practice , to make sure they meet the needs of people from ethnic minorities has a publicly - stated policy on race equality this requires public authorities to : prepare and publish a race equality scheme setting out how it intends to fulfil its obligations under the general duty , assess which of its functions and policies are relevant to the general duty set out its arrangements for assessing and consulting on the impact of the policies it adopts on the promotion of race equality set out its arrangements for monitoring for adverse impact on race equality set out its arrangements for publishing the results of assessments , consultation and monitoring . set out its arrangements for ensuring ethnic minorities have access to information and services it provides set out its arrangements for training staff on issues relevant to the duty of promoting race equality ._. _ _ futurelab is committed to sharing innovative practice and latest thinking . through our events programme , we bring together the media , educational and technology sectors to explore emerging themes and share ideas in an open , non -

bdo stoy hayward reveals staggering tax hikes and gives wake - up call to tax payers 02/06/06 date : 02/06/2006 on 3 june uk tax payers stop working for the government and start working for themselves and for this reason the day has been coined ' tax freedom day ' . this date is three days later than in 2005 and nine days later since the current government came to office in 1997 . in order to fund the government 's net debt , which has increased by � 110 billion since 1998 * * , and public spending programme there have been significant tax and excise duty rises which have directly affected uk tax payers . three taxes have significantly increased their total collections over the past 12 months alone , according to analysis * * * of hm revenue and customs ( hmrc ) receipts by leading accountancy firm bdo stoy hayward : petroleum revenue tax has risen by nearly 60 per cent ; capital gains tax has increased by 26 per cent ; corporation tax has increased by 25 per cent . despite these considerable annual percentage increases , the firm 's research has revealed that these taxes only collect 15 per cent of the total taxes and duties collected by hmrc for the government . income tax ( � 130.8 billion ) , value added tax ( vat ) ( � 72.9 billion ) , corporation tax ( � 41.9 billion ) and stamp duty ( � 10.9 billion ) collect a far greater sum of tax for the chancellor and when combined , these taxes make up 82 per cent of the total sum collected . stephen herring , tax partner at bdo stoy hayward , explains : " once again it is unsurprising that we are working longer for the government due to rising taxes as the chancellor tries to reduce the budget deficit and continues to increase public spending , albeit at a lower rate of increase . in particular , taxpayers have particularly felt the squeeze on fuel duty and stamp duty . combined , these taxes have increased by an astonishing 283 per cent since the government came into power , and have directly affected the pocket of most uk tax payers . " this day provides a real wake - up call for taxpayers to ensure that they are using all of the relevant tax allowances and breaks to make significant tax saving . through investment in pensions and isas , inheritance tax planning and capital gains planning , the average uk taxpayer could save a significant amount of tax in most years . it is imperative for taxpayers to know their tax entitlements and to understand when and how they are taxed . " through adjusting tax bands and personal allowances since 1997/98 at below the rate at which salaries and wages have risen , the amount of income tax collected has increased by 55 per cent and in the last year alone has risen by � 7.9 billion . this is despite the government 's pledge not to increase the higher or basic rates of income tax . through this ' fiscal drag ' , bands are only rising by retail price inflation , not by earnings and as such , the number of higher rate taxpayers has risen from 2 million to 3.3 million since 1997 , according to the office of national statistics . vat collections have risen steadily since 1997 but over the last two years have reached a plateau . nevertheless , the sum of vat collected has increased by over � 20 billion since 1997/98 . businesses have also been heavily affected through the increase in the amount of money collected through corporation tax which has risen by 16 per cent in the last year alone . despite the impact of the rate reduction from 31 per cent to 30 per cent in 1999 , hmrc is collecting over � 10 billion more , through tracking corporate profitability and by , for example , hmrc 's well - publicised closing of perceived tax loopholes . although stamp duty does not collect a proportionately large amount of tax for the chancellor , the total collected has increased over the past nine years has risen by an incredible 135 % . the raising of levels of stamp duty land tax from one per cent to four per cent has increased the sum collected , however it has been magnified by the country 's healthy residential and commercial property markets . in order to help consumers , stephen herring , tax partner at bdo stoy hayward , has put together his top 4 ways to make uk workers ' money more tax efficient : 1 . use up personal allowances every taxpayer in the uk has an annual personal allowance of � 5,035 . herring states : " often it can be worthwhile to transfer savings accounts and income investments into non - earning spouse 's names to utilize their personal allowance . " 2 . make use of tax - free savings up to � 3,000 per year can be put in a cash individual savings account ( isa ) . herring advises : " this is one of the most efficient ways of reducing tax on savings and should be used to its full advantage . often it is simply inertia which prevents people from getting on to doing this , my advice is act now . " 3 . contributions to pensions these save tax at an individual 's full marginal rate of taxation and since pensions " a day " , the limits on contributions have been significantly relaxed . 4 . planning for inheritance tax " proper planning can often ensure that both a husband and wife 's full zero rate bands are utilised on their deaths , " advises herring . press information : lisa cleaver or samantha dew at bdo stoy hayward on telephone : 020 7893 3989/3054 or firstname.surname@bdo.co.uk notes to editors : bdo stoy hayward is the uk member firm of bdo international , the world 's fifth largest accountancy network , with more than 600 offices in over 100 countries . bdo stoy hayward llp and bdo stoy hayward - belfast are both authorised and regulated by the financial services authority to conduct investment business . * this date is calculated by the adam smith institute ( www.adamsmith.org ) * * according to the office of national statistics * * * the figures used for analysis were taken from hmrc annual receipts , available at_in _ _ ( thriller ) a talented cast including eriq ebouaney ( kingdom of heaven ) , gerard mcsorley ( omagh , veronica guerin ) and james frain ( 24 , into the blue , the count of monte cristo ) lead the front line by director david gleeson . the film tells the story of joe yumba , a musician from the democratic republic of congo whose application for asylum in ireland has been successful . happy with his job as a security guard in the bank , his world is turned upside down when dublin 's nastiest criminals make him an offer he can not refuse . the front line is an epic story of redemption spanning the continents of europe and africa . screening at luff : tuesday 27th june 2 pm ( drama ) based on a true story , hell in tangier tells the story of marcel and wim , two belgian bus drivers , arrested in morocco for allegedly smuggling drugs . although innocent , they are sentenced to five years imprisonment and transferred to the jail of tangier . nothing could have prepared them for the hell that awaits them there . a brutal account of a horrific injustice .

evidently certain in the moment . we do n't have to give up our opinions to experience gnosis . they may be useful , beautiful , valid opinions . but we do need to discriminate them from what we actually are knowing now . what are you knowing right now ? if you pay attention to your immediate experience of reality and ask yourself this question you will realise that most of what you think you know you really do n't ! life is extremely mysterious . what is this moment ? what is it to be alive ? completely focus on the now and you will feel a rush of excitement as you become conscious of the awesome mystery of existence . step out of the world of your preconceptions and become conscious of reality for once . it is something most of us so rarely do , it can be a liberating surprise . we are usually so engrossed in the stories we tell about life that we do n't notice something extremely important about our predicament . we do n't know what is going on ! we are so busy pretending that we know who we are and what life is that we somehow manage to ignore the shocking truth . we do n't understand life at all . we are so lost in our concepts about life that we rarely give our open - minded attention to the mysterious experience of living here and now . we are eating the menu not the meal . no wonder we so often find life hard to swallow . when we confront existence without our habitual assumptions , we see our beliefs for what they are . stories . concepts . words . and we see that the stories we tell about life are not life itself . life is infinitely enigmatic . the word reality is not reality . we do n't know what reality is . this radical not - knowing is the first step towards genuine knowing . this rejection of our theories about life in favour of becoming conscious of the mysterious experience of living in this moment is the prerequisite for gnosis . most people have experienced at least brief moments when they have found themselves catapulted into the mystery of the moment . anything can trigger this . often it is confronting death . someone close to you dies , or you are diagnosed as seriously ill , and suddenly you are face - to - face with the fact that you really do n't know what life is . let alone what death is ! or it may be a moment of exquisite beauty which does it . you fall in love or give birth to a child , and suddenly you remember the miracle of existence . it may be a walk in the mountains or the feeling of the sun warming your back . or it may happen for no obvious reason at all . whatever the apparent cause , most of us have had moments of overwhelming wonder or overpowering terror in which we have suddenly become conscious of the awesome mystery of existence . if , whilst reading these words , you have been able to put your opinions on one side and become conscious of the mystery of this moment , you will have already experienced a radical shift in consciousness . it will feel as if you previously existed in some sort of semi - conscious trance , in which you were so mesmerised by your ideas about life that you hardly noticed how miraculously strange it is to be alive . how mind - blowing it is that you exist at all . the mystery of existence will be so obvious it will seem astonishing that you are usually oblivious to it . you will realise how unconscious you normally are ! if you become conscious of the mystery of this moment you will begin to understand why the original gnostic christians compared life to a dream and gnosis to waking up . because you will feel as if you have awoken from some sort of unconscious stupor . you will have begun to rouse yourself from the collective coma we mistake for � real life ' by becoming conscious of reality itself ._. _ _ statutory instrument 2004 no . 107 the solvent emissions ( england and wales ) regulations 2004 � crown copyright 2004 statutory instruments printed from this website are printed under the superintendence and authority of the controller of hmso being the queen 's printer of acts of parliament . the legislation contained on this web site is subject to crown copyright protection . it may be reproduced free of charge provided that it is reproduced accurately and that the source and copyright status of the material is made evident to users . it should be noted that the right to reproduce the text of statutory instruments does not extend to the queen 's printer imprints which should be removed from any copies of the statutory instrument which are issued or made available to the public . this includes reproduction of the statutory instrument on the internet and on intranet sites . the royal arms may be reproduced only where they are an integral part of the original document . the text of this internet version of the statutory instrument which is published by the queen 's printer of acts of parliament has been prepared to reflect the text as it was made . a print version is also available and is published by the stationery office limited as the the solvent emissions ( england and wales ) regulations 2004 , isbn 0110484827 . the print version may be purchased by clicking here . braille copies of this statutory instrument can also be purchased at the same price as the print edition by contacting tso customer services on 0870 600 5522 or e -
