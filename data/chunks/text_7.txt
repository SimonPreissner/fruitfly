" the people who live there are strong and the cities fortified and very large ; and moreover we saw the descendants of anak there . " there were giants in the land . they said that they felt like grasshoppers in their presence . their comfort zones were invaded . only two men stood with moses , joshua and caleb . these were the only ones who kept the vision of god before their eyes . god judged the people for their faithlessness and delayed their entrance by 40 years . all of that generation would die , except joshua and caleb . forty - five years later , caleb had not forgotten what he had seen . he gave his testimony . he said that he followed the lord god fully . and god made him a promise that he might enter the promised land and claim his inheritance . now at age eighty - five , that vision burned bright as ever . he stood before joshua with sword in hand . he wanted his mountain . caleb noted that " my brethren who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear , but i followed the lord fully . " there are two kinds of leaders in god 's kingdom , those who look through the eyes of faith and those who do not . those who look through the eyes of faith follow god fully even when the way seems impossible . they know that god will open the door at the right time and his will certainly will be accomplished . those who have no faith are the ones who discourage the people with the " facts . " we ca n't do these things because of the economy or because of the atmosphere of uncertainty . never mind that it is god who is in control . as we face the new year , the congregation has to decide who they will listen to . men of faith or men of fear ? caleb would not be deterred . he had waited for 45 years to get a chance to fulfil god 's plan . more than anything else , he was committed to be the people of god . furthermore , god had promised a particular place , biblical hebron , to be caleb 's . the nasb translates it as a hill , the kjv translates it as a mountain . i like mountain because it sounds like a challenge . and even at 85 , caleb was more than ready to meet the challenge . he wanted that mountain . he was committed to doing what god commanded . we are called to be the people of god . the people of god worship , we educate and train . but we also reach others with the gospel , we attend the needs of the poor , we become christ to the world . in order for us to be the people of god in our community , there are several mountains that must be conquered . one of the mountains is small thinking . the 10 spies , who gave the report that caused the people 's heart to melt , were guilty of small thinking . they were thinking only of what they could do , not what god could do . we serve a great god and he wants to do great things with us . but for that to happen , we have to be men and women of faith and simply trust him . his vision must become our mission . and the question is not can we do it , but how are we going to do it . we have to conquer the mountain of disunity . we ca n't be competing with each other over separate agendas . in our congregational polity , we seek god 's will by prayer and then we vote our conscience . it is remarkable that god has lead us this way . it is a supernatural event . and yet , after we have voted , there are some who try to make the people 's heart 's melt by their negative talk and their general lack of faith . if we are to be the people of god then we must be of one mind . the church seeks god and comes to a mutual conclusion what god wants us to do . it is the body of christ that must seek out christ and his will and then do it . we must seek god 's word and to be filled with his holy spirit so that we may be unified . and once we are unified , we ca n't let others deter us from doing the will of god . another mountain that we must conquer is the mountain of busyness . our commitment to christ must be such that we do n't let lesser things distract us . it is nice to have hobbies , but christian discipline requires us to set limits so that we may not steal god 's time . i am sorry , but good intentions do not get the job done . good intentions , without the work , leaves the job undone . we are too busy . we need to simplify our lives enough so that god 's work gets done . sometimes busyness is just another excuse for laziness . either way , we can dream all we want but if we are not willing to put in the time , money and effort , we will not see god 's kingdom built through our work . the last mountain that i see , and perhaps it is the biggest , is the mountain of fear . we can not let fear keep us from serving god . fear can express itself in the inability to give a verbal witness of our faith . it can cause us to not give out tithes and offerings or to commit to pledge sacrificially when called upon . fear can keep us from teaching or visiting or entering into new relationships with fellow christians so that we can build each other up . it was fear that kept a whole generation from enjoying the promised land . fear can keep us from being what god wants us to be . it is a fresh , new year . god 's vision for us has not changed . yes , there are mountains to conquer , they are opportunities for us to express faith in god and watch him work . this is our fiftieth year as a church . when june comes and we celebrate our anniversary together , i hope we are well on our way to conquering the mountains of pumpkin center and building the kingdom of god ._. _ _ it is scary to think that i first bought this album over 30 years ago and that my initial reaction was one of disappointment . the vinyl album was supposed to include a giant fold - out black and white poster of j.r.r. tolkien himself - and my copy did n't have it , nor did the shop i 'd bought it from ! i am pleased to say that my initial impressions soon changed . back in those days i used to listen to most music through headphones , the ideal environment for this sort of music , which today would be described as " ambient " . it 's an album for consulting the titles , closing your eyes , and then imagining the scenes from the book as the music washes over you . the sleeve notes talk of " helping you fill in the blanks and leaving a lot to your imagination " and this is certainly true . regarded by many as the first tolkien - inspired musical album , hansson 's music is unique : pleasant without being bland and imaginative without being showy . more importantly it is timeless and it is amazing , to this listener , how un - dated it sounds given the passage of time since it was recorded in 1969 ! the album was " cleaned up " by hansson in 1988 and has been re - released on cd this year ( 2002 ) by virgin records , presumably to cash - in on the movie success . and very welcome it is too . hansson is a superb musician , very much a sort of swedish mike oldfield , although perhaps not quite so crass , and although i personally preferred his follow - up album there is no doubt that this is the album that opened up hansson 's music to many fans around the world . hansson used synthesiser 's before they were fashionable , and yet somehow they do n't sound like synthesisers . there 's nothing showy here - everything just fits in together perfectly , forming the perfect soundscape for your mind to conjure up images from the book . this is a very different album from that of howard shore 's movie score , but no less perfect for all that . virgin are to be commended for not only issuing the album with reproductions of the original sleeve , but also this time including a small booklet that tells us more about the enigmatic hansson , and what he 's been doing in the many years since this album was first released . of course it 's hard to know whether my love for this album is based on the nostalgia of youth ( it was one of very few albums i owned at the age of 15 or 16 ) or love of the music itself . i suspect it is the latter ( and other opinions over at amazon seem to bear me out ) - it 's hard to think of other albums that were originally issued around the time this one was first released , that have stood the tests of time so well . highly recommended !

' we exchanged e - mails and i agreed to meet the guy ( a person called alex ) half way and delete some of the longer mixes in order to free up some webspace at their end . i then said to the representative that i would begin overwriting the audio files with smaller versions , more or less operating a ' one up one down ' system . here is the last exchange at that time : ' alex , quick e - mail to let you know that i have deleted around half a gig 's worth of real audio from soulwalking at your servers . from now on i will operate a ' one up / one off ' policy so that the files do not grow in size . i am out all day today , however , i will pick up my mail tonight . i hope that helps you in your space problems . all the best , toby ' ... he got back to me .... ' hi toby , thanks very much for your email and efforts to assist us . i ca n't foresee a problem with the one - up , one - off policy . have a great day alex ' on mon , 16 sep 2002 problem solved ? well i thought so . i continued overwriting files , whilst in the last year or so , the company relocated from the south of england to scotland . a couple of weeks back i took a phone call from one of their scottish representatives . back to square one . even though the file sizes were being reduced , they wanted me to lose around 90 % of the files . i went through the conversation i had with the company three years previously . he said he 'd get back to me . i have just spoken to another representative and gone through the whole story again . representative 1 said that the site would function normally , although less people would be able to access the audio at times . representative 2 said that i was still using too much space and they were ' suspending the service ' . so we have gone from ' upload what you like ' to ' remove your files ' in the space of five years . one thing that did seem a little harsh was he described the content of the audio files as ' dubious ' . in what way ? the system works that the artist sends me their material , i upload the music , people stream the music , people go out and buy the product , the companies make money , the artist makes money , and i make diddly squat . the first rep suggested i start placing banners all over the site , start earning money from the place ... and then give that money to them so i can keep my files there . in the meantime , the industry smells money and comes down on me like a ton of bricks . rep number 2 said he is going to freeze the content of the site audio and contact sony to see if having these files up at soulwalking is actually legal ! hello ... you host a website that supports streaming audio . streaming audio means that people can listen but not download the files . cd baby would close tomorrow if their audio did not stream . rep 2 began talking about licensing issues . i pointed it out to him that , if there was an issue with real audio streaming requiring licensing , it has taken them 5 years to find out that they are acting illegally themselves ! what is the real audio server supposed to be for ? bird noises ? look out i am about to be sued by a flock of geese ! all told , my belief is they are trying to lose this particular customer , as they are not making the ï¿½ 2,400 ( $ 4,800 ) per year that rep 1 suggested i paid them to keep the site 's audio intact .... but wait on , my site content is ' dubious ' ! legal if they make a lot of money from me , but not otherwise . well all i can say is ' bring on the music industry ' . rep 2 said he had a contact at sony , who will be looking at my ' dubious ' files . take a look . i bought all of these albums . so much money into the industry and they are looking to punish the customer . if they looked at where we lived and our bank account , they would be ashamed of themselves . after all , i am advertising their product for free . rep 1 told me that the site was too successful and they were n't expecting so many hits ! i thought that was what the internet is all about ? maybe i should have turned the site into one based around the antics of a praying mantis ! lol one hit every four years ! all told , if someone sells you a car , on the basis that it will get you from a to b , and you pay them for that service , then the car only takes you half way , you 'd expect to be a little bemused and ask for your money back . you 'd legally be entitled to that . all this is a long winded way of letting you know that the audio will not function at the site right now . i am waiting for the call that tells me the content is ' dubious ' and will be deleted immediately . i always thought ' dubious ' meant that there was something lewd on a particular site . quite offensive in many ways . folks who put that stuff on their sites ought to be locked up . i was tempted to do a 2003 and take the whole site down , but i am not sure i could face the barrage of e - mail again . the site will , unfortunately , be a little like detective petrocelli 's house or the death star in star wars . never totally complete , but i 'll still work on the place when i can . i 'll leave the charts and audio pages there , just for recommendation purposes . odd that the last time i had troubles at the site , lizz wright was on the index page . she 's there again with her new album ! i 'll have to have words with her ! anyone know any reasonably priced providers that support real audio ? not sure that i want to stay with these guys and , all told , i do n't make them enough money to be a valued customer . used to be a time that the customer ' was always right ' . not thesedays unfortunately . the rep 2 actually put the phone down on me during the first call , by the way . customer service ? company is called easyspace , by the way . i have recommended them to many people . not quite as ' easy ' as i thought ......_nfp _ _ payment by results ( pbr ) and patient choice are examples of system reform that are having profound effects on the way healthcare is being organised in england . many primary care and acute hospital trusts are experiencing severe financial pressures at a time when they are expected to balance their books and compete with independent treatment centres and other trusts for elective waiting list work . there are increasing anxieties that some existing hospital services , if not whole hospitals , will close as a consequence of the financial pressures . foundation hospital status which is increasingly being sought by acute trusts does not appear to necessarily protect hospitals from these pressures . the preliminary results from the bgs england 2005 survey , which will be reported in the next newsletter , suggest that medical care of the elderly departments are already feeling these pressures , particularly in relation to the provision of rehabilitation services . the payment by results policy is gradually being implemented , initially for elective procedures , but it will soon apply to emergency admissions , initially just in the foundation trusts but the policy will later roll out to all trusts , especially if or rather when they are all foundation trusts . the single national tariff for each procedure or medical condition will force trusts to review the costs of providing services and inevitably , they will review whether to continue to provide loss making services . the higher tariffs however , for patients with significant co - morbidity has led to new interest in accurate coding and discharge information amongst clinicians and hospital managers . trusts with high overhead costs will inevitably be challenged by payment by results as the tariff is the same for all trusts . the policy would more appropriately be called payment by activity , as outcome is not directly linked into the payment systems at the outset though perhaps high quality services will be rewarded by the reform . traditionally a large number of hospital beds have been used to provide care of older people but they have often been poorly staffed and / or occupied by patients ( or customers ! ) whose discharge has been delayed . the reimbursement policy has , however , probably reduced the overall number of delays but many of these rehabilitation beds have now been closed as trusts seek to save money . another national policy aim is to stem the tide of emergency medical admissions at a time when there is reduced out of hours gp cover and increased numbers of a&e attendees . developing alternatives to hospital admission should involve joint working between local primary and secondary care clinicians . the roll out of payment by results and practice based commissioning may produce a massive incentive for primary care to deal with more patients in the community . there is a fear that older people could be denied access to services in some areas . geriatricians traditionally have used policy initiatives to help develop their services . there are potential opportunities that might accompany payment by results . if the tariffs are set fairly and elderly care is dealt with as a discrete financial entity ( or cost centre in a trust ) then the chronic problem of fighting for resources might become easier as the cost of providing care and the income generated becomes explicit . gp fund holding led to competition between providers . there are already signs that payment by results and the challenges of the 2009 working time directive are forcing adjacent hospital trusts to develop partnership working between themselves and the primary care trusts to ensure that the services provided for the local populations are cost effective and quality assured . the challenge for geriatricians in 2006 is to use payment by results as an opportunity to develop better services for older people . there is initially a need to ensure that where rehabilitation beds are being or have been closed , that effective alternatives are established that can deliver patient centred care in the right environment , with the best possible patient outcomes in a system that integrates primary and secondary care to other services . james barrett chair : bgs england council_nnp _ _ journal of the holy roman empire a new ( spring 2006 ) ejournal for research on the history and culture of the empire ( the society for the study of the holy roman empire ) europe - e - journals laberinto publishes ' theoretical and/or cross - disciplinary readings of spanish and spanish - american texts and cultural productions from the early modern period ' writing - e - journals marteau 's publishing house journal includes illustrated articles in several languages , recent books and reviews ; conference information and calls for papers ; and the ' academy of projectors ' , with information about current researchers and their projects in late seventeenth and early eighteenth century topics ; really , much more than just a journal ( olaf simons ) e - journals renaissance forum an e - journal of early modern literary and historical studies ( university of hull )_-rrb- _ _ stay informed !

she used to sketch , in fact , he still had the one she did of blue jam rehearsing in his cellar . mickey knocked on the door , his hands suddenly clammy . she was obviously expecting him as she sat at a large drawing board , her hands in her lap . her long dark hair almost hiding her face . " hello mickey , " she said , rising to her feet . " it is you , then , " he said , recognising her immediately . she came towards him , hands still clasped together . i wondered if you 'd ever make the connection . she came to a stop in front of him . he was not a tall man himself , but she tiny . " i always knew there was something vaguely familiar about the art work , but i only looked up your name the other day . we 've had a busy year , " he told her . " i know , " she said quietly , " i 've followed your career . i ... " the telephone rang . " excuse me . " mickey turned to look at the work around the room . it was very good , very varied . record sleeves just a small part . " yes , by the end of the week , yes ... okay , leave it with me , " she was saying . when she replaced the receiver , he said , " look , i can see you 're busy . let 's get together sometime , eh ? " there was a pause before she answered , " no , i 'd rather not . " he looked at her with surprise . nobody turned him down these days . " why not ? " " because , " she was embarrassed . " because , i do n't want to dig up the past . i 'm sorry . " " i tried to find you , mel . they told me you were in an institution and not accepting visitors . " " look , " she said turning away , " i 've got a lot to do . " now he 'd found her , he did n't want to lose her . " i would 've helped , you only ever had to ask ? " he was hoping she would change her mind . when it had all come to a head , he 'd been away . there should have been the death penalty for what that man did . " no ! " she said , her dark eyes flared , " i said no . please just go , mickey . " he gazed at her for a long moment , before digging into his pocket for his card . if you should change your mind ... she did n't take it , so he dropped it onto the desk . mickey saw how his visit had upset her and was embarrassed at his thoughtlessness . he turned and left . driving home , his stereo for once quiet , his mind back to the day he first met her . she could n't have been more than fifteen or sixteen . he 'd heard a noise in the back garden and went to investigate . he caught her climbing over his fence with a fist full of flowers . she was so startled at having been caught that she fell and landed on his rockery . he 'd put up high fencing to protect his privacy . blue jam were already well known around clubland and the last thing he 'd wanted was fans peering in at windows . he 'd been angry , but the terror on her face and the blood on her arm stopped him voicing it . instead he had taken her into his kitchen and mopped up the blood and tears . and there began his strange relationship with melody . when mickey arrived home , he took a hot bath . it was a luxury to be able to take one without watching the clock . for the last twelve months the clock had governed all of their lives . photographic sessions , interviews , rehearsals , travelling andconcerts . although he loved it all , he was tired . tired of the decisions , tired of being at everyone 's beck and call . in the bath he dozed amongst the soap suds , enjoying the peace . when the water cooled , he got out , dried himself and put on a towelling robe . in the bedroom he turned on thetv and lay on the bed flicking through the channels . he watched mtv for a while before falling asleep . the sound of the telephone woke him some time later . " mickey ? " said a soft female voice . he was suddenly fully awake . " mel ? " " i want to apologise . i was rude . " " it 's okay . i probably gave you a shock turning up like that . " " you did and i associated you with everything else . but i was wrong . you were my saving grace . " " we were good friends and i was probably even in love with you . " she gave a little laugh . " i did n't want to be come dependant on you , it ... " " you should have , " he interrupted . " i would n't have turned you down . " " you 'd have ended up hating me . " " no i would n't , " he insisted . " nobody could have hated you . " " somebody did . " he fell silent remembering her brutal step father . " anyway , " she said quickly . " i just wanted to apologise for being rude . " " have dinner with me , mel . let 's talk . " " i do n't know , " she whispered . " look , it was n't your fault . you did n't have any control over your parents . " the phone went silent . " i know , it plays over and over in my mind like a broken record , " she said . he looked at the clock , it was almost seven . " look , i 'll come and get you and we 'll get a take away . " " all right , " she said . " i 'm still at work . " it did n't take him long to dress . maybe now he could put right some of the wrong . he 'd come home from a wonderful tour of the south , to find the man next door had murdered his wife . melody had been so traumatised , she could n't speak . she was waiting in the door way with a smile . they stopped to pick up pizza causing a stir as he was recognised . that seemed to amuse her and she chuckled most of the way home . as they swung into his road , he turned to see her ashen face . " i 'm sorry , " he gasped , " i never thought ..... we could go somewhere else . " how stupid of him ! he 'd never moved , he still lived next door to the house it happened in . " no , never mind , " she said , clearly shaken . they went straight through to the kitchen and mickey began opening the pizza boxes . looking up he saw melody sitting in the same corner . he would come home from gigs to find her sitting at his back door . he eventually gave her a key . he always found her sitting in the corner of the kitchen waiting for him . now her eyes looked back at him with that same haunted expression . " are you all right ? " he asked . " i 'm just exorcising a few ghosts , " she said . he was exorcising ghosts himself . in those days , what went on behind closed doors was the business of the family . he did n't want to think too deeply about it . but he 'd done his bit . he provided her with a refuge , provided her with a shoulder to cry on . only she rarely cried , she never talked about their cruelty , their unnatural behaviour . sometimes thought , he could heard her crying through the wall , sometimes he came home and saw she had been crying , but when she saw him , she always smiled . " mickey , i have something to tell you , but it 's not easy . " she got up from the corner , and stood by the piano . " tell me what ? " he had the first stirrings of doubt . " about what happened . " " i have n't the stomach for gory details , " he said , but it was n't that , he just did n't want to face his own guilt . there were tears in her eyes as she began to speak , he did n't want to hear , but could n't find the words to stop her . " you 're not making sense , melody , " he said eventually . " that 's because he did n't kill my mother - i did . " mickey felt his heart miss a beat . he held his breath as her words reverberated inside his head . the colour left his face . melody was staring at him , tears spilling down her cheeks . " say something , " she muttered . finally he let out his breath . he opened his mouth and no words came out . " mickey , i 'm so sorry , " she whispered , " i could n't tell you , you were helping me , i was afraid . " he came round the piano to where she was standing and grabbed her arms . you murdered someone and said nothing ! she was sobbing and gave him a million reasons why her mother deserved all she got . finally he watched her leave . the air was full of promises , empty promises . it was clear to him that her dad must have loved her very much to take the blame . she had said he would get parole soon and they would be together . mickey did n't want to think about that either . he threw the pizza 's into the bin , then turned on the tape recorder and sat down at the piano . it was like a burden had been taken from him . he began to play , softly at first , like a breeze rustling through the trees . as the music filled his head it rose to a faltering crescendo . the words would not be easy , but melody 's melody was destined to be blue jams finest . k.j. mossman ~ down by the river as soon as shelby stepped off the bus , she knew she was already too late . the feeling at the pit of her stomach was almost unbearable . " ma'am , you okay ? " the bus driver asked as she swayed slightly in the early morning heat . " yes , yes i 'm fine , thank you , " she responded . the feeling passed quickly but she was left with a sense of foreboding . the sun made her squint through her dark glasses as she began the long trek down the dusty road . this small kansas town was repressive . since the death of her mother annie - clare , life with her drunken pa had become unbearable . shelby was cursed with a gift , a gift that left her open to taunts and cruelty . life would have been intolerable if it had not been for mary - jo . she too , suffered taunts as people did not understand her . she had a simplicity that they mistook for stupidity . so she and mary - jo had befriended each other . mary - jo had written her long scrawly , barely legible letters . for some time now she had spoken of ricky , and how happy he had made her . ricky was an outsider . the town did not like him , did not trust him and mary - jo was condemned for loving him . he lived in a trailer near the river . as shelby made her wary way over there she thought about what mary - jo had said about him . when he was a boy he had lived with his mother outside town . the house had mysteriously burned down with his mother and her lover inside it . they said he torched it himself , but no one knew for sure . he grew up in an orphanage where his reputation as a bad boy steadily grew . as she approached he was coming out of the door . quickly she took in his tall , thin appearance . he wore denim jeans and jacket with an old vest underneath . his dark hair was long to his shoulders , his dark eyes broody . " are you ricky ? " she asked tentatively , although she knew he was . he looked her up and down sullenly . " what if i am ? " he growled . " i 'm shelby , " she told him as he pinned back the trailer door . " is that supposed to mean something ? " " i 'm mary - jo 's friend ? " " oh , that shelby , " he said going back inside . she hesitated before following . the trailer was surprisingly neat and spacious inside . he had sat down in front of the television , the sound too low to hear . " i 'm looking for mary - jo , " she explained , standing awkwardly in the doorway . " she ai n't here , " he replied without looking up . " have you seen her ? " " nope . " he still did not look up , then he said quietly , " you ran out on her . " shelby swallowed nervously . " she did n't mind , she understood . " " she minded , she minded very much . " he turned to her and she felt uncomfortable as his eyes travelled round her body . she sat on the bunk and fidgeted with her fingers . " she said she was in trouble - wanted me to come , " she told him . " oh yeah ? that 's gallant of you . " his anger made her uneasy . " she 's my friend and she needs me . " he glared at her making her wish she had not chosen those words . " her friend ? " he repeated . the guilt that shelby felt for leaving in the first place , still played on her mind . " please , ricky , you do n't understand . " " no , " he said looking back to the television . " i know something 's wrong . i thought she would be here . " " well , she ai n't and i 'd prefer it if you were n't either . " getting to her feet , shelby felt a little braver . " it does n't matter what you think of me , but i know you care for mary - jo ... " ricky was up off his chair in a flash , shelby flinched and stepped back slightly . " what the hell do you know ? i might care for her , but if she cared for me ... " he stopped as they heard the sound of cars . ricky looked out of the window and cursed . shelby was frightened , sensing more than she knew . two cars screeched to a halt and within a moment the trailer was full of police . ricky tried to run . it was natural for him to run . shelby watched with horror as he was violently hand - cuffed and dragged outside . she had forgotten how brutal the police could be . " leave him alone ! " she cried despairingly as they dragged him away . " well , well . if it ai n't little shelb ? " said a familiar voice and rawden hughes laughed . " i thought you 'd gone for good . " shelby flinched her eye catching his badge and his promotion to sheriff .. " that 's right , " he said noticing where her eyes went . " i 'm the big boy now . maybe you know where mary - jo is ? " " if i did , i would n't tell you , " she told him following them outside anxiously . rawden s face darkened and his bushy eyebrows knitted together . " i 'm the law round here now , girl . you have to tell me . " " i 've just arrived , i do n't know anything , " she said hoping that he could not see her trembling . " and if you know what 's good for you , you 'll leave again , today , " he told her as he got back into the car . as she watched them screech off , she caught the curious look ricky shot her . she and rawden hughes went back a long way . she was indebted to him and he never let her forget it . her father was sitting next to the fire , staring at the flames . he was sober . he did not look up as she entered . the place smelled , or , looking at his clothes , it could have been him . she turned her nose up slightly . " i thought you 'd be back . you shoulda ' let me know . i 'd have picked you up from the bus . " " yes , well , i did n't know you 'd be sober , " she told him looking round , nothing changed . " a whole year and no word ? " he said as she sat down in the high backed chair feeling tired . " i came back ` cos of mary - jo . " she watched him light a cigarette and draw heavily on it . " you 're a fool to come back here . " he said staring moodily into the fire . " i should never have left mary - jo , " she said wistfully . there was tension in this town and it frightened her . closing her eyes shelby leaned her head back on the chair . in her head she saw the swirling of water ; tears of betrayal and shame . shelby shook her head to lose the image and quickly opened her eyes . her father was watching her , his cigarette almost finished . " do n't fight it , shelby , " he said quietly . the sound of her heart was pounding in her ears . " you ought to talk with that crazy boy she 's been hanging around with .

' major ' results everyone will have different ideas on this . anyway my definition is either a ) a first , second or third in a black type race ( aka a black - type performer ) or b ) a result ( win or place ) in any type of race that results in at least the following prize money , which increases slightly over the years ; 1980 - 1984 inc . ï¿½ 7,000 1985 - 1989 inc . ï¿½ 8,000 1990 - 1994 inc . ï¿½ 9,000 1995 -2000 inc ï¿½ 10,000 2001 -2003 inc . ï¿½ 12,000 2004 onwards ï¿½ 14,000 however due to the incredible success of messrs johnston , easterby ( tim ) and nicholls i have treated them as ' special ' cases , so for those trainers the criteria is any race where the prize money earned was more than ï¿½ 20,000 ( regardless of the year or type of race ) . i 'd like to make the criteria a bit more complicated than that ( including group placings for these trainers for example ) - but unfortunately ms access is n't upto the job . how it 's done i 've produced a report in ms access which exports the relevant ' major ' results into html . it was n't quite as easy as it sounds however and i 've had to make compromises such as missing off jockeys claim , distance , course etc . i then redo this export and ftp it upto the site on a reasonably regular basis . hopefully the layout of the report will improve over time . if you feel the data could be better presented - eg.by year by trainer instead of just by trainer and then sorted in date order please let me know . some statistics i 've done some queries in the database for the 2003 flat season ( all weather and turf ) , for the trainers i followed in depth that season . obviously i ca n't guarantee that these statistics are 100 % accurate , it 's always possible i 've missed the odd winner or runner . the first shows winners ( not numer of wins ) per individual runner ( not runs ) in other words : " what is the percentage likelihood that a horse with this trainer will win a race ? " , and on this criteria the top 10 trainers are as follows ;_: _ _ the story so far ... ï¿½ after dark ' duo was formed in 1996 , and comprises wendy on lead vocals , and bill on electric and acoustic guitars , keyboard and vocals . both in their early thirties , wendy and bill have between them over thirty years ' experience as musicians and entertainers . when they met during the summer of ï¿½ 96 , they found that their musical tastes and belief in what constitutes a top act were so well attuned that forming a duo was the most natural progression for them both . they quickly invested in the very best midi , pa and stage / lighting equipment , and since then have been committed to becoming such an act . in terms of repertoire , they now cover some of the best known classics from artists from the 50 's to the best hits of modern day , such as : simply red erasure bon jovi stevie wonder celine dion phil collins m people tammy wynette shania twain ï¿½ fats ' waller bryan adams frank sinatra the eagles cher oasis back street boys the spice girls the corrs tina turner patsy cline robbie williams queen ricky martin the everley brothers free bette midler status quo ( ! ) annie lennox elvis presley gary moore chuck berry sister sledge eric clapton the blues brothers extreme they also feature music from popular shows such as the rocky horror picture show , fame and grease ! while the ' after dark ' style could most generally be described as pop / rock , bill and wendy enjoy being able to select the songs which are most appropriate for a particular venue , from gentle lounge music to 60 's and 70 's , disco , rock or just out - and - out party sets . in most cases they tend to find that a real mixture of these styles is best received . between sets and at the end of the night , they ensure that the atmosphere is maintained with gentle background music or pumping disco as appropriate . finally , many similar acts are often focused on strong musical performance alone . ' after dark ' believe that together with this , an emphasis on costume , showmanship and audience rapport help them to really ï¿½ make the difference ' . following a successful international contract in a five star hotel in dubai , ' after dark ' is now working extensively in the uk , providing high quality entertainment for weddings , quality hotels ( e.g. hilton , stakis ) , forces events , political clubs , formal balls , sporting clubs , parties , competitions and corporate events .

toe through the man eating daffodils on this one . actually , the levels are quite good , so that makes my job easier . i think , having played through the levels on ultra - violence , i can say that colin 's specialty is more fast , furious gameplay than intricate architecture . actually , that is my one real complaint about these levels : they suffer from boxy architecture and nothing feels particularly organic . overall , the levels cling to a quasi - knee deep style . what i like most is that doom 2 monsters , generally obnoxious , stay in the background here : most of the monsters in this pack are imps and sargeants in large numbers , with barons and cacos playing backup , with only the occasional appearance of some bloodthirsty mancubi . when the doom2 monsters do appear , they are used to good effect : a sniping chaingunner , a close - quartered revenant , a tribe of hell knights , etc . overall , the levels have a good usage of traps and excellent health and ammo balance ( by which i mean , agonizingly low - just looking at my ammo bar made me itch sometimes , just the way i like it ) . another drawback is some minor texture misalignment , but nothing earth shattering . here is a level by level run down . hangar - nice opening fire fight . it appears that what colin was going for was an opening hangar where you 've landed your space ship . unfortunately , the space ship is pretty lame looking . the level is n't particularly organic feeling , with a lot of dependency on 90 degree angles . still , monster placement is pretty good ... as you leave the spaceship for the first time , you encounter a large outdoor area with lots of sargeants , imps , and cacos , where you scurry around for a bit trying to get them to take care of each other . a few texture misalignments , but nothing serious . ammo and health are deliciously , though not impossibly , low . a good first level , excelling in violence but not in architecture . toxin refinery - a fairly good level , brought down by an obnoxious nukage maze . ammunition is -really- tight in this level ... i ended up using my unberzerked fists at one point . there is a huge trap in the room that yields that red key card that seems a bit overdone to me : thankfully , its a time based trap , so if you can stay alive for thirty seconds , then for another thirty seconds ( once you grab the red key , the door shuts behind you ) , you 'll be all set . this is the first level where the new switch that colin uses becomes a bit frustrating , since it looks more or less just like a computer screen and it took me a bit to find it . this is actually a common theme in the later levels , and one that can be annoying - this computer switch blends in perfectly with a lot of the computer - room surroundings , and when you have to flip five or six of them at a time , can be almost impossible to locate . nuclear plant - this is a power plant , but i thought that it did n't have much of a power plant feel , in that there was n't a lot of chugging machinery or nukage around to make me feel at home . a pretty decent level with ( as usual in this pack ) some nice gun fights , although the architecture is really straight forward and none - too - elaborate . there 's a nice close - quartered fight with a baron of hell and too large cooling towers which , again , while not particularly pretty architecturally , satisfy my dooming urge for really huge towers to stand up on . :) command center - the first level in the pack that i thought was -really- fun . its very old school ( like most of the levels in the pack ) with a lot of imps , cacos , and demons running around as shotgun fodder . architecturally bland , it still manages to fit in lots of pulsing gun fights . i really like levels where a room you emptied minutes before will be swarming with monsters again when you go back to it . one complaint , however , is that many of the monsters are gratuitous : i just ran by them , effectively leaving about 60 monsters looking for me once i exitted the level . i want to -have- to kill the monsters , not kill them at my leisure . also , this level is distinctly multi - leveled , which is fun ... you 'll see an area or an alcove in one section of the map and mutter to yourself , " gee , i wonder how i get up there , " and then , ten minutes later , you find yourself up there fighting imps and sargeants . very cool effort . phobos lab - i really liked this level as well . it is a level with a lot of nukage and base - style corridors circling around a gigantic pit where you can see other portions of the level , complete with monsters . in the middle of said pit is the exit , and you need to figure out how to raise a bridge to get to it . a lot of violence in enclosed spaces , and a harrowing fight with a baron of hell on a tiny catwalk that was a lot of fun . however , like all of the levels in this pack , it suffers from some architectural blandness . central processing - i remember this level most simply because you finally get the super shotgun in it . i thought this was pretty cool , actually : i really love the super shotgun as a weapon , but many times , levels play better if you are limited only to your workhorse shotgun , the single - barrel variety . it was rather strange , though , because most missions that you play in give the bloody thing to you right away . i had every weapon up to the plasma rifle when i got it . at any rate , level 6 is another very decent level , set in a very distinct computer and military base theme . a lot of fun , especially at the end , with a furious fight involving changunners , mancubi , cacodemons , and some spectres . computer base - the longest level and one of the most violent , this is also in a heavy computer - base style and a very fun play . it is one of those maps where every time you enter a new area , some place in the level that you just left changes in some way . the map loops back on itself by lots of new doors opening , secret passages appearing , etc , and there are always monsters to be shooting . it has a nice final shootout as well , with walls full of imps and sargeants shooting at you as you try to fend off two barons . this was fun , but colin included the invulnerability sphere , which is necessary , but makes the area too easy . i 'd rather play an insanely hard level which is possibly without the iv by way of architecture that i can take advantage of than just pick it up and start madly firing rockets around . however , another solid level overall . phobos anomaly - kind of a disapponting final fight . 4 barons that are essentially locked in pits in the ground to potshot , and then a 30 second mad dash as a room full of arachnotrons , imps , and demons warp into the room . you run around firing rockets for a little bit , then walk into the teleport , and its over . i was hoping after all the weapons i 'd stocked up earlier in the game to go head to head with a cyberdemon or something . but no such luck . i just feel that in a final fight , you should be made to go up against enemies that you have not encountered in earlier levels . overall , what did i think ? good levels , and worth the download . playability gets a 4 and architecture gets a 3 for overall " blockiness " , although this trait seemed to wear down as the levels progressed . i think that the map pack shows that colin learned a thing or two about doom designing as he made these levels . the pros are some furious gun action , great weapon and health balance , and overall bloody and fun maps . the cons are some minor texture misalignments , a bland architecture style in many of the levels , and one hell of an obnoxious switch texture ( by the way , you can see said texture to the left in the navigation bar ) . a good effort . download phobos3.zip file list phobos3.zip , size 296 kb , date 1998/3/16 . phobos3.wad , size 917 kb , date 1998/2/27 ._. _ _ there are many activities and outdoor pursuits available close to callander including angling , hill walking , cycling , mountain biking , golfing , canoeing , windsurfing , water -

for others they may involve distances of thousands of miles , crossing national borders . all european bats are to a greater or lesser extent endangered with extinction . some have even become extinct in certain countries . the reasons for this are mainly loss of roosts and feeding areas , poisoning from increased use of pesticides , and misunderstanding and prejudice arising from ignorance about bats and their lives and habits . if bats are to be properly protected , conservation activities need to be undertaken at an international level , over the entire migratory range of these species . the agreement on the conservation of populations of european bats ( eurobats ) was concluded in london , uk in september 1991 , and came into force in january 1994 . the title of the agreement makes it clear that bio - geographical rather than political boundaries define the agreement area . the agreement aims to address threats to all 37 species of bats identified in europe arising from habitat degradation , disturbance of roosting sites and harmful pesticides . to this end , parties to the agreement agree to work through legislation , education , conservation measures and international co - operation with other agreement members and with those who have not yet joined . in 1995 , the first session of the meeting of parties to the agreement formed an action plan , which was to be translated into international action . they established an advisory committee to carry forward this plan between the meetings of parties . the most significant items for the advisory committee are data compilation on the most important underground habitats for bats , on migration routes , forest practices and producing guidelines on the catching and marking of bats . the action plan also places considerable emphasis on monitoring and international protection measures for species which migrate the furthest across europe , in order to identify and address possible dangers caused by bottle - neck situations in their migratory routes . as of november 2004 there were 30 contracting parties to the agreement ._. _ _ riverside has a varied programme of both domestic and international performance , theatre , dance and other events and considers work , either hires or co - productions , within the context of the building 's artistic policy . studio 2 is a classic medium - sized ï¿½ black box ' space with a comprehensive motorised grid , suited to all types of production . flexible configurations , up to 400 seating . 150 channels of 2k dimmers . 24 channels of 5k dimmers . recent refurbishment has included new seating and a new heating system . please note that studio 2 is our larger performance space , with a bi - monthly programme of work . it is not available for day hire . details please click the links below for full details of studio 2 technical specifications images selected recent productions cheek by jowl 's othello forced entertainment / lift 's bloody mess the actor 's gang in tim robbins ' embedded complicite 's mnemonic the wooster group with to you , the birdie !

( 4/06 ) c.g. timpson , `` the grammar of teleportation '' quant - ph/0509048 . in this careful discussion of quantum teleportation , timpson looks particularly at whether , leaving aside the classical signal which passes between the teleporters , it makes any sense to talk about the process as one involving the movement of information . his arguments are clear , interesting , and , in my opinion , correct . he stresses the fact that analyses of quantum processes may be interpretation dependent , and introduces the idea of the simulation fallacy to describe the common mistake of thinking that if some process requires certain resources ( such as non - local signaling or multiple computations ) to produce a classical simulation , then those resources must somehow also be required in a quantum manifestation of the process . my own analysis of quantum teleportation would involve noting that after alice has told bob which measurement result she has observed , she and bob will have each made compatible observations of the system consisting of the entire experimental context , and that therefore they will share predictions about future measurements . ( 6/06 ) s. weinstein , `` anthropic reasoning in multiverse cosmology and string theory '' hep - th/0508006 . weinstein suggests that the anthropic principle should be restricted to a narrow version which merely rules out theories which are incompatible with our actual existence . it seems to me that this is over - restrictive . if i have won the lottery , then the fact that someone had to win does not explain why it was me . it is natural and appropriate for me to wonder whether there was any reason for my success . such wondering is formalized by the versions of the anthropic principle which weinstein rejects . of course , in the lottery case i would presumably be wrong to assume that my winning was anything other than chance , but i do think that it would be a mistake for me not to consider the question . ( 5/06 ) m. schlosshauer , `` experimental motivation and empirical consistency in minimal non - collapse quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0506199 . schlosshauer reviews empirical evidence for quantum superpositions of mesoscopically distinguishable states in coherent quantum tunnelling in squids and in the interference of fullerene molecules . he also discusses the possibility of superpositions involving distinguishable particle numbers in bose - einstein condensates . the experiments schlosshauer describes provide significant evidence for the validity of schroedinger dynamics and decoherence mechanisms at ever - increasing scales . this supports the idea of a universal wavefunction which never collapses , but it leaves unanswered many questions about the nature of observation . schlosshauer remarks that neural decoherence rates are extremely fast . he then supposes that decoherence is sufficient to explain the emergence of subjective perceptions of single outcomes . while i agree that decoherence will be important for any such explanation , i have argued in donald 2002 that it is far from sufficient . n.p. landsman , `` between classical and quantum '' quant - ph/0506082 . an excellent review of a variety of ideas about the relationship between classical theories and quantum theories . landsman begins with a well - informed discussion of the significance of such ideas in the early development of quantum mechanics and in the copenhagen interpretation . he then turns to three relevant areas of mathematical physics and discusses theories of quantization , theories of classical limits , and some aspects of infinite system theories . i think his descriptions of these difficult but important theories are of exemplary clarity . he concludes with some remarks about decoherence and consistent histories . k. jacobs and h. wiseman , `` an entangled web of crime : bell 's theorem as a short story '' quant - ph/0504192 . members of a criminal gang are being held in separate cells . their lawyer manages to limit the questions the police can ask . around this scenario , jacobs and wiseman build a complicated tale , which is contrived and far - fetched and yet is completely conventional in physical terms . the result is that they produce circumstances which are such , that in way which would be impossible without quantum effects , the gang would be able to take advantage of quantum non - locality to harmonize their stories without actually commmunicating with each other during the questioning . jacobs and wiseman 's tale takes the form of an amusing parody . this is done well , except that the moral tone would perhaps better suit runyon than conan doyle . b. carter , `` micro - anthropic principle for quantum theory '' quant - ph/0503113 and `` anthropic interpretation of quantum theory '' hep - th/0403008 . carter seeks to define a probability for an individual perception . this , he says , involves refraining from assuming in advance that one has some particular identity . it seems to me that much of what he is doing amounts to making some preliminary steps towards a many - minds interpretation . however , he does not analyse the nature of perception ; i think he misplaces the boundary between subjective and objective ; and he does not provide adequate motivation for his suggested probability . in my opinion , a mind is defined by its history ( which requires an abstract characterization as a pattern of information ) . the probabilities at a particular moment of the possible short - term futures of an individual mind are of much greater significance than the cumulative improbability of that individual 's lifetime history . ( 5/06 ) s. aaronson , `` np - complete problems and physical reality '' quant - ph/0502072 . aaronson provides a clear , wide - ranging , and enjoyable discussion of ways in which the solution of apparently intractable computational problems might or might not become possible in the framework of various exotic physical theories . he then suggests that requiring the intractibility of np - complete problems places interesting constraints on physical theories . w.t.m. irvine , j.f. hodelin , c. simon , and d. bouwmeester , `` realisation of hardy 's thought experiment '' quant - ph/0410160 . using two mach - zehnder interferometers sharing a central beam splitter , irvine , hodelin , simon , and bouwmeester provide yet another forceful experimental demonstration of the failure of local hidden variable theories . however counter - intuitive it may be to do so , in my opinion one really has to stop thinking of individual particles as either going one way or the other around an interferometer ; whether those particles are photons , as in the present paper , or atoms , as in `` lithium atom interferometer using laser diffraction : description and experiments '' by a. miffre , m. jacquey , m. b ï¿½ chner , g. tr ï¿½ nec , and j. vigu ï¿½ , quant - ph/0410182 . physical situations are more accurately described in terms of quantum states and observations , than in terms of particles choosing paths . in `` bell 's theorem and the experiments : increasing empirical support to local realism '' quant - ph/0410193 , e. santos counters this opinion by arguing for the existence of loopholes in tests of bell 's inequalities . he suggests that local realism is so important as a scientific principle that we should abandon it only if faced with the most direct and unambiguous evidence . i think that santos 's conception of realism is unnecessarily narrow . also , i am inclined to accept the overall theoretical structure of quantum mechanics because of the wide range of empirical support for all sorts of detailed aspects of the theory . there may be loopholes , but it seems to me implausible that they are jumped through . nevertheless , santos 's paper is valuable as a thoughtful defence of an unpopular position . c.r. shalizi , `` the backwards arrow of time of the coherently bayesian statistical mechanic '' cond - mat/0410063 . the information - theoretic analysis of thermodynamic entropy suggests that entropy is a measure of our ignorance . in classical terms , the more states that a system can occupy given the constraints imposed by our knowledge of macroscopic parameters , the higher the entropy . shalizi argues that if entropy is a measure of how much we do n't know , then it should decrease as we learn more . her mathematics is impeccable , but her argument founders on the fact that only in the rarest of cases in which statistical mechanics is relevant ( such as spin - echo experiments ) , is precise past knowledge not washed out of the set of available observed physical states . ordinary macroscopic thermal systems are certainly not closed to the extent that she requires . in my opinion , the idea that entropy is a measure of ignorance is a useful heuristic which can usually be justified by investigation of a system 's internal and external interactions , by facts about `` typical states '' , and ultimately , by the structure of quantum probability ( donald 1992 ) . the higher the entropy of a quantum state satisfying our observational constraints , the more likely we are to make future observations compatible with that state . ( 5/06 ) e. dennis and t. norsen , `` quantum theory : interpretation can not be avoided '' quant - ph/0408178 . it is a shame that good arguments supporting realist interpretations of quantum theory so often end up in promotion of the bohm interpretation without due regard to its problems . it is also a shame that it seems to be so little understood that a theory in which observers are fundamental can be realist -- in the sense of being based on perception - independent truths ( amounting to `` objective realities '' or `` physical laws '' ) -- as long as it provides a complete characterization of the structures and the possible temporal developments of the observers . further discussion of the case for non - relativistic bohmian mechanics is provided by r. tumulka in `` understanding bohmian mechanics : a dialogue '' quant - ph/0408113 . in `` why bohm 's quantum theory ? '' quant - ph/9812059 , h.d. zeh argues that bohmian mechanics is essentially irrelevant in the light of decoherence theory . he points out that the global wave - function , which in bohm 's theory is supposed to pilot the particle trajectories , is identical to everett 's ( uncollapsing ) `` universal wave - function '' , and has exactly the same branching components ; even if all but one of these components is supposed to be empty of bohmian particles . similar points are made by h.r. brown and d. wallace in `` solving the measurement problem : de broglie - bohm loses out to everett '' quant - ph/0403094 . in `` why is n't every physicist a bohmian ? '' quant - ph/0412119 , o. passon reviews a range of objections to bohm theory . p. hayden , d.w. leung , and a. winter , `` aspects of generic entanglement '' quant - ph/0407049 . the idea of typical states with given properties is fundamental in classical statistical mechanics , as is the idea of typical sequences in classical information theory . i believe that a similar idea will also turn out to be of fundamental importance in quantum theory ; in particular in helping us to understand the apparent states of macroscopic objects and in encouraging us to give up the assumption that general physical systems ought to be described by pure states . the mathematics needed for working with this idea is gradually being developed , as exemplified by the paper of hayden , leung , and winter . this paper is introduced by hayden in `` entanglement in random subspaces '' quant - ph/0409157 . significant earlier steps in this development include the papers gr - qc/9305007 of d.n. page and hep - th/9601132 of s. sen on `` average entropy of a subsystem '' in which it is shown that the entropy of a typical unconstrained state on a small subsystem is close to maximal . in `` canonical typicality '' cond - mat/0511091 , s. goldstein , j.l. lebowitz , r. tumulka , and n. zanghi argue that a typical global pure state with a given approximate value of global energy has a reduced density matrix on a small subsystem which is close to the canonical ensemble density matrix -- exp(-h / kt)/z -- for the appropriate temperature . a much more general result along the same lines is proved by s. popescu , a.j. short , and a. winter in `` entanglement and the foundations of statistical mechanics '' quant - ph/0511225 .

'' quant - ph/0405126 . from time to time , it is suggested that quantum states are simply states of knowledge . in donald 2002 , i draw attention to the problems this raises with our understanding of psycho - physical parallelism . marchildon argues that it raises problems with our understanding of the relationship between macroscopic and microscopic objects . i agree that calling the reality of microscopic objects into question also calls into question the reality of macroscopic objects , but whereas in``bohmian trajectories and the ether : where does the analogy fail ? '' quant - ph/0502049 , marchildon looks to a realist interpretation of the trajectories of microscopic objects , i suggest that a realist interpretation of the structures constituting knowledge is sufficient . j.c. baez , `` quantum quandaries : a category - theoretic perspective '' quant - ph/0404040 . baez describes similarities between a category significant for quantum theory and one significant for general relativity . the similarities are at the level of abstract mathematical structure . baez claims that the mathematics `` accounts for many of the famously puzzling features of quantum theory '' . this is correct only in the sense that the mathematics provides a framework within which those puzzling features somehow arise . it does not address the most puzzling questions : specific questions like `` precisely what might we see happening next ? '' and `` precisely how is what we might see restricted by what we are , or by what we do ? '' . p.c.w. davies , `` quantum fluctuations and life '' quant - ph/0403017 . davies reviews some of the more speculative literature on the relevance of quantum theory to biological processes . in my opinion ( as exemplified in donald 2001 ) , many of the ideas he discusses lack detailed development and have little plausibility . davies himself attempts to apply the uncertainty principle to a couple of situations in biology . this leads him to suggest a maximum time over which a protein can fold and , allowing for a error in his presentation , a minimum velocity for dna base polymerization . both his arguments and his conclusions are misconceived . complex processes involving thousands of atoms can not be modelled as single quantum fluctuations . d.m. appleby , `` facts , values and quanta '' quant - ph/0402015 . appleby discusses some ideas about the nature of probability which are relevant to the understanding of quantum mechanics . he criticizes the idea that probabilities can be thought of simply as long term relative frequencies . he also criticizes orthodox methods in statistics , pointing out that many assumptions are implicit in those methods . he presents some illuminating examples showing how these implicit assumptions are similar to those made explicit by bayesian methods . i disagree with appleby 's view that probability is epistemic and i do not believe that he has made a convincing case against the idea of probabilities as propensities . nevertheless , this is a thought - provoking paper , with much to recommend it , particularly as an introduction to the subject . appleby provides another discussion of these issues in `` probabilities are single - case , or nothing '' quant - ph/0408058 . in `` properties of the frequency operator do not imply the quantum probability postulate '' quant - ph/0409144 , c.m. caves and r. schack mount a much more technical attack on the suggestion that quantum probabilities can be explained in terms of relative frequencies in infinitely repeated trials . appleby criticizes infinitely repeated trials as physically unobtainable . caves and schack show that expressing the same idea in precise mathematical terms requires us to work in a realm radically different from conventional quantum theory . they argue that , in this realm , there are ambiguities in the definition of an infinite - repetition frequency operator which can only be resolved by assuming the conventional definition of quantum probabilities . i agree that probabilities for finite numbers of trials can not be explained by reference to infinite numbers of trials . however , i suspect that all explanations of probability involve some circularity . the laws of large numbers are essential to such explanations . we want to say that we expect to see a fair die showing six about one sixth of the time , but this depends on expecting our observations to be reasonably typical . h. greaves , `` understanding deutsch 's probability in a deterministic multiverse '' quant - ph/0312136 . greaves is concerned by the problem of what probability can mean in a branching universe in which every possible outcome of an experiment actually occurs . she argues that a `` rationality principle '' needs to adopted , requiring that we should care about future branches according to their relative quantum amplitude - squared measures . it is not clear to me that such a principle adds anything to the unsophisticated understanding of probability in such a universe , which requires that we act according to whatever mathematical structure we think defines the probability of branches , in exactly the same way that we would act according to the corresponding structure in a corresponding collapsing theory . the nature of reality may be different in the different scenarios , but it is consistent to assume that the meaning of `` expected experience '' does not change . more pressing questions , in my opinion , may be found by probing the adequacy of the picture that leads greaves to believe that probabilities can be defined by squared amplitudes and , more generally , may be found by trying to understand the nature of the branches and the mathematics of their probabilities . greaves is certainly right to query assumptions which are based on a simplistic model of measurement . m. schlosshauer , `` decoherence , the measurement problem , and interpretations of quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0312059 . this long paper provides an excellent discussion of the relevance of decoherence to the foundations of quantum mechanics . schlosshauer does not examine the details of the theory or of the models which underlie it , but he does give a careful analysis of its implications for several important interpretative programs . g. bacciagaluppi 's entry , `` the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics '' , in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy , provides a much briefer discussion along similar lines . a. bershadskii , e. dremencov , j. bershadskii , and g. yadid , `` brain neurons as quantum computers : in vivo support of background physics '' q - bio . nc/0311026 . experimental evidence is presented for a similarity between scaling properties of moving averages of frequencies of background firings of single neurons in anaesthetized mutant rats and analogous properties of a simple model quantum system exhibiting `` quantum chaos '' . the authors suggest that their results might be relevant to the question of whether , at some level , neurons function as quantum computers . however similarity in behaviour , particularly in systems which differ in many other respects , does not imply similarity of cause . moreover , even if quantum chaos were , somehow , at the root of the background firings , that is hardly indicative of quantum computation . j. eisert , `` exact decoherence to pointer states in free open quantum systems is universal '' quant - ph/0311022 . eisert analyses the wigner function of a free particle linearly coupled to a heat bath of harmonic oscillators and shows that after a sufficiently long time the state of the particle can be represented as a mixture of minimal uncertainly gaussians . this is typical of results in decoherence theory , in that it is shown that , in many circumstances , there are decompositions into quasi - classical states . nevertheless , these decompositions are not uniquely defined . m.a. rubin , `` there is no basis ambiguity in everett quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0310186 . at the core of everett 's original analysis of quantum mechanics is a simple model of a measurement process . in the context of that model , rubin demonstrates that an ambiguity in the decomposition of entangled wavefunctions can be avoided by including information about dynamical structure . this is an interesting result . nevertheless , the model studied is a long way from the realistic situations which need to be considered if we want to show that everett 's ideas can be relevant to real macroscopic observers and their measurements . this means that , at best , rubin 's paper can only be a preliminary step towards a treatment of the preferred basis problem in the extended sense in which it is introduced in my summary , where it is considered as the problem of finding a theory to explain what observable possibilities can arise as a result of realistic `` measurements '' . in `` spatial degrees of freedom in everett quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0511188 , rubin generalizes his model to allow system and observer to have spatial wavefunctions . he also considers correlations between different observers . however , he still assumes that the system and the observers are already identified , that the interactions and the initial wavefunctions take precisely specified and idealized forms , and that the interactions act for precisely specified periods . ( 6/06 ) c. rovelli , `` a dialog on quantum gravity '' hep - th/0310077 . we need to remain sceptical in this era of scientific fashion , when much of theoretical physics has become highly speculative , when it can be hard to distinguish between rival physical theories by direct experimental test , and when theories are often so difficult to analyze that significant questions are left open indefinitely . some of these issues arise even in the foundations of quantum theory where the mathematics is comparatively simple , and in response i have emphasized the weight that should be given to a theory 's overall consistency and lack of vagueness . in quantum gravity , the technical problems are awesome . rovelli compares string theory with loop quantum gravity . his arguments , that string theory has failed as yet to live up to the often extravagant promises of its proponents and that other avenues are also worth exploring , echo the opinions of p. woit in `` string theory : an evaluation '' physics/0102051 . in `` pascual jordan , his contributions to quantum mechanics and his legacy in contemporary local quantum physics '' hep - th/0303241 , b. schroer warns that the monoculture of string theory could lead to the achievements of local quantum field theory being lost . schroer 's paper is an interesting essay on those achievements , emphasizing the goal of an intrinsic formulation of quantum field theory not dependent on starting from the quantization of a classical system . schroer 's biographical notes on pascual jordan are also worth reading . jordan was a brilliant physicist and a nazi . that such a combination is possible is not something we should forget or ignore . r. hedrig provides an introductory review of some more recent critical analyses of string theory in `` string theory - from physics to metaphysics '' physics/0604171 . in particular , he discusses , from a philosophical standpoint , problems with the idea of string theory having a vast number of solutions , one of which is selected anthropically . ( 4/06 ) a. peres , `` einstein , podolsky , rosen , and shannon '' quant - ph/0310010 . the conclusion of this short note is that `` reality may be different for different observers '' . the question of the nature of an observer is left open . m. smerlak and c. rovelli reach the same conclusion in `` relational epr '' quant - ph/0604064 . they suggest that any physical system provides a potential observer , but this still leaves open many fundamental questions about what it is that we are and why our experiences should take the form that they do . ( 5/06 ) l. polley , `` " measurement " as a neurophysical process : a hypothetical linear and deterministic scenario '' quant - ph/0309166 . polley models the opening of a neural ion channel as a configurational tunnel process activated by thermal fluctuations . he argues that in his model the probability of an opening will vary widely between different channels on different occasions . supposing that only neural firing events are `` observed '' , he suggests that this can provide a mechanism for the selection of single observed events from a superposition . however , according to this proposal , the probability of a given observation will be determined entirely by events internal to the observer and so will bear no relation to empirically - measured probability . moreover , as i discuss in donald 1999 , any proposal that only neural firing events are observed will bias the probabilities of observations toward the observation of events causing extensive neural firing . polley 's suggestions about the emergence of agreement between several observers seem to tie the observations of each single individual to the most likely thermal fluctuations in all the brains . j. barrett and a. kent , `` noncontextuality , finite precision measurement and the kochen - specker theorem '' quant - ph/0309017 . the kochen - specker theorem is a beautiful piece of mathematics which rules out certain types of hidden - variable theories . it tells us that we should n't imagine , before we measure a quantum system , that that system has already given a value to all of its projection operators in a way compatible with the mathematics of quantum theory . pitowsky , meyer , and kent were able to side - step the theorem by showing that values could be given to almost all the projection operators . this idea culminates with r. clifton and a. kent `` simulating quantum mechanics by non - contextual hidden variables '' quant - ph/9908031 . clifton and kent 's work has been much discussed , and barrett and kent 's paper is a response to that discussion . an excellent contribution to the discussion is d.m. appleby `` the bell - kochen - specker theorem '' quant - ph/0308114 , in which it is shown that any scheme of the pitowsky - meyer - kent - clifton ( pmkc ) type necessarily involves pathological discontinuities . it would be a mistake to suppose that the pmkc work suggests a way of interpreting quantum theory of even the slightest plausibility . in particular , clifton and kent postulate an occult and inexplicable interaction between measuring device and system which lies entirely outside the quantum theory they are attempting to model . nevertheless , the work is interesting because it probes the strangeness of quantum theory in new and subtle ways . the three papers cited here explain and examine these subtleties clearly , competently , and thoughtfully . w.m. de muynck , `` towards a neo - copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0307235 . de muynck provides an interesting analysis of some of the problems of the copenhagen interpretation , emphasizing distinctions between preparation and measurement and between different notions of completeness . he is explicit about the need for some sort of `` subquantum '' theory to complete his proposed `` neo - copenhagen interpretation '' but he fails to provide such a theory . i do not think that he substantiates his claim to have resolved the problem of non - locality . t. ohsaku , `` the model of the theory of the quantum brain dynamics can be cast on the heisenberg spin hamiltonian '' quant - ph/0306021 . a biologist looking at this brief note would be right to be puzzled by the complete lack of any connection to conventional neurophysiology . j.b. hartle , `` what connects different interpretations of quantum mechanics ? '' quant - ph/0305089 . definite events in quantum theory can easily be represented using projection operators , and compatible sequences of definite events using consistent sequences of projection operators . for this reason , the consistent histories formalism provides a useful preliminary framework for the interpretation of quantum theory and ideas central to several interpretations can be analysed in terms of restrictions of such a framework . i have provided this kind of analysis of my own work in section 7 of donald 1999 . hartle considers the copenhagen interpretation , the bohm interpretation , and the idea of sums over histories . the trouble with the consistent histories formalism however is simply that it is far too general to be anything other than a broad preliminary framework . s. roy and m. kafatos , `` quantum processes , space - time representation and brain dynamics '' quant - ph/0304137 . this worthless paper confuses the geometries of space - time , of hilbert space , of spaces of neural information , and of neural anatomy . the underlying idea would seem to be to attempt quantization at the level of neural information . the fact that a brain is already part of the quantum universe is ignored . r. omn ï¿½ s , `` decoherence , irreversibility and the selection by decoherence of quantum states with definite probabilities '' quant - ph/0304100 . omn ï¿½ s discusses the development of a general theory of decoherence based on a theory of irreversible processes . he investigates situations in which decoherence does not involve the simple diagonalization of a reduced density matrix but in which there is also mixing between components . d.j. berkeland , d.a. raymondson , and v.m. tassin , `` tests for non - randomness in quantum jumps '' physics/0304013 . are quantum events really random ? berkeland , raymondson , and tassin do not find any sign of non - random behaviour in data from long series of atomic transitions . k. hornberger and j.e. sipe , `` collisional decoherence revisited '' quant - ph/0303094 . hornberger and sipe go carefully through several methods of deriving the rate of decoherence of a massive particle due to collisions in a thermal environment . their analysis does not alter the qualitative conclusions of previous approaches but does reveal them to have been in error by a numerical factor . in `` collisional decoherence observed in matter wave interferometry '' quant - ph/0303093 , k. hornberger , s. uttenthaler , b. brezger , l. hackermueller , m. arndt , and a. zeilinger provide an experimental demonstration of decoherence of this kind in the interference of fullerene molecules . in `` decoherence of matter waves by thermal emission of radiation '' quant - ph/0402146 , l. hackermueller , k. hornberger , b. brezger , a. zeilinger , and m. arndt report the observation of the decohering effect of the cooling in flight of hot fullerene molecules . m. tegmark , `` parallel universes '' astro - ph/0302131 . tegmark provides an introductory discussion of four conceivable levels of co - existent physical worlds ; infinite approximately - homogeneous cosmology , in which any possible finite - defined set of circumstances will be repeated in infinitely many places ; chaotic inflation , in which what we think of as physical constants will take different values in different regions ; conventional many - worlds quantum theory ; and the class of all mathematical structures . he points out that if we are prepared to countenance the existence of the first of these levels , then many - worlds quantum theory will essentially add no new worlds . the idea of the fourth level , in the sense of all mathematical structures having equal existence , may seem attractive as a theory apparently involving not only no free parameters , but even no laws . tegmark provides a fuller discussion of this idea in `` is ` the theory of everything ' merely the ultimate ensemble theory ? '' gr - qc/9704009 , but it is not , in my view , an idea which can properly be described as a `` theory '' at all . to start with , there are questions about the definition of the class of mathematical structures which are not answered by the idea that `` mathematical existence is merely freedom from contradiction '' . for example , there are questions about which language is used to express that freedom from contradiction . more importantly , any idea of total `` mathematical democracy '' will be lost as soon as we attempt , as we surely must , to make predictions by defining a probability measure on a set of structures . it is ridiculous to suggest that there is any way that all mathematical structures can be given equal statistical weight ; at least if any structure is to be given any weight at all . tegmark does have some interesting remarks about possible dimensions for space and time in these papers and in `` on the dimensionality of spacetime '' gr - qc/9702052 , but these remarks are based on assuming that close analogs to conventional laws of physics hold uniformly over extended spacetime regions . this is a situation which is appropriately described in the context of his second level of parallel universe in which some over - arching physical laws are assumed . the idea of a `` self - aware substructure '' is central to tegmark 's discussion and is yet another idea that he fails to analyse in any detail . in my own view , the complete formulation of any parallel - universe theory requires the identification of the natural laws which define the self - aware substructures as well as of the physical laws which provide the probabilities for their future experiences . ( 6/06 ) t. brun , `` probability in decoherent histories '' quant - ph/0302034 . brun provides a rather superficial discussion of probabilistic aspects of an undeveloped observer - centered interpretation based on the consistent histories idea . he claims , `` i have argued , i hope convincingly , that quantum mechanics ( and decoherent histories in particular ) can describe the experiences of observers without ambiguity '' . his argument for this point seems to consist almost entirely of the statement , `` the internal state of the robot is a valid observable , so we can choose basis states which are eigenstates of this observable '' . the most important requirement of any interpretation which purports to describe `` observers '' is that it can be demonstrated that the description given can be applied to human beings . for reasons i spell out at length in the core papers on this site -- in particular , the thermal nature of neural states and the mesoscopic scale of neural information processing -- i believe that the suggestion that the internal state of a human being can be described as a valid observable in an unambiguous way is totally wrong . a.m. steinberg , `` speakable and unspeakable , past and future '' quant - ph/0302003 . in the traditional approach to quantum measurement theory , an initial quantum state is prepared , and inferences are made about the probabilities of various observations at a later time . a more time - symmetric formalism , however , is also possible and leads to the idea of `` weak measurements '' . steinberg introduces this idea , considers some of the implications of the formalism , and discusses some relevant experiments . b. d'espagnat , `` a tentative new approach to the schr ï¿½ dinger cat problem '' quant - ph/0301160 . d'espagnat makes an analogy between consciousness and hidden variables in quantum theory . both seem , in some sense , to be markers of aspects of the physical situation , or of the universal wave function , without acting on it . d'espagnat suggests that it is because of decoherence that the states of hidden variables can provide accurate predictions . a central problem for the panpsychistic picture which he sketches would be to explain the level at which individual human consciousness emerges . d'espagnat 's subsequent paper ( `` consciousness and the wigner 's friend problem '' quant - ph/0402121 ) emphasizes difficulties which arise when the existence of more than one mind is taken into account , but does not attempt to address the technical problems of psycho - physical parallelism , and ignores much relevant recent work . s.a. gurvitz , `` quantum description of classical apparatus : zeno effect and decoherence '' quant - ph/0212155 . gurvitz presents a model in which a measuring device is treated quantum mechanically . such models are important in investigating the general issue of whether `` measurement '' is the defining feature of some sort of boundary between quantum and classical realms . they are also relevant to more specific debates about the validity of the projection postulate , as in donald 2001 and donald 2003 . a. peres and d.r. terno , `` quantum information and relativity theory '' quant - ph/0212023 . much of the work on quantum information and communication has used a framework of fixed , finite - dimensional , non - relativistic quantum systems . peres and terno review some of the ideas and problems which might be relevant if special relativity , quantum field theory , and even general relativity were taken into account . although their over - confident pronouncements on the measurement problem are naive and ill - thought - out , they do discuss several important technical issues . s. saunders , `` derivation of the born rule from operational assumptions '' quant - ph/0211138 . w.h. zurek , `` environment - assisted invariance , causality , and probabilities in quantum physics '' quant - ph/0211037 . two papers which use similar techniques to argue for the inevitability of the born rule in the calculation of probabilities for wavefunctions of external quantum systems , appeared in november 2002 on quant - ph . in both cases , so much of the mathematics of hilbert space is assumed however that i feel that it would be more appropriate to refer to `` consistency arguments '' for the rule rather than `` derivations '' of it . saunders assumes the existence of expectation values for experimental results as linear functions defined by the splitting of a wavefunction into distinguishable orthogonal components . he then assumes that the expectation values are invariant under simple unitary mappings on wavefunction and apparatus , which include permutations and phase changes in the components and refinements of the splittings of the components . he justifies these assumptions by claiming that the mappings amount merely to describing the same experiment in different ways . in his slightly earlier paper , zurek provides a better justification for comparable assumptions by relying on the physics of locality . zurek considers a system in contact with an environment in a joint pure state . using a schmidt decomposition for the joint state , zurek assumes that the system has an unknown local wavefunction for which there are probabilities . he argues that these probabilities are invariant under the permutations and phase changes invoked by saunders for the wavefunction of the system , by showing that such changes can be compensated for by corresponding independent changes on the environment which leave the total global state unchanged . zurek 's fine splittings also arise from processes in the environment rather than in the system . m. schlosshauer and a. fine review zurek 's approach and comment on his assumptions in `` on zurek 's derivation of the born rule '' quant - ph/0312058 . h. barnum provides another discussion in `` no - signalling - based version of zurek 's derivation of quantum probabilities '' quant - ph/0312150 and zurek returns to the subject with an extended discussion in `` probabilities from envariance '' quant - ph/0405161 . at the core of the envariance argument is something like the following idea : suppose that , in the usual way , separate observers ( alice and bob ) share a singlet state of two spins . suppose that alice is thinking about measuring her spin in the x - direction . she knows that she will either see an up spin or a down spin and she wants to know how likely each result is . she considers using some device to rotate her spin through 180 degrees about the y - axis . this would mean that she would convert an up x - spin into a down x - spin and a down x - spin into an up x - spin . however , using her knowledge of the mathematics of quantum states , alice notes that if bob were simultaneously to rotate his spin through 180 degrees about the y - axis , then the total singlet state of both spins would be completely unchanged . locality leads alice to deduce that she is as likely to see an up spin as a down spin . this seems quite convincing . it does depend , however , on prior acceptance of the mathematics of quantum states . it also deals only with what is , in my opinion , an unduly limited type of empirical experience in which the local outcomes for alice are defined by a set of locally - decoherent quantum states with orthogonal support projections . when alice considers outcomes involving her own internal states , i believe that more general outcome states need to be considered and that this requires a more general theory of quantum probabilities , as proposed in donald 1992 . c. hewitt - horsman , `` quantum computation and many worlds '' quant - ph/0210204 . working in the incomplete framework of the saunders - wallace approach to the everett interpretation ( which i criticize in donald 2002 ) , hewitt - horsman argues that it is possible to describe a simple theoretical quantum computation using a many - worlds picture . her description involves choosing to refer to as a `` world '' any appropriate substructure which , according to an implicit , uncharacterized , external observer , would have suitable short term stability . in my opinion , because of the artificiality of her concept of a world , hewitt - horsman fails to rebut the more interesting paper by a.m. steane which she discusses . in this paper ( `` a quantum computer only needs one universe '' quant - ph/0003084 ) , steane puts forward some convincing arguments for why it may be misleading to view quantum computers as performing many computations simultaneously . in fact , any real quantum computer would merely be a physical device . its existence might help to persuade us of the general correctness of quantum theory , but it would not directly help to solve the problem of the interpretation of the theory . indeed , in `` copenhagen computation : how i learned to stop worrying and love bohr '' quant - ph/0305088 , n.d. mermin gives a simple description of quantum computation in terms compatible with the copenhagen interpretation . r.b. griffiths , `` probabilities and quantum reality : are there correlata ? '' quant - ph/0209116 . griffiths argues that his consistent histories theory is superior to mermin 's `` ithaca interpretation '' . for most of this paper , as in `` choice of consistent family , and quantum incompatibility '' quant - ph/9708028 , griffiths seems to be describing his own theory as one in which an external observer has complete freedom to choose any `` framework '' ( any consistent set of histories ) to describe any physical system . this makes his claim that his theory describes an objective reality independent of observers quite incomprehensible , unless that objective reality is the reality of the entire set of possible frameworks , which is presumably the reality of a no - collapse interpretation of quantum theory , and is therefore very different from the reality which we apparently observe . towards the end of his paper , however , griffiths suddenly turns around and says that his theory expresses a `` robust realism '' , and that there is a framework which is `` based on projectors representing actual properties of the world '' . he does not tell us how this framework is to be identified or what he means here by `` actual '' , except that he says that `` a single quasi - classical framework suffices for answering all `` classical '' questions about the world '' . he qualifies this statement by saying , `` actually there are many different , mutually incompatible quasi - classical frameworks which yield descriptions which are indistinguishable at the macroscopic level ; for present purposes we can simply think of using one of these . '' in donald 2002 , i have argued that such an unspecific quasi - classical framework does not provide an adequate foundation for a theory of psycho - physical parallelism . in `` some recent developments in the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory '' quant - ph/0301117 , j.j.halliwell reviews some of the ways in which the emergence of classicality can be expressed using a consistent histories formalism . c. anastopoulos discusses the problem of choosing a framework in `` on the selection of preferred consistent sets '' quant - ph/9709051 . he reviews the use of coherent states to construct approximately - consistent quasi - classical frameworks . m.a. rubin , `` relative frequency and probability in the everett interpretation of heisenberg - picture quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0209055 . rubin provides a fairly straightforward analysis of the measurement of relative frequency in an elementary version of the many - worlds formalism . he emphasizes that finite resolution in the measurement of relative frequency is necessary for physical realizability as well as for application of the mathematics of the probabilistic laws of large numbers . i. pitowsky , `` betting on the outcomes of measurements : a bayesian theory of quantum probability '' quant - ph/0208121 . pitowsky considers the constraints which arise when one tries to define probabilities on families of mutually commuting projections on a hilbert space subject to simple consistency rules . this allows him to provide finite models of the uncertainty principle , the kochen - specker theorem , and the violation of bell 's inequality in the context of minimal assumptions about the nature of quantum states as assignments of probabilities . p.k. aravind , `` a simple demonstration of bell 's theorem involving two observers and no probabilities or inequalities '' quant - ph/0206070 . for years there has been a process of development and simplification of thought experiments expressing the non - existence of local hidden variables in quantum theory . by invoking a system with four rather than just two qubits , aravind manages to construct an example which would be particularly striking at the macroscopic level . his example shows two spatially - separated observers ( alice and bob ) able to make a range of tests in such a way that they always appear to get the same result whenever they make the same test , and yet where it is impossible for all the results of all the possible tests to have been fixed in advance . the explanation of the example in terms of the predicted results of specified quantum measurements does not explain how quantum mechanics itself can work . this is why an interpretation of quantum theory is needed . one possibility might be that non - local influences somehow force the compability between alice and bob 's results . the idea i prefer is that there is a second stage of measurement at the time when the results are shared , and that the compatibility of the observations is achieved at this stage , by a process of correlation between alice 's worlds and bob 's , driven by the relations between the states which define those worlds and the initial state of the system . ( 6/06 ) c.a. fuchs , `` quantum mechanics as quantum information ( and only a little more ) '' quant - ph/0205039 . fuchs begins this paper by dismissing all serious attempts to understand the ontology of the quantum formalism as quasi - religious zealotry . while i agree that excessive conviction can indeed be a problem , it is however only when a rational , consistent , and complete description of reality is attempted that an interpretation can be destroyed , as , for example , facts about the eigenfunctions of reduced density matrices destroy the modal interpretation ; the set selection problem destroys consistent histories ; and the formalism of relativistic quantum field theory destroys the bohm interpretation . fuchs 's pious hope is that salvation will come if we can only find the right slogans , and his claim is that those slogans will be something to do with information . despite this silly beginning , the remainder of this long paper fizzes with interesting ideas . first , fuchs argues that quantum information is local and personal , which makes clear just how close his program is to a many - minds view . he then presents and discusses a very simple proof of a version of gleason 's theorem showing that density matrices provide the only way of attaching non - contextual probabilities to positive operator - valued measures on a hilbert space . a related argument allows him to derive the tensor product structure for separate quantum systems . it is debatable however whether such positive operator - valued measures really encapsulate the `` structure of our potential interventions '' into the world , or whether they are merely a very carefully contrived way by which we can sometimes manage to see fairly directly into part of reality 's deep structure . fuchs goes on to present his bayesian approach to quantum measurement . he gives an interesting analysis of certain measurement processes in terms of refinements and readjustments of beliefs about quantum states . he also reviews the quantum de finetti theorem which defines circumstances in which it is appropriate to believe that repeated trials on identical quantum systems can be represented as trials of a probability distribution over repeated quantum states . unfortunately , fuchs 's interesting ideas leave him close to the quagmire of total subjectivity . his suggestion that the hilbert space dimension of the sort of simple quantum system studied in quantum information theory might be something which , in his terms , is not subjective , seems implausible because such simple systems are always state and context dependent idealizations . in my opinion , the existence of objective physical laws and also of some sort of objective initial quantum state , analogous to everett 's `` universal wavefunction '' , are required if the quagmire is to be avoided . n.e. mavromatos , a. mershin , and d.v. nanopoulos , `` qed - cavity model of microtubules implies dissipationless energy transfer and biological quantum teleportation '' quant - ph/0204021 . in a long series of papers , mavromatos and nanopoulos and co - workers have argued for the existence of large scale coherent quantum effects in neural microtubules . in `` theory of brain function , quantum mechanics and superstrings '' hep - ph/9505374 by nanopoulos , and `` a non - critical string ( liouville ) approach to brain microtubules : state vector reduction , memory coding and capacity '' quant - ph/9512021 and `` microtubules : the neuronic system of the neurons ? '' quant - ph/9702003 both by mavromatos and nanopoulos , the proposals involved speculations about string theory and quantum gravity and the formation and evaporation of tiny virtual black holes . in later papers , including `` on quantum mechanical aspects of microtubules '' quant - ph/9708003 , `` quantum mechanics in cell microtubules : wild imagination or realistic possibility ? '' quant - ph/9802063 , both by mavromatos and nanopoulos , `` quantum brain ? '' , quant - ph/0007088 , by mershin , nanopoulos , and e.m.c. skoulakis , and the title paper , the speculations are about coherent cavity modes within the microtubules interacting with the dimer structure of the tubulin subunits . the consequences are supposed to be the emergence of soliton coherent states which can transfer energy without loss ; and allow macroscopic entanglements , quantum teleportation , and quantum holography ; and can somehow perform quantum computations and thus , somehow , solve various , not very clearly specified , supposed problems . i am dubious about these speculative proposed physical mechanisms and about the existence of the solitons and about all their supposed consequences , but i am especially dubious about the idea that any serious form of quantum computation takes place in a functioning brain . decoherence in the warm wet brain is the effect of the unavoidable exchange of energy between the enormous variety of available modes of excitation . in particular , both through their polarization charges and through their physical momenta , any motion of water or of tubulin will inevitably affect and be affected by their surroundings on the vibrational mode timescales of 10^{-13 } seconds . the fact that the tubulin subunit itself has a molecular weight of 55 kdalton , and therefore has thousands of thermally active degrees of freedom , makes it difficult to believe that it is reasonable to model any aspect of its behaviour by an isolated qubit . even if the solitons were actually to exist , they would be macroscopic quasi - classical waves , rather than probability amplitude waves . serious quantum computation requires the ability to control and manipulate arbitrary superpositions within a large space of quantum wavefunctions . there is no evidence of biological mechanisms for such control and manipulation , at any level . neural systems have evolved with sensory inputs defined by quasi - classical neural firings and muscular responses determined by quasi - classical neural firings , with control mechanisms provided by changes in synaptic connectivities . microtubules have evolved as cellular support and transport systems . it would indeed be remarkable if there also turned out to be a significant apparatus of microtubular quantum information processing which generations of microbiologists had somehow failed to notice . s.l. adler , `` why decoherence has not solved the measurement problem : a response to p.w. anderson '' quant - ph/0112095 . there are two senses in which environmental decoherence theory might be thought to have solved the measurement problem . one sense is in the context of the many - worlds idea , and supposes that decoherence is sufficient to identify a splitting of the universal quantum state into observed quasi - classical parts . i dispute this claim elsewhere in this site . adler , by contrast , disputes the claim in the ridiculously strong sense that decoherence somehow could even solve the measurement problem without any sort of many - worlds assumption . h.p. stapp , `` the basis problem in many - worlds theories '' quant - ph/0110148 . stapp reviews some of the well - known problems with the simplistic idea of a many - worlds theory which depends on a specific preferred orthonormal basis . s.m. hitchcock , `` ` photosynthetic ' quantum computers ? '' quant - ph/0108087 . using an extremely weak definition of a `` quantum computer '' , hitchcock argues that biological processes like photosynthesis , which can be viewed , in some sense , as `` information processing '' and which require quantum mechanics for a complete description , are `` quantum computers '' . however , if we wish to invoke the properties of quantum computers which can make them more efficient as information processors than conventional computers , then it is necessary to use a much stronger definition . in particular , control over a broad range of manipulations at the level of individual quantum states is certainly required . `` genuine '' quantum computation has been the subject of a huge number of theoretical papers of which `` basic concepts in quantum computation '' quant - ph/0011013 by a. ekert , p. hayden , and h. inamori is a good example . these papers tell us what sort of information processing techniques would become possible if we could only somehow manage to get sufficient control at the appropriate level . the most important lesson from such papers for those wishing to invoke quantum computation in biological systems is that , whatever the implementation difficulties , quantum computation would not be magic and does not obviously bring anything new to the mind - body debate . in `` the physical implementation of quantum computation '' quant - ph/0002077 , d.p. divincenzo discusses five requirements for the implementation of genuine quantum computation . these requirements are not met by any biological system . indeed , in `` quantum computing : a view from the enemy camp '' , cond - mat/0110326 , m.i. dyakonov makes a plausible case that , even given the possibility of error correction , the requirements on control of individual qubits are so difficult to meet by any means that no large scale quantum computer will be built in the forseeable future , if ever . however , dyakonov 's statement that he did not share the hope that the factorization of 15 would be achieved by a quantum computer within twenty years was unfortunate , as publication of that achievement came within three months of his paper in `` experimental realization of shor 's quantum factoring algorithm using nuclear magnetic resonance '' by l.m.k. vandersypen , m. steffen , g. breyta , c.s. yannoni , m. h. sherwood , and i.l. chuang , quant - ph/0112176 . nevertheless , although this demonstration that 15 equals 3 times 5 was an experimental triumph , its very difficulty perhaps does more to affirm than to deny dyakonov 's main conclusions . in fact , dyakonov suggests that nmr techniques can not amount to genuine quantum computing . this is to some extent just a question of terminology , but there are significant arguments on both sides . ( for an excellent introduction to nmr quantum computing from first principles , see r. laflamme , e. knill , d.g. cory , e.m. fortunato , t. havel , c. miquel , r. martinez , c. negrevergne , g. ortiz , m.a. pravia , y. sharf , s. sinha , r. somma , and l. viola , `` introduction to nmr quantum information processing '' quant - ph/0207172 . i would also recommend `` quantum computing and nuclear magnetic resonance '' by j.a. jones , quant - ph/0106067 . ) as far as the question of the possible existence of biological quantum computing is concerned , we had better assume that nmr quantum computing is genuine , as it can be done at room temperature and in liquid systems . also the theoretical question of whether the process scales satisfactorily in the limit of arbitrarily many qubits is hardly of relevance for a specific finite biological system . ultimately however the nature of the physical apparatuses required to make nmr quantum computing work shows why biological systems could not have evolved such techniques or anything similar . the relative isolation of nuclear spins from environmental influences is essential , but at the same time that very isolation makes it difficult to manipulate and to read the states of those spins . biological systems obviously do not contain 11.7 telsa magnets , but the necessity for nmr quantum computing of a whole variety of precisely tuned radio - frequency pulses is a much clearer indication that the biological evolution of any such system is impossible . evolution only tunes something that is already producing some sort of biological benefit . the evolution of photosynthetic light harvesting is an excellent example of benefit - driven biological fine - tuning at a quantum level . ( see , `` robustness and optimality of light harvesting in cyanobacterial photosystem i '' by m.k. sener , d. lu , t. ritz , s. park , p. fromme , and k. schulten physics/0207070 . ) both hitchcock , in the title paper for this item , and b. lovett , j.h. reina , a. nazir , b. kothari , and a. briggs in `` resonant transfer of excitons and quantum computation '' quant - ph/0209078 have proposed that components of suitable light harvesting systems could be used in manufactured quantum computers . the essential fact , however , remains that for a biological organism , the benefit of a quantum computation would be the result of the computation . the ability rapidly to factor large integers would not help a plant to survive in the jungle , but even if it did , no path to an evolved number - factoring quantum computer could exist because there are so many easier ways to factor small numbers . an example of a problem which does have biological relevance is that of database searching . for searching unstructured databases , l.k. grover has developed a well - known quantum algorithm . nevertheless , although he gave a pivotal paper , quant - ph/9706033 , the title `` quantum mechanics helps in searching for a needle in a haystack '' , he does not in fact explain how real grass stalks should be shifted . more significantly , he does not analyse the complexity of the search query . in `` could grover 's quantum algorithm help in searching an actual database ? '' quant - ph/9901068 c. zalka draws attention to the benefits of classical parallel processing in database searching and to the artificiality of the assumption of an unstructured database . these issues would both be relevant in biological systems . the question of whether , if quantum computers could be build , grover 's method would give any practical advantage over conventional computers is investigated further by g.f. viamontes , i.l. markov , and j.p. hayes in `` is quantum search practical ? '' quant - ph/0405001 . they argue that no answer can be given without an analysis of the structure of specific search problems and of specific methods for solving those problems . in the biological domain , similar specific analyses should also be required from those who suggest that biological quantum computation could have evolved and that consciousness could depend on it . demonstrating what is currently possible , m. s. anwar , d. blazina , h. carteret , s. b. duckett , and j. a. jones construct an nmr quantum computer which uses grover 's algorithm to find one needle in a total of four stalks in `` implementing grover 's quantum search on a para - hydrogen based pure state nmr quantum computer '' quant - ph/0407091 . d. wallace , `` everett and structure '' quant - ph/0107144 . wallace argues that everett worlds are simply emergent patterns . he claims that they are merely objects of observation , and that there is no more need , at a fundamental level , to provide an exact specification of them and their dynamics than there is to characterize tigers and their behaviour in terms of the motions of individual atoms . however , although zoological classification may reasonably be seen as reflecting human interests , superficial references to decoherence hardly suffice to reduce the physics of observation to psychology . the application of the philosophy of functionalism in a many - worlds picture requires that `` function '' be identified , not by a presupposed human observer , but starting from the universal wavefunction and the universal hamiltonian . even in the context of decoherence , there is an endless range of possible patterns out there to which , like faces seen in the flames , function might be ascribed . indeed , there is even a vast range of kinds of pattern . the patterns that encompass human functioning do not seem to emerge from the bare mathematics of the quantum formalism in any obvious or immediate fashion . in `` quantum probability from subjective likelihood '' quant - ph/0312157 , wallace makes a similar attempt to reduce probability to psychology . he succeeds in expressing a particularly simple set of assumptions which lead to the assignment of born probabilities to events characterized by a fixed sequence of orthogonal projections . however , when it comes to assigning probabilities to events , such as the physical correlates of distinct individual thoughts , which require a different and more sophisticated delineation , he simply abandons the task . even if i take a subjective view of probablity or even if i am unable to quantify my objective futures , if all i hear of the results of a die throw are the word `` heads '' if a six is thrown and `` tails '' otherwise , i would be wrong to assume that a fair coin has been tossed , and i can expect to become increasingly sure of my error if the situation is repeated sufficiently often . a theory of probabilities can not be achieved without an analysis of events . c.m. caves , c.a. fuchs , and r. schack , `` quantum probabilities as bayesian probabilities '' quant - ph/0106133 . caves , fuchs , and schack argue that quantum states are states of belief defined for individual observers . they require that beliefs be constrained by consistency in betting behaviour , and they invoke gleason 's theorem to produce the standard mathematics of quantum theory . as with many discussions of bayesian interpretations of quantum probability , a problem with this paper is that there is a blurring between the idea of purely subjective probabilities , in which a person 's probabilities have to be consistent but otherwise can be anything that individual chooses ; and the idea of knowledge - based observer - dependent probabilities , in which an individual 's probabilities are what he should rationally choose given everything he knows . the latter seems to me to improve on the former , but requires analysis of what constitutes knowledge and of why some probabilities would be rational . i have proposed a theory of observer - dependent propensities , in which objective observer - dependent probabilities , defined by physical laws , exist , whether or not we are actually aware of them . this is based on the analysis of probabilities in terms of sequences of fundamental observer - defining random events . because caves , fuchs , and schack do not analyse knowledge or observers , their theory should be seen as useful rather than fundamental . this means that it is unnecessary for them to avoid invoking ideas such as the `` probability of a probability '' or the `` probability of an unknown quantum state '' . in `` subjective and objective probabilities in quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0501009 , m. srednicki argues for the utility of such ideas in a bayesian framework . c.a. fuchs , `` notes on a paulian idea : foundational , historical , anecdotal and forward - looking thoughts on the quantum '' quant - ph/0105039 . this is a rambling collection of letters and e - mails written between 1995 and 2001 by chris fuchs to a wide circle of colleagues . in his friendly , enthusiastic , opinionated style , fuchs thinks out loud about quantum theory and its meaning . lots of fun to dip into , to learn from , and to disagree with . sequels are available from his web site . c. simon , v. buzek , and n. gisin , `` the no - signaling condition and quantum dynamics '' quant - ph/0102125 . quantum theory and empirical results derived from it appear to tell us that there are situations in which one experimenter , `` alice '' , can find out about the genuinely random outcome of observations made by a distant colleague , `` bob '' , simultaneously with his observation , but without there having been anything in bob 's laboratory which predetermined his result , or any message of any kind passed between the laboratories at the time of the observations . assuming standard ideas about quantum observables and probabilities , simon , buzek , and gisin argue that such `` spooky actions at a distance '' can only be compatible with the impossibility of superluminal communications as long as the average local dynamics is always given by a linear and completely positive map . l. hardy , `` quantum theory from five reasonable axioms '' quant - ph/0101012 . hardy supposes that certain physical systems can be prepared in identifiable replicable states and that measurements made on those states have a finite range of outcomes with determinable probabilities . he supposes that the probabilities for any measurement can be determined from some given minimum number of appropriately chosen measurements , and he identifies a state with the probabilities to which it give rise . this gives the set of states a convex structure . hardy then proposes some not unreasonable properties for that structure , and uses these properties to derive the mathematical framework of quantum theory . he provides an introductory account of his ideas in `` why quantum theory ? '' quant - ph/0111068 hardy 's work is impressive . like so much work on quantum measurement theory , however , it depends on an entirely external view of quantum systems . thus , there is no acknowledgement of the fact that the measuring devices used are themselves also quantum systems . from the point of view of my proposed many - minds interpretation , the fundamental change in a quantum measurement is not from an external quantum state to an observed outcome , but from one experienced quantum state to another . in this context , hardy 's results can be seen as a derivation of the framework of quantum theory from a set of plausible assumptions about one particularly simple class of physical investigations , and his work is not incompatible with the set of axioms for a more fundamental type of quantum probability proposed in donald 1992 which takes that framework as given . in `` quantum theory from four of hardy 's axioms '' quant - ph/0210017 , r. schack argues that hardy 's probabilities can be interpreted in bayesian terms . b. rosenblum and f. kuttner , `` the observer in the quantum experiment '' quant - ph/0011086 . this is an introductory account of the sort of experiment which has led people to consider that observers may have a significant role in quantum mechanics . rosenblum and kuttner sketch several ways in which their thought experiments might be interpreted . i would say that , in each experiment , each of us individually encounters a set of possibilities . this set , and the probabilities for each of its elements of our finding ourselves observing that element at the end of the encounter , are determined by physical laws , by our physical natures , and by our prior histories ; which include our observations of the outcomes of previous encounters , as well as of the setup of the experiment . ( 5/06 ) r. schack , t.a. brun , and c.m. caves , `` quantum bayes rule '' quant - ph/0008113 . schack , brun , and caves use conventional formalism for quantum measurements to derive a method of updating beliefs about quantum states in the light of measured information . under suitable conditions , they show that this method is precisely analogous to bayesian updating in classical probability theory . they argue against naive use of maximum entropy methods but do not mention relative entropy . f.j. tipler , `` does quantum nonlocality exist ? bell 's theorem and the many - worlds interpretation '' quant - ph/0003146 . tipler argues that the problem of non - locality in quantum theory can be eliminated in a many - worlds interpretation . the crucial point is that for correlations between the results of measurements at spacelike separated regions to be observed , the results need to be compared at a single locality . this point is also emphasized by c.g. timpson and h.r. brown in `` entanglement and relativity '' quant - ph/0212140 , which provides a brief review of the relations between entanglement , non - locality , and bell 's inequality . r. w. spekkens and j. e. sipe `` non - orthogonal preferred projectors for modal interpretations of quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0003092 . spekkens and sipe take a fresh look at modal interpretations , for which they provide a useful introduction and review . one novelty in their approach is that they allow for differences in ontology depending on the results of measurements . i believe that a related requirement ought to be expressed in many interpretations of quantum theory . indeed , this is one of the reasons why i think that , in many - world interpretations , `` worlds '' need to be observer - dependent . spekkens and sipe go on to propose that preferred decompositions of the universal wavefunction be identified by minimizing an entropy function . this is an interesting idea , although , in as far as their proposal merely generalizes the schmidt decomposition , it inherits that decomposition 's problems , including instability under small changes of global wavefunction and under small changes in hilbert space factorization . spekkens and sipe 's assumption of a distinguished factorization seems to me to be highly implausible . c.m. caves , `` predicting future duration from present age : a critical assessment '' astro - ph/0001414 . it is all too easy to make mistakes in probability theory . for example , one might suppose that one could estimate human life expectancy by taking a random sample of the people living at some moment and waiting to discover their ages when they die . such a sample , however , would be very likely to be under - weight in short - lived individuals . caves provides a thorough analysis of a range of related issues as he investigates the problems with a suggestion that it might be possible to make universal probabilistic predictions about how long a phenomenon will last , based only on knowing how long it has already lasted at the instant when one happens to stumble across it . r. clifton and h. halvorson , `` entanglement and open systems in algebraic quantum field theory '' quant - ph/0001107 . tragically , rob clifton died in july 2002 at the age of 38 . he was one of the small community of philosophers of science with a truly extensive knowledge and understanding of the mathematical formalism of quantum theory . in this paper , written for that community , clifton and halvorson explain how the nature of quantum states changes and how entanglement becomes ubiquitous when we move from the mathematics of non - relativistic quantum mechanics to that of local relativistic quantum field theory . d. buchholz and r. haag , `` the quest for understanding in relativistic quantum physics '' hep - th/9910243 . buchholz and haag give a rapid survey of the development of a mathematical understanding of relativistic quantum field theory . buchholz provides a rather less abstract discussion , with more emphasis on recent work , in `` algebraic quantum field theory : a status report '' math - ph/0011044 . the idea of local algebras , and the relations between them , are central in this approach to quantum field theory . in my opinion , the states on these algebras ultimately have more physical relevance and should have a more significant role in the interpretation of quantum theory , than pure state wavefunctions . although wavefunctions are at the heart of the formalism of the conventional interpretation , they can only be fundamental in non - relativistic zero - temperature models or at the level of the entire global hilbert space . h.d. zeh , `` the problem of conscious observation in quantum mechanical description '' quant - ph/9908084 . in this thoughtful paper , originally published in 1981 , zeh provided the first explicit published analysis of the everett interpretation as a many - minds interpretation , or , as he then referred to it , a `` multi - consciousness interpretation '' . m. tegmark , `` the importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes '' quant - ph/9907009 . using somewhat crude analyses , tegmark produces numerical estimates of decoherence timescales for certain mechanisms acting on certain superpositions within the brain . whether this is more convincing than a broad physical understanding of how and on what timescale one charge or ionic or molecular movement in the brain inevitably produces a variety of effects in the surrounding fluid is perhaps a matter of taste . however , despite having recognised the millions of ions which move in response to a single neural firing , tegmark then proceeds to discuss a model of perception involving a six dimensional hilbert space ! given that the brain is a hugely complex , warm , wet , dynamic , open system , such simplistic models are surely valueless , as , for example , they assume without argument that states of perception can be modelled by pure states in some unidentified hilbert space and that those pure states can be exactly repeated . in quant - ph/9907052 `` can all neurobiological processes be described by classical physics ? '' , a.m. lisewski responds to tegmark by arguing that the physics of neural processing is ultimately quantum mechanical . this is undeniable , but it misses the point of tegmark 's paper which is to ask whether there can be large scale quantum coherence in the brain . s. hagan , s.r. hameroff , and j.a. tuszynski ( `` quantum computation in brain microtubules ? decoherence and biological feasibility '' quant - ph/0005025 ) respond to tegmark 's paper with a strenuous defence of the penrose - hameroff `` orchestrated objective reduction '' model of quantum computation in neural microtubules . i am actually sceptical about this entire program ; partly because i am not persuaded by any of the motivations for it ; partly because the mechanisms invoked seem biologically superfluous ; and partly because empirical evidence for those mechanisms seems , at least so far , to be lacking . the strongest argument in the paper is that the specific superpositions ruled out by tegmark are not those claimed in the model . hagan , hameroff , and tuszynski also speculate about ways in which the quantum coherences they require might be protected . if these speculations are to be convincing , however , then ultimately they will have to be presented in much more detail . moreover , when they suggest the existence of quantum error correction , they will ultimately need to explain how such error correction could have evolved . indeed , in my opinion , explaining the evolution of any form of quantum computation is a crucial stumbling block for any proposal invoking it in a biological system . mother nature works with the technology of the day constantly demanding useful improvements in function ; she has no time for blue skies research . wings can evolve because even a little flight -- a long jump -- is useful . eyes can evolve because even a little sight -- shadow detection -- is useful . a little quantum computation , however , is just a very expensive ordinary computation . there are a couple of serious flaws in the hagan , hameroff , tuszynski paper . one of the ways in which tegmark 's analyses are `` crude '' is that he neglects the difference between the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum and that of the neural medium . hagan , hameroff , and tuszynski point out that the medium 's dielectric constant may be quite high , but fail to notice that this is precisely because the medium , considered as an environment , is sensitive to the movement of charges and therefore is itself decohering . to argue for decoherence , it is only necessary to demonstrate one decohering mechanism , but coherence requires that every such mechanism be excluded . even ordered water will have its modes of excitation . hagan , hameroff , and tuszynski also criticize the temperature dependence of tegmark 's formulas without giving any explanation of what they think is wrong with the velocity dependence of the rutherford scattering cross section . in the context of the strong interactions in the interior of a material system , the intuition that local decoherence is an effect of high rather than low temperatures is certainly arguable . the singlet state , for example , is typical of ground states in combining global coherence with decoherence of the substates of individual constituents . d. deutsch , `` quantum theory of probability and decisions '' quant - ph/9906015 . probability theory was invented so that gamblers could decide whether or not accepting any given bet would be sensible in the long term . conversely , a gambler who knows exactly what bets would be sensible in the long term can use that knowledge to calculate the probabilities of the events on which he is betting . decision theory gives us a general framework within which any complete rational scheme of preferences for acts implies probabilities for the possible outcomes of those acts . deutsch uses structures and symmetries of quantum mechanics to argue that any rational scheme of preferences governed by quantum theory should imply standard quantum probabilities . his arguments are criticized by h. barnum , c. m. caves , j. finkelstein , c. a. fuchs , and r. schack in `` quantum probability from decision theory ? '' quant - ph/9907024 . in `` quantum probability and decision theory , revisited '' quant - ph/0211104 , d. wallace provides an introduction to decision theory and extends and revises deutsch 's analysis . a shorter version of wallace 's paper is `` everettian rationality : defending deutsch 's approach to probability in the everett interpretation '' quant - ph/0303050 . by constructing an unphysical counter - example in `` on the everett programme and the born rule '' quant - ph/0505059 , p. van esch shows the necessity of some of the assumptions made in the analysis ; for example , assumptions about the equivalence of certain procedures . deutsch and wallace both make extravagant claims for the significance of decision theory . it is certainly the case that the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics makes the born rule by far the most plausible way of calculating objective probabilities for those external events which have objective probabilities and which can accurately be characterized by projection operators . decision theory does provide some sort of framework for this argument , but it does not solve any of the deeper conceptual or technical problems . for a gambler , knowing the odds may or may not be straightforward , but what he really wants to know is whether he is going to be lucky . physicists , on the other hand , already know that it is rational to expect to be typical . their problems are to understand the nature of the events to which probabilities should be attached , and to discover what sets of events should be thought to be typical by constructing convincing theories which adequately encapsulate what has been learnt from the past . in `` what is probability ? '' quant - ph/0412194 , s. saunders introduces the decision theory approach . a wide - ranging exploration of the nature of quantum probability , saunders ' paper is full of interesting ideas and suggestions . however , for reaons which i explained in donald 2002 , i believe that saunders is wrong to suppose that decoherence theory provides a sufficiently unambiguous branching structure to underlie the emergence of probability . i also think that a framework in which measurement is modelled as the measurement of a disjoint family of projection operators is not adequate for describing all physical observations . d. deutsch and p. hayden , `` information flow in entangled quantum systems '' quant - ph/9906007 . in this intriguing paper , deutsch and hayden analyse information flow in quantum mechanics in terms of local changes in heisenberg operators . their approach has some similarities with the theory of local algebras , which is used in algebraic quantum field theory to express the locality of relativistic interactions . deutsch and hayden , however , consider only short term developments of finite - dimensional systems with interactions defined by quantum computational gates . focusing on changes in operators , and essentially ignoring local states and observed information , they attempt to argue that `` a complete description of a composite system can always be deduced from complete descriptions of its subsystems '' . this leads them to posit the rather convoluted idea of local but locally - inaccessible information . i suspect that , without the introduction of observed information , all information in their terms would become locally - inaccessible on cosmological time scales . c.g. timpson discusses the paper in `` nonlocality and information flow : the approach of deutsch and hayden '' quant - ph/0312155 . y.h. kim and y. shih , `` experimental realization of popper 's experiment : violation of the uncertainty principle ? '' quant - ph/9905039 . in 1934 , even before the famous einstein - podolsky - rosen paper , karl popper considered whether it was possible from measurements of one of a pair of interacting particles to infer properties of the other . popper subsequently realized that there were serious problems with his initial discussion , but many years later he proposed a related experiment . a version of this has been performed by kim and shih . in this experiment , pairs of correlated photons head in opposite directions . on one side of the experiment the photons meet a slit . popper claimed that the uncertainty principle implies that the partners of those which pass through should scatter as if there were slits on both sides , on the grounds that what we learn about one of a pair we then know about its partner . he predicted that this would not be what is observed . his prediction was confirmed , but he was wrong to suggest that this contradicted quantum theory . a. peres points out in `` popper 's experiment and the copenhagen interpretation '' quant - ph/9910078 , that popper 's reasoning is unacceptable because it depends on the counterfactual idea of where the partner particle would have been at a time when it was not being observed . detailed treatments of the situation which explain the experimental results in quantum theoretical terms have been given by t. qureshi in `` popper 's experiment , copenhagen interpretation and nonlocality '' quant - ph/0301123 , `` understanding popper 's experiment '' quant - ph/0405057 , and `` on the realization of popper 's experiment '' quant - ph/0505158 , and by a. bramon and r. escribano in `` popper 's test of quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0501134 and `` popper 's test of quantum mechanics and two - photon " ghost " diffraction '' quant - ph/0507040 . u. mohrhoff , `` the pondicherry interpretation of quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/9903051 . mohrhoff claims that problems with quantum mechanics arise because we try to impose a conceptual framework that is more detailed than the actual world . for example , he says that einstein - podolsky - rosen correlations are no problem because , `` at a fundamental level , ` here ' and ` there ' are the same place '' . he argues that reality is built on `` facts '' and says that , `` the actually existing spatial distinctions are those that are warranted by facts '' . this is by no means entirely implausible , but the trouble is that mohrhoff does not provide any characterization of the nature of `` facts '' . `` clicks '' are apparently `` facts '' ( u. mohrhoff , `` making sense of a world of clicks '' quant - ph/0202148 ) , but it is not made clear whether a click is supposed to be the movement of a loudspeaker , or the longitudinal wave to which it give rise , or some eigenstate of some operator defined by the situation , or indeed whether there is supposed to be any relation between the click and what is conventionally taken to be its underlying physics . just leaving us to imagine that we know a fact when we see one is not giving us an explanation of anything and is missing the point of most technical work on the interpretation of quantum theory . in `` quantum mechanics and consciousness : fact and fiction '' quant - ph/0102047 , mohrhoff expresses his annoyance at consciousness being dragged into discussions of physics . the reason that it has been brought in , however , is just that consciousness does appear to form a natural and ultimate division between possibilities and facts . the idea is that the least detailed framework compatible with our observations should be a framework defined by mental `` facts '' . even this idea , however , does still require us to provide a characterization of the nature and temporal development of mental facts . mohrhoff 's work is discussed by l. marchildon in `` remarks on mohrhoff 's interpretation of quantum mechanics '' quant - ph/0303170 . w.h. zurek , `` decoherence , einselection , and the existential interpretation ( the rough guide ) '' quant - ph/9805065 . zurek reviews his analysis of the existence of comparatively stable `` pointer states '' for quantum systems in contact with suitable environments . although , in general , these states can not be uniquely defined , they can , to a good approximation , be reproducibly observed without disturbance ; for example , by looking ( perhaps literally ) at the environment . this is interesting and significant work , based on a wide variety of detailed models . however , it remains phenomenological . zurek 's identification of `` pointer states for neurons '' is approximate and depends on how those states would behave under investigation by external observers or over extended time periods . while this is certainly useful in explaining the externally - observed functioning of neurons for practical purposes , it is , in my opinion , a long way from what is required for the foundation of a fundamental interpretation of quantum theory . in `` decoherence , einselection , and the quantum origins of the classical '' quant - ph/0105127 , zurek provides another and longer review of his work . he suggests that he is providing a new paradigm appropriate for textbooks on quantum theory . i have no doubt that serious students of the subject will learn much from his papers , but there are many questions , in particular those raised in donald 2002 , which they do not answer . if we try to analyse the detailed real - time functioning of an individual human brain for itself , there is considerable ambiguity as to the precise scales on which information is being experienced and as to the precise physical structures which represent that information . these ambiguities can not be resolved by looking for the existence at longer time scales of less detailed information ; whether in entitities external to the brain or in subsequent memory traces . in `` emergence of objective properties from subjective quantum states : environment as a witness '' quant - ph/0307229 and `` environment as a witness : selective proliferation of information and emergence of objectivity '' quant - ph/0408125 , h. ollivier , d. poulin , and w.h. zurek investigate and model the mirroring of multiple redundant copies of certain information out of a quantum system into the environment of that system . c. kiefer and e. joos , `` decoherence : concepts and examples '' quant - ph/9803052 . kiefer and joos give a brief sketch of the theory of decoherence . a brief philosophical analysis is given by h.d. zeh in `` what is achieved by decoherence ? '' quant - ph/9610014 . another discussion of the same material is given by e. joos in `` elements of environmental decoherence '' quant - ph/9908008 . `` decoherence and the transition from quantum to classical -- revisited '' quant - ph/0306072 by w.h. zurek is an update of an introduction to decoherence theory which appeared in 1991 in physics today . zurek has added comments on some more recent theoretical work , mainly by himself and his collaborators , and he also refers to some recent experimental results . m. tegmark , `` the interpretation of quantum mechanics : many worlds or many words ? '' quant - ph/9709032 . an elementary and mainly naive discussion of the many - worlds interpretation . tegmark suggests that decoherence theory has solved the outstanding problems of the interpretation ; a suggestion which i dispute at length elsewhere in this site . tegmark also suggests that by performing many repetitions of a version of the schroedinger cat experiment with oneself as the cat , one would be able to distinguish between the many - worlds interpretation and the copenhagen interpretation . while the question of observer effects in a many - minds interpretation is a complicated and highly technical one , the idea that , because an individual will not be aware of his own death , he need not treat it as a possibility is simply absurd . a. kent , `` against many - worlds interpretations '' gr - qc/9703089 . in this 1990 paper , kent argues forcefully and correctly that various elementary versions of the many - worlds idea are incomplete . r. geroch , `` suggestions for giving talks '' gr - qc/9703019 . really bad talks are given by people who do n't understand their subject . these are rare . ordinary bad talks are given by people who overestimate their audience 's knowledge and underestimate their own . these are common . we all endure listening to such talks , each assuming that we are alone in not being able to follow . also common are talks in which we are given no reason to care about what is being said . the situation would improve , if , as speakers , we were all to act on geroch 's excellent advice . although directed at relativists , his suggestions are universally applicable . l. vaidman , `` on schizophrenic experiences of the neutron or why we should believe in the many - worlds interpretation of quantum theory '' quant - ph/9609006 . an introductory account of the many - worlds ( or many - minds ) idea at an elementary level . the problem with the paper is the assumption , without detailed definition , of the existence of sentient observers . given those observers , vaidman supposes that a local , decoherent , preferred basis can be defined and that probabilities can be explained as ignorance probabilities . m. tegmark , `` does the universe in fact contain almost no information ? '' quant - ph/9603008 . tegmark argues that in a many - worlds ( or many - minds ) interpretation , it is possible for the universal wave - function ( or universal quantum state ) , to be a simple state ( for example , the vacuum state of some `` theory of everything '' ) with the complexities we see around us being a result of how that state is observed from our subjective points of view . d.n. page , `` sensible quantum mechanics : are only perceptions probabilistic ? '' quant - ph/9506010 . page sketches a tedious series of broad proposals for variants of a type of many - minds ( or `` many - perceptions '' ) interpretation . he either ignores , chooses to repudiate , or gives completely vague answers for , all the most difficult issues ; including the nature of psycho - physical parallelism and the way in which minds develop in time . the shortened version of this paper ( `` sensible quantum mechanics : are probabilities only in the mind ? '' gr - qc/9507024 ) still does not address the difficult issues , but it is much more readable and it does have a few interesting remarks . a later version with more introductory material is `` mindless sensationalism : a quantum framework for consciousness '' quant - ph/0108039 . f. dowker and a. kent , `` on the consistent histories approach to quantum mechanics '' gr - qc/9412067 . in this superb paper , dowker and kent provide a thorough critical analysis of consistent histories formalisms . they argue convincingly that any such formalism could , at best , form only part of a complete interpretation of quantum mechanics . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * notes on some relevant , or significant , or recommended_vbn _ _ ijebuman 's diary the online ramblings of an ijebu man in london home | profile | my travel photoblog | linxs | email thursday , april 28 , 2005 need to relax and take a breeaak , lifes too short .... in the news today : ' british election a week away ' what difference does it make , labour , tories or libdems , all lying politicians , anyway i 'm not around so at least that s my excuse for not voting ... nice quote : " learn from yesterday , live for today , hope for tomorrow .

i guess there lays the mysterious allure that makes you wonder just what could be on the grooves inside . here main man gilbert artman ( on arp synth , organ , piano , vibes and drums ) again assembled a completely new backing group , with yves lanes ( ems synth ) , xavier baulleret ( guitar ) and jean - pierre thiraut ( clarinet ) filling out the textures . the resulting music sounds like it would have been difficult to perform live , and was presumably a studio - only creation . i 'd love to know if lard free was still playing as a live group by this point ; certainly the previous album also suggests a turn to being studio - bound , but that was a bit easier to picture being played live as well . if you recall what i said in the review for ï¿½ i 'm around about midnight ' sounding like the instruments blended together to create a unified whole , it 's even more the case here , so much so that it 's as though artman has conjured up some pan - dimensional sonic entity and has simply pressed record as the genie emerges from its bottle , rather than actually assembled a bunch of human musicians to make an album in a terrestrial studio . ï¿½ spirale malax ' [ 17:12 ] emerges slowly out of silence , taking instant form as the volume increases , as though this music had always existed and is simply continuing as per normal . it 's a fascinating , swirling scramble lattice of synthesizer and electroacoustic sounds of mysterious origin , the only other recognizable instrument so far being looped electric guitar . the whole writhing beast is constantly changing , taking on new forms like some celestial polymorphous chamaeleon , and soon developing the psychic pull of a sonic blackhole , sucking your mind out from between your ears and deep into the cosmic unknown . when i first listened to this , appropriately tripping out of my skull , the dark suction draw was so intense and menacing i had to check the nice photo of artman inside the cd cover to reassure myself from his gentle smile and benevolently sparkling eyes that his intent here was exploratory rather than diabolical . if i was going to get sucked into the chaos of the unknown in this state of mind , i wanted to trust the motives of the navigator , and this guy can pilot my ship of the soul any time . so , if you 're chemically precarious , this is an intense journey but also intensely rewarding if you let go and let it suck you in and swirl you around a bit inside its akashic mind . it 's pretty hard to keep describing this music as it develops , caterpillaring forth like an unstoppable force gathering dread and weight of psychic hubris along the way , propelled not just by the rhythmic processed drum soup that has emerged but by the whole combination of sounds ricocheting in concert but not in unison . after 10 minutes or so some of the heavy layers peel away leaving a tribal drum beat with a more spaced stew of guitar and electronics swimming through the murky air that 's seeping through every pore , pounding forth with staccato fuzz guitar chords and ever - changing tapestries of synthesized sound , a little reminiscent of an imagined more shamanic and daring blend of heldon and spacecraft , with a dash of joakim skogsberg 's more experimental moments , but layered and processed to the nth degree . nearer the end the madness subsides somewhat , leaving the sound of terry riley - like organ loops blending with tribal drums in a nitrous oxide - laden sewer until the gradual fade . ï¿½ synthetic seasons ( parts 1 - 3 ) ' [ 17:23 ] opens with an ominous discordant organ drone running beneath unearthly nightmare electronic bird squalls , as an off - kilter drum pattern gradually emerges mist - shrouded in finely echoed confidence , seemingly misplaced but actually perfectly placed guitar strums occasionally shimmering on one chord , ghostly vibes hanging all around . as the drums fade out the creepiness factor fades in , only for the drums to quickly re - emerge with a different locked groove in an oddly alternating beat , spectral glissando drones and spooky sustained guitar notes still hovering and sliding , as a mesh of further guitar lines emerges , interlocking and arachnoid , adding even more to the aura of alien menace and entrancing psychic disintegration / reintegration that you just ca n't take your eyes and ears off . when the guitars fall back a mesh of piano and vibes comes forth to take its place in the role of matrix - weaver , but before long these too fall away like old scales as everything seeps into a freeform murk of psychedelic intrigue , clarinet emerging to perfect effect and giving the feel of some creepy moment of snooping around somewhere you should n't be in an early 60 's sci - fi / horror b - flick . ( in fact , jean - pierre massiera 's horror vibe album as horrific child comes to mind , another classic waiting for me to review it , as well as some of igor wakhevitch 's amazing 70 's work ) . in the last section , big thrashy guitar chords emerge seamlessly out of the swamp , leading a confident slow - paced two - chord metal riff with frippian guitar soloing almost aimlessly but very effectively over the top , drums meeting the stride , and weird electronic sounds pinging and zinging off the curved walls all around . an awesome way to end the album , stomping off into the tripped - out orange sunset like a strange burly beast from another world that knows it has come , seen and conquered , and could n't care less as it continues its timeless trundle onto fresh brains to fry , all in a day 's work ._. _ _ number of migrants to uk jumps 24 % ashley seager friday june 9 , 2006 the guardian britain experienced the second - biggest inflow of legal migrants of any rich country in 2004 but the numbers staying here over the long term are much lower than government data suggest , the organisation for economic cooperation and development said yesterday . the oecd 's annual international migration outlook said the numbers of immigrants entering in britain leapt 24 % in 2004 , largely due to the eastward enlargement of the european union in may of that year . only britain , sweden and ireland opened their borders to migrants from new member states such as poland . the oecd said the number of long - term migrants in 2004 totalled 266,500 - second only to the us , which saw 946,000 arrive . but the figure for britain is just over half the number of 494,000 long - term migrants that the government said had arrived in britain that year . georges lema ï¿½ tre , of the oecd 's migration division , said the government 's figures included many foreign students who stay only a while . he also said that of the 345,000 workers from eastern europe who registered in britain from may 2004 to the end of 2005 , many did not stay for long . " a lot of migration to britain is short - term and is purely work related . a lot of people from eastern europe stay a while and then return , " he said . the study showed that long - term immigration was also lower than official data suggested in germany , japan and italy . in the united states , canada , australia and new zealand , though , the oecd 's figures are much closer to official data based on work permits or " green " cards . immigration rose fastest in the us in 2004 , up 34 % , the oecd said . italy saw the second - biggest rise , of 28 % or 156,400 . by contrast , immigration into finland dropped by a quarter to 5,600 . germany saw a fall of 15 % to 202,300 , which means britain has overtaken it as the biggest destination for migrants in europe . britain , along with most other oecd countries , saw fewer asylum seekers in 2004 . there were 40,600 claimants in 2004 , just 41 % of the level in 2000 . but in spite of the fall , the uk was third out of the oecd 's 30 members , behind only france on 58,550 and the us on 52,400 . overall , the oecd said that between 3 and 3.5 million immigrants - including those already living in their new country on a temporary basis - acquired official long - term residential status in its member countries in 2004 , up 15 % from 2003 . a home office spokesman said : " workers from the accession states are continuing to come to the uk to fill gaps in the uk labour market - in particular , in construction , agriculture , hospitality and catering , and food - processing industries - and are therefore having a positive effect on the british economy . " but david davis , the shadow home secretary , said : " we are one of the most crowded nations in the developed world . we lie second among industrialised nations in terms of those settling on long - term resident visas , only behind the us , which has much more space than we do . " this is yet another indictment of the government 's policy of unmanaged and uncontrolled immigration .

sponsored scientists . firstly , there is a clear gain in exposure to different approaches and ideas , especially when coupled with access to new expertise and facilities . with this in mind , workshops tend to be targeted towards new areas and areas in which extensive international networks do not already exist . secondly , these workshops can provide contacts and links that are essential for the formation of consortia for accessing other funding sources , such as the eu framework programme . thirdly , there is return in the form of synergy in the generation of new ideas between the participating countries . workshop format experience has shown that there is no set formula for a successful workshop and that there is a need to be flexible according to the needs of the subject area . best practice from previous workshops suggests the following factors : designated leads for different areas , with an overall leader nominated by each side a common sense of purpose communicated in advance to all participants an informal atmosphere , encouraging a full and frank exchange of ideas matching , small numbers of participants ( 5 - 10 ) on each side agreed outcomes designated responsibilities for producing a workshop report and other follow up actions the format usually includes a mixture of seminar - style presentations followed by smaller group discussions and feedback sessions to the whole workshop . workshops are often held within institutes or universities and there may be value in persuading the visiting side to give presentations to larger groups working in the field that are not actually attending the workshop . finally , the wrap - up session is an important element of the workshop , which can be overlooked in the enthusiasm of information exchange . the workshop is about the future and it is essential that enough time is left to prepare an action plan for the way forward . please indicate in your application if you would find it helpful for bbsrc to be represented at the workshop . monitoring and review as a condition of funding , you will be required to submit a formal report of the proceedings within one month of holding the workshop . this report should be prepared by the workshop participants and should include : details of the scope and objectives of the workshop how the workshop was operated details of the participants the main issues covered recommendations on areas of opportunity with details of potential funding sources an action plan of how you plan to take the collaboration forward the report does not need to include extensive details of the scientific discussions - these can remain confidential to the participants to encourage full and frank exchange of information . designated contact if you have any queries about the international workshops scheme , please contact dr kathryn turton ( tel : 01793 413361 or e -

98 , the london school of economics ran a series of darwin seminars to packed lecture theatres . the aim has been to broadcast darwinian ideas and their implications for humans and to give vent to the fermcnt of excitement within modern evolutionary biology . the seminars attracted huge amounts of interest from the media and from members of the public , who trotted along just as they did in victorian times . they lapped up theories about why men prefer women with hourglass figures , why step - children are at greater risk of abuse than natural children and why women suffer sex discrimination . the events acted as a forum for intellectuals from all over the world . and , inevitably , they also aroused antagonism from those who believe the new darwinians exaggerate the claims for natural selection and play into the hands of the political right . last christmas , seminar organiser helena cronin announced that the public events were ceasing . the lse 's darwin forum would devote itself to research , she said . soon questions were being raised about whether it had run out of money , whether it lacked the support of the lse 's new director , anthony giddens , and whether it had fallen foul of a backlash against new darwinism . the answer to each question appears to be no . darwin@lse has not run out of money because it never had much , cronin says . since 1995 , when the seminars began , it has survived on very small sums from benefactors - ï¿½ 1,000 here , ï¿½ 2,000 there . the damon de laszlo foundation has now pledged ï¿½ 20,000 a year as seed money to put things on a proper footing . in the end , cronin decided she could no longer sacrifice her own research and writing to continue to act as a low - paid administrative skivvy . so , darwin@lse has not closed down . but it is , in effect , on hold as the school 's fund - raising machinery cranks into action . giddens says he supports cronin 's work and her role . ' in a place like the lse , which is a social science institution , we have to give attention to developments happening in the natural sciences . in the case of evolutionary theory , there are obvious implications for the other areas that the school covers , so i am very interested in preserving darwinian studies in the lse . " he adds : " i do not see it as purely a personal fiefdom , though . it has to become an institutional part of the lse . ' cronin is so personally tied to new darwinism at the school because she has been the driving force behind it . author of the ant and the peacock , chosen as one of the nine best books of the year by the new york times , she has been able to attract big names from around the world to speak because she has an academic standing of her own . unlike most academics , she is media - friendly , glamorous and articulate - which means she is the butt of resentment from others who are not getting attention . ' academics tend to dislike anyone who is successful in the public marketplace , ' says paul ekman of the university of california at san francisco . ' if you write a book that sells well , there is resentment . ditto , if you generate public lectures and bring a lot of international attention . it has nothing to do with darwin . ' but there is also evidence of a backlash against new darwinism , ekman says . the book by new york times science writer natalie angier , woman : an intimate biography was a frontal assault on the darwinian view of male / female differences . cronin was asked to review the book for the new york times ; she she did so and her critical review was spiked . ' looking at things from an evolutionary perspective in the social and behavioural sciences is still quite a novel activity , ' ekman says . ' stronger intellectual forces come from the hume and locke tradition . there is resentment about the amount of attention that darwin studies seem to have generated . ' now that the seminars are over , cronin is making progress with her book on the evolution of physical and psychological differences between men and women . it will annoy feminists who argue that there are few evolved differences between the sexes . a feminist herself , cronin nonetheless believes that feminism has got itself into a mess by denying the findings of modern science . women and men have evolved to be different , she argues . men are on average more competitive , risk - taking , single - minded , opportunistic , promiscuous and and aware of status than women . with regard to darwin@lse , ekman says : ' my hope is that the seminars will continue but that helena will be able to attract the administrative support , so she will not have to be the one who washes the dishes . the lse has got a lot of attention from this and has put virtually nothing into it . ' because they attracted people from all walks of life - a s byatt and jonathan miller as well as scientists - the seminars made an impact on the intellectual life of britain . some hope they will continue . reproduced by kind permission of the thes . the author has given her permission for use of her work free of charge ._. _ _ if you operate a commercial web site that attracts skiers or snowboarders , you can earn extra revenue by working with snow - line to offer your visitors access to our unique ski holidays search engine . we are interested in working with any of the following sites , provided you are a uk based company or organisation . â¢ specialist skiing or snowboarding organisations â¢ winter sports clothing and equipment â¢ ski or snowboarding clubs â¢ snow reports â¢ holidays & travel â¢ artificial ski slopes we can provide either a personalised link to our site or a customised version of our search engine to be incorporated into your site . our national call centre handles all the bookings , your customers receive customised documentation to your corporate style and you receive a share of the revenue . for more information , contact by e - mail our commercial manager our current affiliates include : â¢ lastminute.com â¢ 1ski.com â¢ deckchair.com â¢ travelocity.co.uk â¢ bargainholidays.com â¢ onlinetravel.com_nnp _ _ click to view lucas 's article in the may 2002 issue of budo international . combat magazine click to view the article " wing chun is about logic not mysticism " as printed in the june 2001 issue of combat magazine . chronicle newspaper click to view the article [ below is the text of the article which appeared in the june 2001 issue of combat . ] also : article from the may 2002 issue of budo international lucas castrounis has a grace and elegance , allied to a youthful complexion , that makes him looks years younger than he is . his physical presence is complimented by an easy wit and charm as he discusses the art of wing chun that he loves . his varied experience has seen him work as a fight choreographer and oversee the door for nightclubs . he currently runs the reading wing chun and kali academy under the auspices of the bikma association , after having studied at " the basement " with nino bernardo . lucas 's dedication and determination is reflected in the way he started again , from scratch , with nino when he felt that his original instruction had been lacking . with an inquiring mind , lucas consistently looks beyond the fighting applications of his art , searching for the conceptual truths behind the physical training , and is more than happy to share his findings with his students . combat : tell us a little about your reading academy , lucas . lucas : i established the reading academy in 1992 with very few students to begin with , but it has grown in a very big way now . the academy teaches wing chun and kali , my wing chun and kali background has come through the basement , from my teacher nino bernardo . i attended nino 's seminar and noticed a difference between what i was practicing at the seminar that day and what i was practicing at the time with a teacher who referred to himself as a sifu and related himself to a well known master . i begun to question the wing chun i was learning . they may have looked similar but were really poles apart in theory and technique . it was a hard decision to make , asking myself if i wanted to continue with that , or begin again . it was very hard to start again . combat : nino and his " basement " have a great reputation . lucas : nino is a teacher of mine and a very good friend , very good as a guide in my life . nino has a lot to offer and his interpretation of wing chun is a lot deeper , he has taken wing chun to a different level , more than just a system of fighting . he is also a musician , a guitar player , the television advert was just the icing on the cake and it was very well received . combat : you 've been in the limelight yourself , with choreography . lucas : it was by accident . i received a phone call from the sonning mill theatre in reading . they had heard of my background with nino , and that i was the only authentic wing chun school in berkshire . i gave advice on the choreography and the end result was very good . nino came with me to the premiere and the reception we received was excellent . the actor was a very good student and spent time at my school , to copy everything i showed him , and he did extremely well . combat : does kali and wing chun compliment each other ? lucas : yes , although kali is more to do with weapons , and i love kali because of the beautiful coordination , but the way of training is slightly different to wing chun , the weapon is an extension of your hand , it 's bad enough in wing chun ( when you 're learning ) to control your hands but with an extension the job becomes even harder ( laughs ) . so if you can handle this , maybe your wing chun will get better . combat : you believe in wing chun as a concept - can you elaborate on this ? lucas : wing chun is a system that has become a concept . it is a complete system because it combines the totality of the whole body . it shows you a way to adapt to any situation but it does not show you how to do it a particular way . when you complete the system you understand this , when you start you do n't know this . everything starts with a syllabus , when you learn a language you start with the abc . people look at the training , see the chi sau , the counter attack , they do n't see the knock - out , do n't confuse the training with the reality , chi sau prepares you for the fight , when you finish the system , then the concept applies . if you use the concepts of wing chun , basically mean 's how not to get hit , use the strategy of wing chun , the simplicity , then it can be applied to any system you practice or a street - fight because wing chun teaches you not to be stupid . everything in the syllabus is there to help you grow , you have to be honest with the student and explain that what they learn is only the preparation for the fight , it 's the training for the freedom of expression , mental and physical conditioning , the way you train and the way you fight are totally different things . combat : do the concepts go beyond physical practice ? lucas : let 's separate the two issues . physical training is to command your body to do certain things , of course you need the theory and strategy of wing chun to help you to higher levels , but do i have the patience to stay with the system to discover the concept , it 's up to the individual ! when you finish the system do you simply know all the forms , the moves ? is it enough ? do you then just go off boxing and fight ? wing chun can make you a totally different person , a better person . combat : you say that wing chun is not about the mystical , it 's about the logical . lucas : i 'm sure you 've heard a lot of mystical b.s . about secret techniques . if someone has a " secret " technique and he shows it to one person then it 's not a secret anymore is it ? ( smiles ) but we love that secrecy ! we love to think that we know " the secret " . i 've trained with nino over a long period of time and everything he taught me , none of it was secret ( laughs ) . what he taught other students was no secret , as a matter of fact we exchange ideas to a high level , the same way i do with my students . unfortunately some people " sell " the mystical . the accepted history of wing chun makes a nice story but there is no evidence of ng mui or yim wing chun as founders of the system . wing chun was first developed and practised in the siu lim temple in china and there is proof that a wing chun hall existed in the temple itself . once wong shun leung had said it is impossible that just one person created such an efficient combat system . documented history can be traced concretely from leung tsan , to cha wah shun , and then to yip man , followed by wong shun leung who taught my sifu nino bernardo . this is just one lineage under this family tree , but of course , there are many others . combat : do you think that selling the mystical can hide a lack of real knowledge ? lucas : i do n't want to talk about that because i do n't train in anything " mystical " . what i can say is i think kung fu always had mystical connections for the western interpretation and maybe some people have capitalised on that to disguise their own shortcomings . my previous instructor would say to me " you 're not ready " and i was just a student , i had no reason not to believe him . when i was going to nino 's seminar my instructor told me " you 're not ready " , how can you not be ready for a seminar ? ( laughs ) you always have to ask questions , whatever you do , and search for logical explanations , if something you see does n't make sense ask ! do n't feel ashamed or embarrassed . i 'd rather look foolish than waste my money . there should be a logical explanation there . combat : is wing chun still valid as a street self defence system , you 've worked the door ? lucas : as a door supervisor my job was to difuse trouble not add to it , that 's your role . you are being asked to use minimal force , how do you define minimum force ? it 's a whole other area . self defence is a confusing area . what is " real " self defence , let 's dismiss these short courses , they 're a bad idea , you have not matured . you have not developed over time , so your response is not like an " automatic pilot " . you have to condition your mind and body enough to react this way , find the right school and train regularly . combat : you have a motto : " do n't fight angry , fight scared " . what do you mean ? lucas : anger makes you stupid . you lose your focus , you do n't know what you 're doing . being scared will help you , whatever art you practise . i do n't say i know wing chung , let 's fight , i 'm scared you 're going to hurt me and that makes me alert . you need a healthy fear , because fear can cause you to freeze , but a healthy fear can increase your speed and increase your intelligence . combat : wing chun has built its reputation as a street system . lucas : yes , wing chun has been given a bad name in the past , this has come from the street fight . yes , wing chun is a very good form of self defence but is that all ? listen , today we have guns on the street , so if you want to be a street fighter then be aware of that . wing chun has a lot more to offer , it develops mental and physical fitness , coordination , it enhances the ability to learn , helps you cope with stress and fear . it 's amazing how wing chun helps you to deal with you , become aware of yourself before you start dealing with other people . combat : why do n't you like to be called " sifu " ? lucas : in chinese , as i understand it , sifu means teacher , or wise man , so sifu could also be someone who makes shoes , but because it is a term translated into another language , maybe we 're missing the point . i do n't dare call myself sifu , i will leave that to other people . i call nino my sifu because of my respect for him , for what he has given me in our relationship over the years . my students do n't call me sifu but i have a good , friendly relationship with them and there 's mutual respect . i call myself an enthusiastic practitioner of the art of wing chun , which i share and exchange with my students and all of our skills grow as a result . the best way to learn wing chun is to practice , discover , question , and exchange ideas , and the only way to achieve that is through the hard training , having fun , and being patient . ï¿½ copyright 2005 , the reading academy . * portrait photograph of nino bernardo and other assorted imagessite taken by photographer kay lyn all uses of any material from this website must be approved by -

300 - 08872 - 8 . 354pp . ï¿½ 25.00 stewart p. evans and keith skinner , jack the ripper : letters from hell ( stroud : sutton , 2001 ) . isbn 0 - 7509 - 2549 - 3 . 306pp . ï¿½ 20.00 interest in jack the ripper continues to be insatiable . new books , articles and webpages on the subject appear almost weekly ï¿½ a google search on ï¿½ jack the ripper ' yields nearly 197,000 online references with varying degrees of accuracy and seriousness , the front - runner being www.casebook.org . at least three periodicals are entirely devoted to the matter , ripperana , ripper notes , and ripperologist , and it has spawned many films , from hitchcock 's the lodger ( 1926 ) via hands of the ripper ( 1971 ) to the more recent from hell ( 2001 ) . there have been novels and countless television programmes based upon the case , and the description ï¿½ ripper ' is routinely attached to new murder hunts by the tabloid press ( ï¿½ yorkshire ripper ' ; ï¿½ camden ripper ' and many more ) . interest is so great that the national archives finds it necessary to provide a helpful source sheet with a list of the main metropolitan police and home office references relating to the murders . everyone has heard of jack the ripper , even if he tends to blend into the world of sherlock holmes , hansom cabs and thick fog . why does one victorian murderer still exert such world - wide fascination in an age hardly short of its own violent crimes ? the ripper has been outdone many times since 1888 , both in terms of his brutality and the number of his victims . yet the case has taken on a mythic quality , to be reinterpreted again and again by succeeding generations . the basic facts are easily outlined . in the autumn of 1888 five ( maybe six ) london prostitutes were killed and appallingly mutilated in the east end by an unknown murderer who struck suddenly and swiftly by night , and who was never caught . public panic spread far beyond the east end and the police , both city and metropolitan , were widely criticised for their failure to bring the killer to justice . after four months of media frenzy , the attacks stopped . the reason for this is not known , but the theories about it , and the culprit 's identity , are legion . happily neither of the titles reviewed here sets out to unmask the true killer . they are serious attempts to provide solid information and analysis in a field too often oversupplied with sensationalism and titillation . jack the ripper and the london press breaks new ground in its examination of the role of newspaper reporting during the police hunt for the first notorious serial killer . professor curtis has looked in depth at the way the case was covered by fifteen london newspapers , most with national coverage , but three of them local to the east end . the papers are selected , as far as possible , to give a balance of political views . their background and standpoints are described and discussed in detail in chapter six , ï¿½ the first two murders ' ; however it would have been helpful to have a separate list of them as an appendix . the lack of a bibliography and list of sources hinders the reader 's approach somewhat here , though the equivalent information is contained , less accessibly , in the endnotes . professor curtis provides an introduction to the existing ï¿½ ripperature ' , and a useful chapter on ï¿½ images and realities of the east end ' to establish the background to the murder scene . he stresses the prevailing outsiders ' view that the east end was a crime- and disease - ridden , uncivilised ï¿½ jungle ' full of semi - barbarians , so that the ripper case ï¿½ though shocking ï¿½ was perhaps unsurprising . press coverage tapped into this pessimistic vision and exaggerated it for dramatic effect , with rewarding results for newspaper sales figures . it was , of course , the press that enthusiastically adopted the name ï¿½ jack the ripper ' , taking it from the famous ï¿½ dear boss ' letter sent ( almost certainly by a hoaxer ) to the central new agency after the fourth murder . the chapters on the conventions of victorian journalism generally , and on sensational crime - reporting particularly , are an illuminating preparation for professor curtis 's analysis of press reports on the ripper murders as they unfolded , beginning with nichols and chapman and moving on to stride , eddowes and kelly . column inches were extravagantly dedicated to the subject for weeks on end , but the newspapers varied in the amount of graphic detail they were prepared to print , and tended to stress the violent rather than the specifically sexual aspects of the murders . chapter ten , ï¿½ the inquests : reporting the female body ' examines these reports in some detail , much of it gory . all the papers tried to follow up the latest killing with ï¿½ human interest ' angles , recycling evidence from the coroner 's court , often with contradictory results . thus the east london observer quoted a friend of the victim annie chapman telling the court that ï¿½ i have seen her the worse for drink ' , while the western mail rendered the same evidence as ï¿½ farmer asserted that her murdered friend was apparently a sober , steady - going sort of woman ï¿½ who seldom took any drink ' . naturally the papers had their own agendas to promote while covering the story , so the times and the daily telegraph stressed the ï¿½ danger to law and order ' aspect of the case , while the star and the gazette emphasised the need for social reform to alleviate the poverty causing crime . an incidental pleasure of the book is the light it sheds on contemporary journalistic practice . the modern reader is struck by how rapidly an edition could be turned around to include the latest horror . professor curtis describes how the sunday paper , lloyds weekly , received information about the murder of catherine eddowes at 2.10 a.m. , only twenty minutes after her body had been found on 30 september . by 4.00 a.m. the editor was able to start printing an ï¿½ extra special edition ' so that the sensational news could reach the nation 's sabbath breakfast tables : an impressive achievement and a gratifying scoop for his paper . jack the ripper and the london press is strong on factual material and very interesting in its blow - by - blow account of the reporting of this sensational case and of the responses to it from readers who wrote to the papers . it is less persuasive in its analysis of the ï¿½ cultural politics ' of that reporting . what was the cultural impact of the ripper ? no real answer is found here . the final chapter , which attempts to draw a moral from the whole affair , merely seems slightly desperate in its political correctness : ' we must keep asking just how complicitous we ( men ) are with the serial killers whom we have so clearly demonized or ' othered' ï¿½ . in jack the ripper : letters from hell , stewart p. evans and keith skinner have collated and published all the anonymous letters sent to the press , police , home office and others by people claiming to be the ripper , including the ï¿½ dear boss ' letter mentioned earlier . this is a valuable publication for several reasons . the letters are all transcribed and many are reproduced in colour , providing fascinating insights into late victorian handwriting and phraseology , as well as educational levels and the psychopathology of hoaxing . the book contains a good bibliography and list of journals and supplies an index of signatories to the letters , postcards and telegrams . the signatures , predictably , are mainly variations on jack the ripper - ï¿½ jack the riper ' , ï¿½ jack ripper and son ' , ï¿½ jack the skipper ' , ï¿½ jacky the ripper ' , ï¿½ j.t. ripper ' ï¿½ and even overseas claimants such as ï¿½ jack o estripador ' ( of lisbon ) . lesser - known rivals like ï¿½ brumigan bill the slaughterman ' , ï¿½ jim the cutter ' and the ï¿½ black brunswick boy ' also make their appearance , revealing the sheer quantity and variety of correspondence reaching the police at the time , from all over the world . rightly assuming that the background to whitechapel at the time will be well known to those using the book , the authors move straight into an account of the first of the murders , that of emma smith , in april 1888 . each successive killing is clearly outlined and examined against the development of the police investigation and the arrival of increasing quantities of anonymous mail , some sent directly to scotland yard , but much arriving through news agencies or newspapers . publicity given to the ï¿½ dear boss ' letter , written in red ink and signed ï¿½ jack the ripper ' had led to a proliferation of copycat practical jokes and to the permanent assignation of the ripper tag to the crimes known earlier simply as ï¿½ the whitechapel murders ' . many of the letters taunt the police for their lack of progress ; others are clearly fuelled by a personal grudge , like the letter addressed to ï¿½ mr boss , desford industrial school , near liecester [ sic ] ' which read ï¿½ dear boss , i write these few lines to you that the ripper is coming over on the 9 th novr . do n't forget ' . later chapters deal with the involvement of the medium and clairvoyant robert james lees in trying to interpret the letters , and the interest taken by the alienist dr lyttleton forbes winslow , who claimed to have received letters from the ripper . the authors successfully peel back layers of myth that have gathered around ripper writings over the years , revealing the origins of various distortions , pieces of misinformation and even invention in earlier works , like the surprising elevation of the queen 's distinguished physician sir william gull to the role of ripper suspect as a result of pure speculation in an article written in 1970 . who were the hoaxers ? a few were discovered and prosecuted , including a young yorkshire mantle - maker , maria coroner , who had written to her chief constable and to a local newspaper announcing in flowery language the arrival of the ripper in bradford , later claiming she had done it ï¿½ in a joke ' . asking what she had been charged with , she was told it was a breach of the peace under the common law , to which she replied ï¿½ i should like to see the common law , it is so common i have never seen it ' . despite this rash flippancy , she was only bound over to be of good behaviour for six months on her own recognisance of ï¿½ 20 . maria 's landlady claimed that the girl was so excited by reading about the whitechapel murders that she ( the landlady ) was afraid to go to bed at night . miriam howells , an aberdare labourer 's wife , wrote letters as the ripper threatening to kill two local women , but claimed she ï¿½ only did it for a lark ' . she , too , escaped with a similar sentence . edward grover , of fletching in sussex , wrote as the ripper to threaten lord sheffield , who had issued an eviction notice to grover 's mother , but the results of his prosecution are not known . however , the great majority of the hoaxers went undetected . as to their motives , the authors do not attempt to investigate them here , if indeed they can ever be satisfactorily explained . the last section of part one of the book deals with some of the ï¿½ usual suspects ' : druitt , tumblety , cream and others , briefly setting out the case against each and comparing their handwriting with the hoax samples , but coming to no startling new conclusions . part two comprises a very clear , useful calendar of the surviving letters in the national archives and the corporation of london record office . the book is copiously illustrated with contemporary prints , cartoons and photographs as well as the reproductions of the letters themselves . it is an admirable example of the imaginative presentation of original source material , and of considerable interest to cultural and social historians generally , as well as ripper enthusiasts ._. _ _ the final session of the bgs spring meeting 2006 has been organised jointly with years ahead - the north east regional forum on ageing . years ahead was launched in january 2005 and brings together organisations operating at regional level to promote partnership working on issues related to demographic change in the north east , and factors which influence the health and wellbeing of its older population , including social attitudes and perceptions of ageing . with a population of only 2.5 million , the north east is the smallest of the nine english regions . projections suggest that this population will not increase over the next 25 years , and may even decline slightly , while the numbers of those aged 65 and over will increase substantially in keeping with the demographic trend across the uk . this change in the age - structure of the region and the increased numbers of older people will have profound implications at many levels for the people of the north east . years ahead consists of an open network of organisations . it is managed through a partnership board made up of representatives of older people 's groups providing geographic coverage across the north east -- ' from tees to tweed ' , together with an equal number of representatives from regional organisations . thus , there is representation from bodies including age concern , the alzheimer 's society , arts council north east , the association of ne councils , department of work and pensions , equality and diversity forum , government office north east , help the aged , nice north east , the regional development agency and sports england ne , together with older people 's organisations including elders councils , national pensioners convention , ne pensioners association , ne older people 's advisory group , and related groups . this powerful alliance is working to ensure common understanding , at regional level , of the key issues and trends around ageing and demographic change . it provides a platform to review and inform regional strategies , to ensure consistency of approaches to ageing and older people . years ahead will monitor the impact of demographic change and promote partnership working across sectors . much of the work is being done by task groups and the first series of these includes ' implications of demographic change ' ; ' productive ageing / worklessness in the 50 + age group ' ; ' arts and older people ' ; and ' older people and the research agenda ' . the forum will share and promote best practice , and encourage the involvement of older people in , for example , planning and political processes and the research required to inform and implement effective regional strategies . years ahead has its administrative office in the institute for ageing & health at newcastle university and this synergy between academia and the forum is particularly timely given major initiatives by government including the ' northern way ' and the designation of newcastle as a ' science city ' , where ageing and health form an important strand . health was identified by the members of years ahead as the most important single issue for older people and this theme will be taken up at the bgs spring meeting . entitled ' improving the health and welfare of older people : some wider perspectives ' , the symposium has an outstanding list of speakers under the chairmanship of lord sutherland and will span topics from the implications of current basic research on ageing , to issues such as ' work and pensions ' , and ' life - long learning ' . the meeting has already caused tremendous interest amongst older people in the north east , and ' years ahead ' looks forward to welcoming members of the british geriatrics society to the sage centre on saturday 8th april 2006 . jim edwardson wolfson research centre institute for ageing and health , newcastle general hospital_nnp _ _ highlander training courses in june and july -

development proposals you may have noticed that savacentre name has been removed from the bell green site leaving the hypermarket trading simply as sainsbury 's . the inside has also been refurbished with dark blue walls making the hangar look a little more smaller . jeff banks has almost gone and the discreet cctv cameras have been replaced with much larger , more obvious to complement the security guards . looks like they want to make sure we know they do n't trust us ! the old savacentre idea was not a success . indeed sainsbury 's as a whole is fast losing ground to the competition - particulary tesco . on its own these changes are unlikely to make the bell green supermarket successful . however , sainsbury only occupies a part of the former british gas site . there was always an intention to develop the site into a larger retail centre . sainsbury lodged a planning application with lewisham council in 2002 for two large non - food retail units with potential for a smaller a3 unit ( takeaway or restaurant ) totalling nearly 3,000 sq m ( 30,000 sq ft ) . the new development would be situated at the south side of the site ( junction of bell green & southend lane ) . your council approved the proposal in june 2002 despite the fervent opposition of sydenham traders . the original savacentre development had decimated local shops around bell green . the problem became worse when savacentre rationalised the supermarket leading to the closure of most of the small retail units within store ( including the post office ) . this left local residents with fewer local amenities . these problems are not unique to sydenham and in august 2002 the government called the proposal in for further review with consideration as to whether it conformed with government policy on redevelopment on brownfield sites ( the old gas works ) . sainsbury savacentre address & contact details can be found < here > have you got news or views on this ? your feedback your name your email we reserve the right to edit and publish feedback unless it is marked < not for publication>. for your security we will * never * publish full names or email addresses or use an email address for any other reason than responding to your submission without your express permission ._. _ _ you are here : home > news and events > press room press room the pr department 's role is to raise the profile of the parkinson 's disease society ( pds ) , by increasing awareness of the society 's mission and core activities and increasing the understanding of parkinson 's disease . this is undertaken through a range of pr activities including media relations , branch and staff support , advertising , and campaigning . facilities for the media launch our media briefing sheet ( word document 41 kb ) here search our news archive here join our priority news release e -

depth look at just how much determination , passion and sheer hard work was required to get the finished films showing to ecstatic audiences around the world . in short : if you liked the first book you 're going to love this one ! it 's also a much more personal book than the first and , as such , the ultimate fan read - you 'll not only see some amazing pictures ( over 300 of them - nearly all of them new and the vast majority of them exclusive to this publication ) , but you 'll read some amazing accounts of what was required of people to get these movies made . most importantly of all , you 'll feel you 're actually there alongside brian , whether it 's on a very personal tour of the weta effects , weaponry and make - up studios , a helicopter excursion around the film locations used , attendance at the teaser screening at the cannes film festival or exclusive " back stage access " to the film 's premieres in london and wellington . it is a book that is very hard to put down once started and , as such , should carry a warning : do n't try and read this in one sitting , instead indulge yourself over time ! reading from page 1 through page 192 in one go would be akin to walking into your local patisserie and trying to gorge everything on offer over a lunch break . it 's a wonderful keepsake you 'll want to refer back to in years to come . and if you 're one of those fans who thinks they 've read everything there is to read on the movies , whether it 's through reading endless internet web sites , fan club magazine interviews or collecting back issues of the cinefex industry effects magazine you 're in for some pleasant surprises here ! each page brings some new revelation , some account that makes you go " ooh " at the sheer dedication of those involved . that this is so , is partly down to those interviewed of course , but mostly , i think , down to sibley , who wo n't settle for anything less than perfection when it comes to research and writing . i ca n't think of anyone else who would have had me reading two pages about trees and had me as excited at the end of it as if i 'd just done a bungee jump off victoria falls . not that those who prefer a lighter read , or who are a bit less " fanatical " about the minutae of production , need worry - jokey interviews with the likes of dom and billy ( merry and pippin ) , cast comments on the performance of elijah wood , premiere attendance celebrity photo 's and numerous other goodies are amongst the many items to keep you interested right the way through the book . sibley clearly used his time in new zealand to great effect , interviewing literally hundreds of people involved in work on the movie , producing hours of interview footage , and whittling away at all those interviews to produce the volume we have here ( the chapter listing at the end of this review gives an idea as to how comprehensive the areas covered are ) . i started reading this book slightly jealous of his chance to see the movie production at first hand , i finished it thankful that it was him who 'd made the trip and not i , as it became clear just how much hard work he must have gone through to produce the end results we have here - tirelessly interviewing and cherry - picking the best bits to give us our own " edited highlights " of what it must have been like to work on the movie . in the hands of a lesser author such source material would come to naught but a rather dry series of fact and figures . but brian somehow turns that into an account filled with as much passion and excitement as the original film makers clearly had for the project they had embarked upon . time and time again , across its twelve elaborate chapters and associated " feature pull out " sections , the book gives concrete examples of what people have achieved by believing in themselves and their dreams , no matter how great the odds stacked against them seemed to be . it 's a wonderfully positive , life - affirming book and one can not help but be impressed - even those who might have seen the movie but not liked it . this review is in danger of turning into a rather unhealthy hero - worship piece , and " surely " , i can hear you thinking , " it ca n't be that good " . well i 'm afraid to say , it can ! if you forced me to be picky , i 'd admit that the foreward , by sir ian mckellen , is pretty lacklustre , that there are a few typo 's in the book ( personally i blame that proof - reader chappie named in the last paragraph of page 191 ;-) ) and that one or two of the larger photo 's look like they were sourced from second - generation scans . but that really is being picky and is of little real importance here . ultimately this book is a real celebration of a breath - taking achievement . we are lucky indeed to have had peter jackson selected as the director to bring tolkien 's books to the big screen . we are equally lucky to have had brian sibley selected to be the official chronicler of the process of making that happen . i ca n't think of anyone with more integrity , passion and the sheer ability required to write a book such as this , than brian . there is to be a third ( and final ) book in the series , focusing on the writing process and the roles of peter jackson , fran walsh and phillipa boyens . the news that publication of this third book is , at the author 's request , being delayed until september 2004 , to allow the required research work and interviews needed to maintain the quality standards set by this book to be completed , will be a disappointment to some . it is a move that will undoubtedly impact the author and publishing company 's possible royalties as it wo n't have the marketing machine of the third movie to help spur sales , but is entirely typical , in my experience , of the author 's integrity and desire to produce the best work possible , even if that is a financially less secure route . by any standards both the movie franchise as a whole , and this book chronicling how the franchise came to be completed , are incredible achievements . at twice the asking price this hardback volume would be good value , at ï¿½ 17.99 it 's an absolute steal ! essential ! contents : foreward by sir ian mckellen , prologue : the long -

do a little test area first . the physiotherapist used it on my back and i had huge blisters appear within 10 minutes of leaving the physiotherapist 's premises . she said she had not known anyone to have such a severe reaction to the product and made a note in my file not to use it on me again . i had to wait just over 2 weeks before she could do ` hands on ` physiotherapy again because the blisters were still there . lynne 27/10/2005 sarah - any chemists sell it , i believe ... i got mine out of boots .. jan said that she was sensative to biofreeze - but i was amazed that i was n't allergic and even on my face ... i have hundreds of allergies and was amazed that it has n't had a reaction with me ... you can write to the company that make it which is called biofreeze , you can get the address on the net and they will send you out some samples ... sorry i do n't have the address as i was given the samples from the hospital . hope this helps you .. as i 've said previously -

" dr david clark said : " a radical foi act would shift the whole political culture of our country . that is what the white paper aimed at . i had hoped that change would be well underway by now and i regret that the draft bill is not yet available , and the actual legislation not being introduced . we have promised this legislation for so long that we will be judged harshly if we fail live to up to expectations that people rightly have of us . " the campaign for freedom of information 's director , maurice frankel , said : " often secrecy is used to stop the public realising that policies are not working , targets are not being achieved or things are being done that people would find unacceptable . a freedom of information act would help keep government honest . " the campaign said the bill would help to address problems such as : bse : between 1989 and 1991 , professor roy anderson of oxford university repeatedly asked the ministry of agriculture for access to its bse data base . on each occasion it refused . when he was finally able to analyse the figures , in 1996 , they showed that the controls on contaminated cattle feed had not been properly implemented . if known about at the time this finding could have prevented a quarter of a million cattle from being infected , substantially reducing the cost of the epidemic - and the risk to public health . parents were denied information about the high failure rate of hole - in - the - heart operations on babies at the bristol royal infirmary . nine out of 13 babies operated on by one of the surgeons died although nationally , the survival rate was 9 out of 10 . but although the surgeons and the hospital knew that their mortality rate was unacceptably higher than the national figure , parents were given misleading information about the success rates , the true statistics were concealed from the health authority and gps , and the surgeons were allowed to carry on . they have since been struck off the medical register . the scott inquiry showed that ministers had repeatedly given parliament misleading information about government policy on supplying arms to iraq , after secretly revising arms sales guidelines . this approach was justified by the former foreign secretary , lord howe , on the grounds that the government " is not necessarily to be criticised for a difference between policy and presentation of policy " and by a senior civil servant who commented that " half a picture can be accurate " . scott reported that the government feared that public pressure might force it to drop its policy of arming saddam hussein and secrecy was used to prevent such pressure . mr mackinlay 's freedom of information bill would create a right of access to information held by all government departments and all public authorities at central and local level . information could be withheld only if disclosure would cause " substantial harm " to interests such as defence , international relations , law enforcement and commercial confidentiality . even exempt information could be disclosed in the public interest , for example , if there had been serious wrongdoing . the bill would be enforced by a new information commissioner with the power to order government to disclose . the bill is being introduced under the 10-minute rule procedure , which allows a measure to be debated - but does not lead to actual legislation . its co - sponsors are : chris mullin mp ( lab ) , chair of the home affairs select committee ;

handler.handleelement ( ) ; on the other hand if there are few branches , then , with a decent jvm , the difference between string.equals and = = is going to be insignificant . in any case , with a small addition to the xmlreader interface it 'd be possible for internal parser tables to support most of the core cases of this programming style ( even if it 's poor style ) . if we added the following method to xmlreader , string intern(string tobeinterned ) then a contenthandler implementor could write code like this , xmlreader r = xmlreaderfactory.createreader ( ) ; // pre - populate the readers intern table and get refs // to the ( per - parser ) uniqued strings string elem1 = r.intern("elem1 " ) string elem2 = r.intern("elem2 " ) // ... string elemn = r.intern("elemn " ) ; r.parsedocument ( ... ) ; r.parsedocument ( ... ) ; // etc . // then in the contenthandler implementation if(foo = = elem1 ) // handle elem1 else if(foo = = elem2 ) // handle elem2 // repeat many times else if(foo = = elemn ) // handle elemn i think that something like this will get most people most of what they want . to be honest , tho ' , i do n't see any particular reason why the sax api should be expected to support this sort of code . > > but i 'd much prefer it if the sax api did n't expose any > > interning behaviour at all . i think we agree on that ? > > i think we 're * arguing * about that ... i do n't detect > agreement yet . -t. err ... sorry , misunderstanding . my question was directed at david b ( who i think does agree with me on that ) . -- miles sabin cromwell media internet systems architect 5/6 glenthorne mews + 44 ( 0)20 8817 4030 london , w6 0lj , england msabin at cromwellmedia.com http://www.cromwellmedia.com/ xml - dev : a list for w3c xml developers . to post , mailto : xml - dev at ic.ac.uk archived as : http://www.lists.ic.ac.uk/hypermail/xml-dev/ or cd - rom / isbn 981 - 02 - 3594 - 1 please note : new list subscriptions now closed in preparation for transfer to oasis . previous message : great controversies of xml next message : string interning ( was : sax2/java : towards a final form ) messages sorted by : [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ] more information about the xml - dev mailing list_nn _ _ new , links to over 1000 uk clinical guidelines - see here for more information use the search box above to find things quickly , or browse sections ... health and disease leaflets ( some have translations ) listen to content of leaflets - download , stream or podcast patient support organisations , self - help groups , etc all about medicines healthy lifestyle and preventing illness tests and investigations directory of websites on disease , news , equipment , nhs , etc reference articles used by uk health professionals more detail - guidelines , ebm , textbooks , images , medline health books - book of the month ' defeat depression ' patients ' experience of diseases - why not contribute ? poems and stories about health - why not contribute ? find a doctor , hospital , dentist , therapist , etc health / medical insurance quotes choices when you are referred to a specialist what s new ? click here to book appointments with your gp and order your repeat prescriptions online are you interested in writing health - related poems or stories for patient uk ? read about this would you like to be involved in decisions that effect the provision of healthcare locally ? find out more_rbr _ _ at an historic gathering , research lodges and associations under the english constitution met under the umbrella of the united grand lodge of england ( ugle ) and quatuor coronati lodge no . 2076 , the premier lodge of masonic research . the meeting was jointly chaired by former grand secretary jim daniel , master of quatuor coronati lodge , and john hamill , ugle director of communications . professor andrew prescott of the centre for research into freemasonry at the university of sheffield , and diane clements , director of the library & museum of freemasonry , presented updates and future plans . jim daniel , referring to the research papers published in the transactions of quatuor coronati lodge , commented : " it is difficult to find papers for publication . there are fewer members of the craft interested in genuine original research or are willing ï¿½ or able ï¿½ to undertake it . we are concerned that our transactions are not recognised in the academic world , and we want to explore ways of raising the standard ï¿½ actual and perceived ï¿½ of our transactions . " we therefore thought it would be useful to get a snapshot of the research situation , warts and all , and then to consider whether and how things should and can be improved . " both jim daniel and john hamill underlined the importance of masonic research not just as an academic or quasi - academic activity , but to educate members of the craft , and provide factual information about freemasonry to the wider public . jim daniel said : " we know that other research lodges and associations exist within the english constitution , but suspect that the current state of communication among them ï¿½ and with such resources as the library & museum of freemasonry and the centre for research into freemasonry ï¿½ may not be working to everyone 's advantage . " he urged more people to undertake research , producing valuable results which could be published . more than 30 research lodges and associations were at the meeting , including representatives from jamaica and south africa , with bob cooper , curator of the grand lodge of scotland museum and library also in attendance . john hamill said : " grand lodge sees masonic research as an important aspect of the ongoing policy on better informing the outside world about freemasonry . " it is also seen as an important part of masonic education , particularly as new members are keen to know what they have joined , how it has evolved and how it fits into society in general . working with academics is a key part of the policy of restoring the public reputation of freemasonry . " he added that the support of grand lodge was not only in words but in hard cash . together with the province of yorkshire west riding and the pro grand master , lord northampton , grand lodge had provided the first three years funding for the centre for masonic research at sheffield and grand lodge and supreme grand chapter would continue to provide the main funding for sheffield until at least 2009 . john hamill said : " grand lodge has introduced mq magazine as a means of direct communication with all members . each issue contains the results of research , news on masonic education as well as from the library and museum and the other research organisations . " he added that his last major project as librarian and curator at grand lodge had been to establish charitable status for the library and museum , enabling it to be properly funded in a tax - efficient way to enable it to attract monies from other sources . he paid tribute to his successor , diane clements , and her staff for the significant amount of work they had undertaken in the last five years to make more of the collections more readily available to researchers . diane had also succeeded in gaining two major national lottery heritage grants to enable two major tranches of archive material to be properly catalogued and conserved . he went on : " masonic research has a great champion in the pro grand master , lord northampton . he has founded and funded the canonbury research centre , with its concentration on the more esoteric aspects of freemasonry and its relationship to other initiatic rites . he has given great support to the cornerstone society , sheffield and to freemasonry today . " representatives of research lodges and associations presented briefs on their work , which was varied , but showed considerable activity . diane clements pointed out that objects were also important for research as well as text , including masonic music . the library & museum collection was now more accessible via the internet , and there was a digital version of the membership records and grand lodge proceedings 1813 - 2001 . the library & museum had received funding for 450 documents on the history of the two freemasons ' halls and it was planned to extend lane 's masonic records 1717 - 1894 into the 20th century , adding those of the royal arch ._. _ _ tim crook - is your source ever really safe ? 7 david cox - public and be damned 13 richard lindley - pick your fights carefully 20 jean seaton - rows and consequences 26 brian jenner - diary daze 33 sandra nyaira - chill wind in zimbabwe 39 geoffrey goodman - hugo young : an appreciation 45 patrick collins - united we fall 49 louisa young - journalism by the book 55 book reviews matthew engel on roy greenslade 61 anthony delano on chris horrie 63 mark hollingsworth on bill hagerty 66 gerald kaufman on geoffrey goodman 69 ivor gaber on stuart allan 72 michael leapman on bruce page 75 charles perkins on sidney blumenthal 77 editorial - saving the bbc 's credibility among journalists who work for rival news media , the bbc has never had a great number of friends . one reason may be the attitude of some of its reporters and producers in the field , those who have earned the corporation a reputation for arrogance by assuming they have a right to precedence and exclusivity , a right which officials and other sources of information have often been eager to concede ...

generally estimated at 10 - 20 % more productive 90 % were satisfied with teleworking 22 % said they had worked when otherwise they would have felt too ill to travel in for a whole days work bt say they have made ï¿½ 100 million per year space savings : teleworking staff are expected to give up having a permanent desk , and use touch - down areas when at the office . travel reduction is also significant , with a reduction of car commuting of an average 178 miles per week per teleworker , 220 miles per week for rail commuters . another interesting feature of the case study concerns time budgets : 69 % said their working time had increased 87 % said that they had more time for their family 6 % said they had more time for community activities these response indicate that although people say they are putting in more hours , being based at home and avoiding the commute also allows them to have a more fulfilling social life . teleworking at baa teleworking at british airports authority , heathrow , is being driven by the need to optimise space and reduce car commuting . teleworking is promoted through the alternative work styles programme . 64 of the 250 staff at west point , heathrow , now telework . the level of teleworking varies from 1 - 2 days per week to 1 day per month . there are different levels of uptake between departments . travel savings have been calculated on the basis of just 2 teleworking days per month . with an average round trip of 64.3 km , that leads to a saving of 128 km per month . this is comparable with the results being achieved from baa 's very successful car - sharing programme . it is pointed out that teleworking is only in its infancy here , and has not been promoted in the same way as the other options in the company travel plan . teleworking is also contributing to space saving . based on a survey of the under - occupancy of desks , west point has been able to consolidate space and lease out one building leading to a ï¿½ 400k per annum saving . teleworking is only one factor here , but a conservative estimate is that it is responsible for ï¿½ 36k per annum of this saving . what 's next full details of these case studies can be found on the sustel website . also there are another 8 case studies from the uk and denmark . still to come in the project are further monitoring of the case study sites , as well as the case studies from the other 3 countries . we look forward also to seeing the tools and business guidance that are to be developed this year . if , of course , you ca n't wait for these , take a look around flexibility - you 'll find plenty of guidance and some useful tools ! f urther info the sustel project is funded by the european commission 's ist initiative . it is led by the uk centre for environment and economic development ( ukceed ) and has partners from denmark , italy , germany and the netherlands . further details of the project , plus the case studies so far published , can be found on the sustel website at :_: _ _ the diary of martha ballard at the heart of this sophisticated site is the diary ( of over 1400 pages ) kept by martha ballard , a late -

tree in bloom , the young major could see , three hundred feet below him , the town of menda , at the base of the rock on which the castle is built . turning his head , he looked down upon the sea , the sparkling waters of which encircled the landscape with a sheet of silver . the chateau was illuminated . the joyous uproar of a ball , the sounds of an orchestra , the laughter of the dancers came to him , mingling with the distant murmur of the waves . the coolness of the night gave fresh energy to his body , that was tired with the heat of the day . besides which , the gardens were planted with trees so balmy and flowers so sweet , that the young man felt as if plunged in a perfumed bath . the chateau de menda belonged to a grandee of spain , who was at this time living there with his family . during the whole evening , the eldest daughter had looked at the young officer with an interest expressing extreme sadness , and such implied compassion on the part of a spaniard might well have caused the reverie of the frenchman . clara was beautiful ; and though she had three brothers and one sister , the wealth of the marquis de leganes seemed sufficient to justify victor marchand in believing that the young lady would be richly dowered . but could he dare to believe that the daughter of the proudest noble in spain would be given to the son of a parisian grocer ? besides , frenchmen were hated . the marquis having been suspected by general g -- t -- r , who governed the province , of preparing an insurrection in favor of ferdinand vii . , the battalion commanded by victor marchand was quartered in the little town of menda , to hold in check the neighboring districts , which were under the control of the marquis de leganes . a recent despatch from marechal ney made it seem probable that the english would soon land a force upon the coast ; and he mentioned the marquis as the man who was believed to be in communication with the cabinet of london . thus , in spite of the cordial welcome which that spaniard had given to victor marchand and his soldiers , the young officer held himself perpetually on his guard . as he came from the ballroom to the terrace , intending to cast his eye upon the state of the town and the outlying districts confided to his care , he asked himself how he ought to interpret the good will which the marquis never failed to show him , and whether the fears of his general were warranted by the apparent tranquillity of the region . but no sooner had he reached the terrace than these thoughts were driven from his mind by a sense of prudence , and also by natural curiosity . he saw in the town a great number of lights . although it was the feast of saint james , he had , that very morning , ordered that all lights should be put out at the hour prescribed in the army regulations , those of the chateau alone excepted . he saw , it is true , the bayonets of his soldiers gleaming here and there at their appointed posts ; but the silence was solemn , and nothing indicated that the spaniards were disregarding his orders in the intoxication of a fete . endeavoring to explain to himself this culpable and deliberate infraction of rules on the part of the inhabitants , it struck him as the more incomprehensible because he had left a number of officers in charge of patrols who were to make their rounds during the night , and enforce the regulations . with the impetuosity of youth , he was about to spring through an opening in the terrace wall , and descend by the rocks more rapidly than by the usual road to a little outpost which he had placed at the entrance of the town , on the side toward the chateau , when a slight noise arrested him . he fancied he heard the light step of a woman on the gravelled path behind him . he turned his head and saw no one , but his eyes were caught by an extraordinary light upon the ocean . suddenly he beheld a sight so alarming that he stood for a moment motionless with surprise , fancying that his senses were mistaken . the white rays of the moonlight enabled him to distinguish sails at some distance . he tried to convince himself that this vision was an optical delusion caused by the caprices of the waves and the moon . at that moment , a hoarse voice uttered his name . he looked toward the opening in the wall , and saw the head of the orderly who had accompanied him to the chateau rising cautiously through it ._. _ _ ignore my rhetoric , i 'm only here for the sex matt ridley this article originally appeared in the daily telegraph , 26 november 1996 according to conventional wisdom , there are two reasons why people hold the political views they do : either they have been convinced by the evidence , or they are expressing self - interest . but there is a third possibility , one that applies especially to people in their early twenties , when they are at their most ideological : that they are showing off to the opposite sex . later this week the think - tank demos publishes its latest quarterly journal , a special issue devoted to what evolutionary theory has to tell us about the economic and social behaviour of human beings . it contains an unsettling article by geoffrey miller of university college london in which he argues that some political ideology , and indeed most art and culture , exist only because of sexual exhibitionism inherited from our ancestors . dr miller recalls his days at student demonstrations in new york against apartheid ( he 's a child of the tame 1980s , but we wo n't hold that against him ) . ' i was puzzled by the spontaneity , ardour and near - unanimity of the student demands , ' he says , adding : ' everyone i knew was dating someone they 'd met at the sit - in . in many cases , the ideological commitment was paper - thin , and the protest ended just in time to study for semester exams . yet the sexual relationships facilitated by the protest somtimes lasted for years . ' he goes on to describe an idea he first argued elsewhere , that the brain grew so big so rapidly ( during the past two million years ) not chiefly because it was useful in a practical sense , but because our ancestors began picking their mates on the basis of their mental creativity . the brain was , and is , an organ designed primarily for courtship and seduction , like the peacock 's tale or the nightingale 's song . many of its other capabilities are fortunate side - effects . this is part of a respectable and well - supported theory called sexual selection , which argues that members of one sex can breed new features into member of the opposite sex in just the same way that pigeon fanciers breed new features into their pigeons : by persistent selection , generation after generation . charles darwin thought this might explain peacocks ' tails ( it does ) and might have been even more important than natural selection in species such as human beings . we are all descended from people who had babies . even though millions of human beings have died childless or celibate , none of them was ever the ancestor of anybody alive today . so the one thing that distinguished our ancestors from their contemporaries was that they were better at winning mates and rearing families . that meant being good at survival , but it also meant being good at persuasion . using the newly invented telepathy called language , our ancestors began to test whether potential mates were creative enough by looking inside their brains . an arms race between the sexes ensued , one becoming more discriminatory , the other more creative ( or probably both becoming both at the same time ) . dr miller reckons it is no coincidence that the upsurge of political ideology in our early twenties coincides with the main period of human courtship . by taking up a political cause you can show off your ideology ( caring , empathetic , concerned ) , your virtuosity ( energetic , inspiring ) and your ambition ( crafty , hungry ) : whichever , it 's a good way to draw the attention of the opposite sex . he argues that the fact that politics seems to matter more to young men than it does to young women also fits the theory , since men are generally the sexual sellers in a buyer 's market . the rights and wrongs of the issues in question hardly matter ; indeed , what counts is to keep shifting the focus from one issue to another to show originality : from vietnam to the environment ; apartheid to veal calves . it is a disturbing thought that ( to quote dr miller ) : ' people respond to policy ideas first as big - brained , idea - infested , hypersexual primates , and only secondly as concerned citizens in a modern polity . ' but it will not , he adds , surprise political pollsters , spin doctors and speech writers , who have long been accustomed to the notion that people care more for how politicians ' look ' and ' feel ' than for what they say . ronald reagan was , of course , the master of the non - verbal cue and was personally more popular than his policies . margaret thatcher , whose non - verbal cues were less effective , had to rely on winning the argument instead , and always lagged behind her policies in popularity . roger masters of dartmouth college showed americans brief television clips of unknown politicians from france , germany and america and asked them how they felt about them . with the sound turned down , the americans disliked the two foreigners intensely . with the sound turned up , they realised they were foreign and liked them much more . the unfamiliar body language of the foreigners had been subliminally unattractive . this is intriguing because it contradicts the common assumption that xenophobia stems from cultural differences , not psycchological effects . dr miller also did some experiments , revealing that students believe political views are indeed proxies for personality among their peers . they think conservatives are ambitious and self - motivated ( which many women like in men ) ; and they think liberals are empathetic and caring ( which many men like in women ) . hence the gap between the sexes in political views , more male students than female being conservative . will john major 's teeth or tony blair 's hair win the election ?_. _ _ engineering a functional formulation . transcript of a seminar given by richard taylor in cambridge , thursday 20th november 2003 . yesterday evening i attended a lecture given by sidney brenner , the 2002 winner of the nobel prize in medicine . i thought i 'd start today 's session by sharing with you an idea that he asked his audience to consider . this is the premise that the only science worth doing is what introduced as " cap " science - science that is complete , accurate and permanent . as an illustration he used genome projects as an example of a scientific endeavour which can be completed , they have a well defined end , it is possible to know when a genome has been completely sequenced , or at least how much has been done . sequencing a genome is also something that can be done accurately , and to a measurable accurate and repeatable standard . the results of a genome sequencing project are also permanent , they will be of value to future generations of researchers who will build on the foundations of the complete genome sequences . brenner was one of the proponents of sequencing the human genome , promoting the idea against people who believed it would be better to wait for improved faster and more economic sequencing technologies . there are other examples of cap science throughout brenner 's career , including most famously investigating the development of c. elegans , where the fate of every cell and the pathway from the original cell to the final organism is defined and fixed and once determined is a body of knowledge that will always remain true . how do our investigations into pharmaceutical formulations match up to the high standard of cap science ? in essence pretty badly . there are an infinite number of potential excipients , an infinite number of sugars , lipids , proteins , buffers , and salts that we could use in any combination to attempt to give a pharmaceutical entity the desired properties . as well as the range of possible excipients , the set of forms in which we may desire the final product is also limitless ; from liquid , through lyophilised , dry particles , aerosolised , as a cream . in terms of accuracy , there is one area of our work in particular in which accuracy is very difficult to achieve ï¿½ determining viral titres . viruses are one of the pharmaceutical entities which we work on formulating . we attempt to measure any loss of activity of the virus both during the formulation process and afterwards during storage . while the assays we can do can be tuned so that the results are repeatable and precise , the actual numbers that are obtained from them are essentially meaningless . a viral titre , is attempting to represent the number of infectious particles in a certain amount of solid or liquid . however the number obtained depends on many variables , including the components of the excipient , how the excipient or the process affects the clumping together of the virus , as well as the cells used for the assay and the assay format . the resultant numbers are certainly not absolute values such as the number of subunits in a protein complex . as for permanence , there are two things that prevent much work that has been done previously on formulation being of relevance today and will prevent anything we achieve from being of importance into the future . regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical formulations are now very much tighter than even twenty or thirty years ago . all the components of a pharmaceutical product must be completely characterised , and the product must be demonstratably consistent from batch to batch . this point is illustrated by the image of a calf , with cow - pox shown on this slide , what is happening here is the collection of " vaccine lymph " from the confluent cow pox pustules on the calf with a serrated fork scraper . the product is formulated into usable smallpox vaccine by freeze drying and the sole addition of 0.5 % phenol as an antibacterial agent . the mixture of components of calf skin scrapings , including gelatine results in a formulation that enables the vaccina virus to survive freeze drying and subsequent storage both in freezers and in unrefrigerated conditions . achieving a formulation that enables an enveloped virus to survive as well as this today using completely characterised components is challenging . as well as regulation , advances in technologies that are constantly requiring new formulations is the other factor ensuring the lack of permanence for the results of formulation research . examples include transdermal and inhalable powders in terms of the final product , and new drying and water extraction technologies in terms of processing methods . if we accept that what we are doing here is not good science , then what are we doing ? we are working on industrially and socially relevant topics . we work with a number of companies with novel products which require formulation , including xenova ( large enveloped viruses ) , phico therapeutics ( therapeutic bacteriophage ) , and cobra biomanufacturing ( manufacturer of adenoviral and plasmid gene therapy vectors ) . as well as the novel products , we also work with novel processing technologies , supercritical carbondioxide based controlled particle size production from necktar therapeuctis , an freeze dryer with improved consistency in freezing from asymptote in cambridge and a variety of spray drying technologies we have available in our labs . one of the spraying techniques involves using an inkjet printer derived pizo - electric droplet generator which can be used to create a fine mist for rapid freezing and drying . the use of the inkjet also opens up the opportunity to attempt drying virus particles in the presence of stabilising excipients onto various papers , filters and membranes . applications of this technology could include the production of positive controls for analytical detection technologies and potentially ordered phage display arrays . one of the roles of bioscience engineering in the environment of massively parallel big biology experiments is to develop technologies and equipment , this is an example of such an area . our other role is one of a consumer of the information that is produced by such projects , and to use it to inform developments . there are a number of areas of current interest in which formulation is crucially important . one such area is biological warfare and biological terrorism agents . russia has attempted to devise methods of getting smallpox , a delicate enveloped virus from russia to another county in an intercontinental ballistic missile . the virus which only survives at room temperature for about six hours and is extremely sensitive to heat and sunlight needs to be treated extremely carefully if it is to survive a trip in a rocket . the solution to this problem involved refridgerating the loaded warhead in the missile silo , cooling the payload during flight , using extra fins which get hot and wick the heat away from the delicate cargo , landing the warheads softly via parachute , and finally achieving aerosol dispersion by releasing pressurised carbondioxide . in terms of resilience to conditions in a missile , anthrax spores are practically indestructible when compared to an enveloped virus . iraq is thought to have prepared anthrax spores to survive a trip in a scud missile by using a fine powdered clay based formulation . while no technologically difficult refrigeration required on the behalf of the iraqis , the formulation does present another problem . if such scuds are to be destroyed by patriot anti missile missiles and the biological agent is not to be released in an active form the heat produced in the destruction has to be sufficiently intense to destroy protected anthrax spores , achieving this is a consideration in the specification of such missiles . the importance of formulation in biological weapons production can be seen in the initial response to the 2001 anthrax attacks in washington . an initial test , suggesting anthrax was present was conducted at the locations where the letters were opened , but one of the first indication that there was really serious problem was when the formulation of the powder was investigated . when the powder was opened in a bio - safety cabinet it was observed to fly around in the air currents in the cabinet , and was described as " energetic " , clearly specially prepared in an aerosoliseable form . when looked at by the electron microscope an appearance indicative of the presence of a nano - glass excipeint being present was observed to prevent clumping and encourage crumbling of particles . had the anthrax been a smear of bacterial gunk on dried onto the paper of the letter , it is unlikely it would have had such an effect , in this case the formulation was key . gene therapy is another area where formulation of viruses is important , it is also an emerging and fast growing area where non traditional drug delivery routes such as inhaleable dry powders may be particularly suited . some of the major barriers to gene therapy are targeting the vector to the desired tissue and preventing a deleterious immune response against the vector . formulation has the potential to assist in overcoming both hurdles . vaccines are still an area of application for virotherapeutics , as are novel virus based drugs such as phico therapeutic 's anti - bacterial bacteriophage , a bacterial virus carrying a gene for a protein which binds to and inactivates all bacterial dna killing the bactera . in addition to our work on viruses we also use plasmids and liposomes , both as model systems and as biological entities which may be used as therapeutics and require formulation in their own right . we are also able to use liposomes as a method for achieving protective viral formulation . we were given a clue to the potential of using lipids as an excipient when we observed that crude unpurified virus survived much better through processing than purified samples , the main difference between two being the presence of cell debris , mainly membranes with the unpurified virus . in an attempt to add back the missing components , we also tried encapsulating the virus in liposomes , which was a successful strategy . with the plasmid dna , an exciting approach involves complexing the dna with some positively charged synthetic peptide like polymers generated in the cambridge unit for bio - responsive polymers , this results in the stringy plasmids collapsing into tight balls , this effect can be seen in the electron microscope image on the slide . the complexes have a greater ability to withstand the stresses and sheer forces involved in the production of small particles . a formulation of such particles could be used if delivered transdermally as a dna vaccine , or inhaled as a gene therapy vector . finally i am going to introduce the concept that encompasses a lot of what we do : " functional formulation " , adding properties to the pharmaceutical product at the formulation stage . such properties may include targeting the therapeutic to particular cells , modulating the immune response , slow or controlled release , as well as items such as particle size and shelf life . an example within this department is the glucose sensitive membrane disrupting polymers being developed by matt hall . adding such controls at the formulation stage , rather than through genetic engineering of a virus , or engineering a protein , provides a simpler cheaper and regulatory simpler approach . another reason this is an interesting area is that it is possible to re - patent existing drugs in novel formulations , and if the new formulations can be shown to provide significant benefits then there is the potential to make serious money , avoiding the most costly stages of drug development , finding the active molecule and proving efficacy . it is with the aim of adding functional targeting , and metabolite sensing and immunomodulation molecules to formulations that we are currently working with liposomes , and membranes coated with bacterial surface layers which can be used as a scaffold for active moieties . this introduction was followed by a powerpoint presentation showing experimental methods and results , and mathematical models of phenomena ._. _ _ the guardian reports that canker well , the spring feeding ilkley , yorkshire , once of great repute medicinally , has re -

" wells , healing and holy , are here for the use of . not simply for ' the glory of god ' nor as an outstanding example of antiquity ' . this is not to say that folklorists should n't investigate wells or their legends , and christians should n't recognise the hand of god in the holiness of them . it is just that they should realise the origins and functions of these places . wells were worshipped for their healing properties and for their abundance during times of drought . wells were attended and cared for , the spirit of the well being recognised as another aspect of the earth mother , the great goddess . wells are here , now and alive today , some are neglected . some hidden away , all are alive and just waiting to be renewed with energy . get in touch with the spirit of the waters and the surrounding area , use the waters ' healing power and , in taking from the well , give back something - an offering of flowers , energy or love . to be touched by the presence of bride/ brigid is a beautiful experience and it is open to anyone who is open to it . all this does n't apply just to wells , but to all holy places , be they mounds , standing stones , mazes , trees , any ancient place of worship that have throughout time been usurped by the newer religion of christianity or encased in victorian - style spiritless collections of antiques and curios . the editorial in orthodox news spoke of " a duty to see that water is used to promote christianity rather than folklorist superstition " and cautioned against " the rebirth of indigenous forms of superstition and occult beliefs " . superstition in my experience is usually based on half - forgotten facts and it seems that christians always assume that belief in older religions has died out . this is not so . and most occult practice has very little to do with holy wells . i 've been to christian " well - dressing " ceremonies where no - one knew the actual location of the well they were supposed to be venerating , if one existed . at whitwell they have a well - dressing at a stand - pump and at rowsley they dress a horse - trough ! but when all is said and done , please remember that all gods are but one god , and all goddesses but the one true goddess .

vim [ options ] -t tag vim [ options ] -q [ errorfile ] ex view gvim gview rvim rview rgvim rgview description vim is a text editor that is upwards compatible to vi . it can be used to edit all kinds of plain text . it is especially useful for editing programs . there are a lot of enhancements above vi : multi level undo , multi win- dows and buffers , syntax highlighting , command line editing , filename completion , on - line help , visual selection , etc .. see " : help vi " for a summary of the differences between vim and vi . while running vim a lot of help can be obtained from the on - line help system , with the " : help " command . see the on - line help section below . most often vim is started to edit a single file with the command vim file more generally vim is started with : vim [ options ] [ filelist ] if the filelist is missing , the editor will start with an empty buffer . otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to choose one or more files to be edited . file .. a list of filenames . the first one will be the current file and read into the buffer . the cursor will be posi- tioned on the first line of the buffer . you can get to the other files with the " : next " command . to edit a file that starts with a dash , precede the filelist with " -- " . - the file to edit is read from stdin . commands are read from stderr , which should be a tty . -t { tag } the file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a " tag " , a sort of goto label . { tag } is looked up in the tags file , the associated file becomes the current file and the associated command is executed . mostly this is used for c programs , in which case { tag } could be a function name . the effect is that the file containing that function becomes the current file and the cursor is positioned on the start of the function . see " : help tag - commands " . -q [ errorfile ] start in quickfix mode . the file [ errorfile ] is read and the first error is displayed . if [ errorfile ] is omitted , the filename is obtained from the ' errorfile ' option ( defaults to " aztecc.err " for the amiga , " errors.vim " on other systems ) . further errors can be jumped to with the " : cn " command . see " : help quickfix " . vim behaves differently , depending on the name of the command ( the exe- cutable may still be the same file ) . vim the " normal " way , everything is default . ex start in ex mode . go to normal mode with the " : vi " command . can also be done with the " -e " argument . view start in read - only mode . you will be protected from writing the files . can also be done with the " -r " argument . gvim gview the gui version . starts a new window . can also be done with the " -g " argument . rvim rview rgvim rgview like the above , but with restrictions . it will not be possi- ble to start shell commands , or suspend vim . can also be done with the " -z " argument . options the options may be given in any order , before or after filenames . options without an argument can be combined after a single dash . + [ num ] for the first file the cursor will be positioned on line " num " . if " num " is missing , the cursor will be positioned on the last line . + /{pat } for the first file the cursor will be positioned on the first occurrence of { pat}. see " : help search - pattern " for the available search patterns . + { command } -c { command } { command } will be executed after the first file has been read . { command } is interpreted as an ex command . if the { command } contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes ( this depends on the shell that is used ) . example : vim " + set si " main.c note : you can use up to 10 " + " or " -c " commands . --cmd { command } like using " -c " , but the command is executed just before processing any vimrc file . you can use up to 10 of these commands , independently from " -c " commands . -b binary mode . a few options will be set that makes it pos- sible to edit a binary or executable file . -c compatible . set the ' compatible ' option . this will make vim behave mostly like vi , even though a .vimrc file exists . -d start in diff mode . there should be two or three file name arguments . vim will open all the files and show differ- ences between them . works like vimdiff(1 ) . -d { device } open { device } for use as a terminal . only on the amiga . example : " -d con:20/30/600/150 " . -e start vim in ex mode , just like the executable was called " ex " . -f foreground . for the gui version , vim will not fork and detach from the shell it was started in . on the amiga , vim is not restarted to open a new window . this option should be used when vim is executed by a program that will wait for the edit session to finish ( e.g. mail ) . on the amiga the " : sh " and " : !

' libraries have long since established what standards will be followed and who is responsible for new input , database maintenance , technical upkeep and development decisions with respect to their online catalogs , but they are starting from scratch with their web lists ' p63 the book gives scant information on the problems associated with managing the licences to online resources , providing only one short paragraph ( p15 ) . it does not address the sustainability of business models associated with aggregator databases , or the likely loss of material to a library if licences are discontinued . the final chapter gives some indications of trends to watch . this seems both limited and dated with open access institutional repositories - now well established services for many libraries - and functional requirements for bibliograhic records ( frbr ) the only issues addressed . there is no mention of a large number of problems of organisation and cataloguing currently being addressed by the library community - learning objects , e - learning resources , digital curation and preservation , open source delivery solutions , the use of xml and the possibilities afforded by the resources description framework ( rdf ) - to name a few . conclusion if a library needs a simple model , as a starting point , to help organise and catalogue licensed online resources into the established library catalogue using established workflows , then this book is ideal . however , it would seem to have been published too late for many institutions , which will have already solved the problems it addresses , and are now seeking to deal with a wider variety of digital resources through creative solutions . institutions in such a position will find this book both frustrating and disappointing . author details sarah higgins metadata coordinator edinburgh university library email : sarah.higgins@ed.ac.uk web site : http://www.lib.ed.ac.uk return to top article title : " cataloguing and organizing digital resources : a how - to - do - it manual for librarians " author : sarah higgins publication date : 30-october-2005 publication : ariadne issue 45 originating url : http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue45/higgins-rvw/intro.html copyright and citation information file last modified : saturday , 29-oct-2005 20:23:36 bst ariadne is published every three months by ukoln . ukoln is funded by mla the museums , libraries and archives council , the joint information systems committee ( jisc ) of the higher education funding councils , as well as by project funding from the jisc and the european union . ukoln also receives support from the university of bath where it is based . material referred to on this page is copyright ariadne ( university of bath ) and original authors_nns _ _ the sanger institute website provides a site search service . if you can not find the page you are looking for please try a site search below . it would help us if you would inform us when you find a " 404 error : file not found " by completing the lower form so that we can correct the problem . if the " referring url " box is not automatically filled in , please insert the url that brought you here ( found in the location / address window of your browser ) . also please submit your name and email address so that we can email you the correct / updated url you are seeking . finally please remember that urls are case sensitive . ensure you have typed in the url exactly as written .

year project led by professor baz kershaw and the department of drama : theatre , film , television at the university of bristol . it is funded by the arts and humanities research board . parip 's objectives are to investigate creative - academic issues raised by practice as research , where performance is understood as performance media : theatre , dance , film , video and television . as a result of parip 's investigations and in collaboration with colleagues , educational institutions and professional bodies throughout the uk and europe parip aims to develop national frameworks for the encouragement of the highest standards in representing practical -

based research ( pbr ) ï¿½ and ' research through practice ' , ' research by practice ' , ' performance as research ' ï¿½ are contested terms that resist close definition . practice as research and practice - based research are frequently used interchangeably to suggest a relationship of research between theory and practice . broadly speaking , practice as research is an attempt to see and understand performance media practices and processes as arenas in which knowledges might be opened . the institutional acceptance of practice as research in the higher education sector acknowledges fundamental epistemological issues that can only be addressed in and through theatre , dance , film , tv and video practices . click here for more information what is documentation ? documentation is a term that requires unpacking . baz kershaw has sought to differentiate documentation in terms of ' integral ' and ' external ' documentation . integral documentation is taken to be the mass of heterogeneous trace materials that the practice process creates . these materials may be of similar kind / order in both live and mediatized performance practices : eg script drafts , notes , call sheets , camera reports , continuity notes , costume designs , laboratory reports , treatments , set designs , choreographic notation , sound designs , etc . external documentation perhaps has greater resonance in live performance practices . while screen media practices produce some form of object outcome(s ) or artefact(s ) that can be revisited ( albeit in different ways and not necessarily in perpetuity ) , live performance by definition is ephemeral . ' the ' performance encounter exists through specific temporal - spatial contexts with no possibility of object repetition . external documentation ( whether photography- , audio- , video- , text - based , etc . ) therefore suggests the documenting of performance encounters in such a way as to reference the possible contents of the performance as research . this is problematic in that such external documentation ( particularly video - based documentation ) frequently does not acknowledge the tendency for such documents to be seen as ' standing in ' for the practice itself . parip has produced its own documents that explore best practices for such external documentation of live performance . click here for more information what is the difference between ' mediated ' & ' mediatized ' ? parip acknowledges that all ' translations ' of practice are mediated , in that to mediate is to act as a medium that transfers something from one place to another , to be between two stages , ideas , times or things . parip is concerned with practice as research in both live and mediatized areas of activity . here mediatized speaks to that which pertains to ' media ' , the standard dictionary definition of which refers to various means of mass communication : including television , radio , magazines and newspapers , together with the people involved in their production . however , the word ' mediatize ' was introduced popularly in jean baudrillard 's ' for a critique of the political economy of the sign ' , from jean baudrillard : selected writings ( mark poster , ed . , 1990 , cambridge : polity press , pp . 57 - 97 ) ; is used by philip auslander in liveness : performance in a mediatized culture ( 1999 , london : routledge ) ; and is discussed in further detail in caroline rye 's living cameras : a study of live bodies and mediatized images in multi - media performance and installation art practice ( 2000 , unpublished phd thesis , edinburgh : napier university ) . mediatize thus extends beyond the media ' industry ' cited above to reference ' the image - orientated technological machinery by which " the media " originates its mass communication , specifically video , film and photography ' ( rye 2000 : 11 ) . thus ' mediatize ' suggests the recording of images in association with camera technologies , by which they enter into economies of exchange ( see particularly peggy phelan , 1993 , unmarked : the politics of performance , london : routledge ) . while live performance may mobilize that which is mediatized ( the use of various camera images in the live event ) , live performance may perhaps be understood as encounters that take place in temporal and spatial relationships with an audience , whereby the performance is not given meaning specifically through the production of image - orientated artefacts . click here for more information why does parip focus on academy - based practice as research ? parip arose from a specific history of debates surrounding the institutional inclusion of practice as research within academic research agendas . the context is historically one of funding and its links to assessment of the tertiary education sector . there is also the acknowledgement that certain epistemological issues can only be addressed in and through practice , rather than through traditional critical writing based research . click here for more information why does parip focus on advanced research , as opposed to postgraduate research ? parip 's research remit , as set out in its application to the ahrb ( http://www.ahrb.ac.uk ) , is to detail the full range and major types of approach to practice as research in uk higher education institutions , in the context of advanced research and the research assessment exercise ( http://www.rae.ac.uk ) . palatine ( http://www.lancs.ac.uk/palatine/ ) , the uk council for graduate education ( http://www.ukcge.ac.uk ) and the subject - orientated professional bodies covering higher education : scudd ï¿½ standing conference on university drama departments ( http://art.ntu.ac.uk/scudd/ ) , scodhe ï¿½ standing conference on dance in higher education and ampe ï¿½ association of media practice educators are more specifically concerned with postgraduate and learning and teaching issues . what is parip 's standing in relation to the ahrb & rae ? parip is a five - year research project , funded by the ahrb . it does not function as an evaluation or assessment panel . furthermore , it does not engage in project - funding activities . click here for more information what is parip 's remit ? parip 's successful ahrb application outlined the following context for the research , methods of project activity and costs / organization ( edited for length ) : context the pursuit of practice as research has become increasingly important during the past ten years to the research cultures of the performing arts and related disciplines involving performance media as the contribution of the arts and cultural industries to national health and prosperity has climbed up the political agenda . a growing numbers of performing arts / media departments in he are now offering higher degrees which place practice at the heart of their research programmes . the main professional association representing drama , theatre and performance in he , scudd , in 1994 established a working party to draw up guidelines on practice as research , and in the 1996 rae the drama , dance and performing arts panel ( uoa66 ) for the first time included it as an area of research fully equivalent to traditional approaches . the debates around the nature of that ' equivalence ' subsequently have grown in intensity . the department of drama at the university of bristol is exceptionally well placed to undertake the first major research project to focus on practice as research . both departmental professors have extensive and complementary experience of successful practice as research projects , and both have chaired the scudd working parties . baz kershaw 's creative practice has included : the initiation of a new genre ï¿½ reminiscence theatre ï¿½ in the 1970s , which has since been taken up internationally ; creative documentation projects with welfare state international in the 1980s/90s ; performative investigations of contesting histories a heritage sites in the 1990s . martin white is a leading figure in practical research methodologies , particularly for investigating renaissance theatre history ; at bristol he has built the only full scale reconstruction of a jacobean indoor playhouse ; the international reach of his work has been extended through his association with london 's globe theatre . these contrasting approaches to practice as research are augmented by the research of bristol 's academic staff , with work spanning drama , theatre , film , video and television . a recent full upgrading of the department 's television systems to digital format , and a major refurbishment of its physical facilities provide an excellent environment for this project , but particularly for the work of parip 's practical project strand . well established links with the university 's department of computer science and the institute of learning and research technology will ensure the highest standards in the digital aspects of the project . an agreement in principle has been reached with advisory group member , christopher bannerman , head of rescen ( centre for research into the creative and performing arts ) at middlesex university , for a collaboration which will provide the dance elements of this project . methods the proposal is for a five - year departmental project led by baz kershaw and janet thumim ( departmental head ) , with one ft and one pt research associates , and occasional fee - paid technical / computing support staff . the group , with support from departmental academic , production , technical , administrative and secretarial staff , will coordinate the development and mutual reinforcement of the three strands of project activity . an inter - institutional steering group of senior researchers , chosen for their experience in contrasting types of practice as research , advises the department on the progress of the project as a whole . parip 's field research will produce a complete survey of practice as research in uk heis . this will lead to a national symposium on the findings aimed to refine and enhance their organization / presentation for use by the research communities ( completed november 2001 ) ; detailed multi - media case studies of selected ' representative ' practices from a range of heis , aimed to investigate the most effective approaches to documentation / dissemination ; a website ( initial stages on - line in november 2001 ) will broadcast the database and case studies , promoting debate in preparation for a national conference on the future of practice as research ( to take place 11 - 14 september 2003 ) ; a survey of selected european heis will extend the database and case studies , and lead to a european / international conference on cross - cultural approached to practice as research . parip 's critical research will produce working papers on the key issues in performance arts and media relevant to practice as research [ link to historiography paper and incorporating paper ] . this will be developed to initiate debate about the various theoretical frameworks that might best inform practice and analysis in the major types of practice as research project , through a seminar series with leading practitioners in the field . three to four regionally based inter - institutional working groups will develop the theoretical frameworks in the light of selected practices in their areas , cross - referenced with the case studies and draw up draft criteria relevant to different types of approach ; a continuous on - line symposium will map out the relationships between theories and criteria to form the first comprehensive account of the interaction of scholarship and creative achievement in practice as research ( parip@jiscmail.ac.uk ) . parip 's practical research is a series of creative projects based mainly in bristol in key areas of concern to practice as research , which will provide a platform for investigation into advanced uses of new digital technologies for the documentation and dissemination of processes and outcomes . the projects will focus on fields of concern already well developed by practitioner - researchers , by engaging with key issues of historiography . likely projects include : historical theatre reconstruction , multi - media performance , cross - cultural dance , community - based documentary video . initially this research will focus on innovative technical applications of video - based digital recording for simultaneous multi - viewpoint documentation . bristol already has much of the equipment needed for such a system . the aim will be to create a digital documentation system for parip that will a)produce high quality multi - media , multi - stream material and b ) be available for use as a high - quality ' add - on ' in heis . hence the initial development of this system will take place in bristol , but with the intention that as the project develops it will be available to other heis . costs and organization project costs derive primarily from the salaries for the research associates , though the documentation system produces a significant part of the budget . the full - time ra will be responsible for the overall coordination of all aspects of the project . it is envisioned that most of her time will be spent working to conduct the field research and service the seminars , conferences and on - line information sources with high - quality materials . hence , in y1 most of her work will be office - based , but as the project develops she will be involved in travel to coordinate work between heis . the half - time ra will be responsible primarily for the coordination of the practical research , in particular the development of the technical resource and its uses . hence , in y1 and 2 the majority of her work will be spent on technical coordination between departmental research and production staff . later in the project she will be involved in coordinating and servicing the use of the system in other heis . she will also be responsible for coordinating the work of fee - paid technical and computing staff bought into the project . the university of bristol will make substantial contributions to the project , and this is reflected in the reduced amount of grant requested in the bid ( compared with first submission ) . the department of drama will provide all secretarial support needed for parip 's activities , and much of the costs of technical production staff for the practical research . the department of computer science and institute for learning and research technology will provide the majority of computing expertise , as the nature of the project coincides with their developing research interests . copyright clearances for most materials produced by the project will be an integral part of the terms of collaboration , though the budget allows for some small copyright costs on materials that may be imported . hei departments participating in working groups , seminars , case studies , etc . will contribute to the costs of those elements ._. _ _ we aim to dispatch all ordersreceived by 3 pm , on the day of receiving the order . however in peak holiday times etc , this may not be possible , but it will be dispatched as swiftly as possible , subject to stock availability and cleared payment . our couriers aim to provide a next working day service , but do not guarantee this , simply because the uk 's roads have become increasingly congested . however , if your parcel has not arrived after 2 working days ( mainland uk ) , please call us and we will contact the couriers on your behalf . note : normal delivery service is to mainland uk , excludes the highlands of scotland , northern ireland , channel islands and i.o.w. stock availability we will advise you when ordering if an item is out of stock . due to our huge range we sincerely regret that we can not ensure permanent availability of all items , although we do our best . our buyers are constantly updating current and new orders . proposed lead times from our supplier can be delayed due to issues beyond our control . however , we 'll always give you estimated delivery date and call you once it has arrived in our warehouse . we do not charge for orders until they are actually dispatched ._. _ _ plasma fibrinogen , haemostatic factors and prediction of peripheral arterial disease in the edinburgh artery study smith , f.b. and lee , a.j. and hau , c.m. and rumley , a. and lowe , g.d.o. and fowkes , f.g.r.

116 iu / dl versus 104 iu / dl , p less than or equal to 0.05 ; respectively ) . after adjusting for age and sex , fibrinogen ( p less than or equal to 0.01 ) and vwf ( p less than or equal to 0.05 ) were significantly associated with the risk of developing pad . the association between fibrinogen and development of disease remained after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors and baseline ischaemic heart disease ( relative risk , 1.35 , 95 % confidence interval 1.05 , 1.73 ; p less than or equal to 0.05 ) . none of the haemostatic factors were significantly associated with progression of pad . in conclusion , plasma fibrinogen levels are related to the future onset of pad , providing further evidence of a possible role of elevated fibrinogen in the development of atherosclerotic disease ._. _ _ the liverpool telescope is the world 's largest fully robotic telescope . it is a 2-metre optical telescope sited adjacent to the ing on la palma in the canary islands . the telescope is owned and operated by the astrophysics research institute ( ari ) of liverpool john moores university ( ljmu ) . funding for the project came from a number of sources including pparc , ljmu , the eu and a private donation from mr aldham robarts . 40 % of the observing time is available to astronomers throughout the uk ; a further 5 % of the time has been donated by ljmu to the national schools ' observatory ( nso ) programme . the telescope was designed , constructed and commissioned by telescope technologies ltd in liverpool . the liverpool telescope 's unique capabilities of flexible scheduling and rapid response enables new fields of research in time domain astrophysics . scientific impact the liverpool telescope monitors variable objects on timescales of years to seconds ; this enables objects such as comets and near - earth asteroids to be tracked . it can observe unpredictable phenomena such as gamma ray bursts and supernovae and undertake small - scale surveys and follow - up for other telescopes and space missions such as nasa 's swift mission . strategic priority the uk is at the forefront of robotic telescope design and flexible scheduling development . through its unique rapid response capability , the liverpool telescope provides a vital contribution to the origin and physics of gamma ray bursts and other astronomical phenomena . the science goals of the liverpool telescope also address some of pparc 's key astronomical questions in planetary system evolution and cosmology . the telescope plays an important role in pparc 's science and society programme ; being one of the first world - class telescope to grant access to schools . track record the liverpool telescope enabled the uk to be at the forefront of robotic telescope design and build . momentum the liverpool telescope is currently considering proposals to the fourth semester of telescope allocation time . the liverpool telescope has also joined with the faulkes telescopes to form robonet , a network of robotic telescopes . future plans are being considered to increase this network by building more telescopes . uk involvement the liverpool telescope project was conceived , designed and built in the uk through the ljmu research group and telescope technologies ltd. a number of other uk groups such as imperial college london , manchester and southampton universities were involved with the design and build of some of the telescope instrumentation ( ratcam , supircam and frodospec . ) it is also accessed by uk schools and the public via the nso and the liverpool museums . cost pparc contributed 174k pounds to the operation of the lt in 2005/06 ._. _ _ dear all , i have just had an amazing success with a herb ( a root ) called black cohosh ( for my night sweats ) . however , i read an article that reminded me that we should always check whether or not the herbs or supplements we are taking are compatible with prescription meds . i have checked out my particular " cocktail " and black cohosh and , fortunately they are compatible . however , i think we should all check out the compatibility , if we are taking herbs / supplements and prescription meds . the web sites that can tell you are : www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed and www.pccnaturalmarkets.com the easiest way to access them is to highlight them here , go to edit , click on copy , go to the search space at the top of your screen and click there with the mouse then click on paste , then return ( or go ) and - voila - you should be there . love josette replies jan at painsupport 02/11/2005 this is a useful topic , josette , so thanks . i could n't find reference to drug / herb interactions on the websites you mentioned , they must be buried in the depths somewhere ! i found a few more here : http://www.healthcastle.com/herb http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/herbal-supplements/sa00039 http://www.holistic-online.com/herbal-med/hol jan josette ( u.k. ) 03/11/2005 email : josettemo@aol.com dear jan , both sites ( after working my way through a maze lol ) came up with " no adverse reactions recorded " . i think that this actually means that no one has done the research yet . i think it would be a mistake to take any soya based menopausal supplements on top of hrt cos you could be getting an overdose of oestrogen ( which can be dangerous , e.g. re breast cancer ) , but black cohosh seems o.k. ( i hope ) ._. _ _ william pitt was born at hayes near bromley , kent on 28th may 1759 . he suffered from poor health and was educated at home . his father , william pitt , earl of chatham , was the former m.p. for old sarum and one of the most important politicians of the period . the earl of chatham was determined that his son would eventually become a member of the house of commons and at an early age william was given lessons on how to become an effective orator . when william was fourteen he was sent to pembroke hall , cambridge . his health remained poor and he spent most of the time with his tutor , the rev. george pretyman . william , who studied latin and greek , received his m.a. in 1776 . william grew up with a strong interest in politics and spent much of his spare time watching debates in parliament . on 7th april 1778 he was present when his father collapsed while making a speech in the house of lords and helped to carry his dying father from the chamber . in 1781 sir james lowther arranged for william pitt to become the m.p. for appleby . he made his first speech in the house of commons on 26th february , 1781 . william pitt had been well trained and afterwards , lord north , the prime minister , described it as the " best speech " that he had ever heard . soon after entering the house of commons , william pitt came under the influence of charles fox , britain 's leading whig politician . pitt joined fox in his campaign for peace with the american colonies . on 12th june he made a speech where pitt insisted that this was an " unjust war " and urged lord north 's government to bring it to an end . pitt also took an interest in the way that britain elected members of parliament . he was especially critical of the way that the monarchy used the system to influence those in parliament . pitt argued that parliamentary reform was necessary for the preservation of liberty . in june 1782 pitt supported a motion for shortening the duration of parliament and for measures that would reduce the chances of government ministers being bribed . when lord frederick north 's government fell in march 1782 , charles fox became foreign secretary in rockingham 's whig government . fox left the government in july 1782 , as he was unwilling to serve under the new prime minister , lord sherburne . short of people willing to serve him , sherburne appointed the twenty - three year old pitt as his chancellor of the exchequer . fox interpreted pitt 's acceptance of this post as a betrayal and after this the two men became bitter enemies . on the 31st march , 1783 , pitt resigned and declared that he was " unconnected with any party whatever " . now out of power , pitt turned his attention once more to parliamentary reform . on 7th may he proposed a plan that included : ( 1 ) checking bribery at elections ; ( 2 ) disfranchising corrupt constituencies ; ( 3 ) adding to the number of members for london . his proposals were defeated by 293 to 149 . another bill that he introduced on 2nd june for restricting abuses in public office was passed by the house of commons but rejected by the house of lords . in parliament he opposed charles fox 's india bill . fox responded by making fun of pitt 's youth and inexperience and accusing him of following " the headlong course of ambition " . george iii was furious when the india bill was passed by the house of commons . the king warned members of the house of lords that he would regard any one who voted for the bill as his enemy . unwilling to upset the king , the lords rejected the bill by 95 votes to 76 . the duke of portland 's administration resigned and on 19th december , 1783 , the king invited william pitt to form a new government . at the age of only twenty - four , pitt became britain 's youngest prime minister . when it was announced that pitt had accepted the king 's invitation , the news was received in the house of commons with derisive laughter . pitt had great difficulty finding enough people to join his government . except for himself , his cabinet of seven contained no members of the house of commons . charles fox lead the attack on pitt and although defeated in votes several times in the house of commons , he refused to resign . after building up his popularity in the country , pitt called a general election on 24th march , 1784 . pitt 's timing was perfect and 160 of fox 's supporters were defeated at the polls . pitt himself stood for the seat of cambridge university . pitt now had a majority in the house of commons and was able to persuade parliament to pass a series of measures including the india act that established dual control of the east india company . pitt also attacked the serious problem of smuggling by reducing duties on those goods that were mainly being imported illegally into britain . the success of this measure established his reputation as a shrewd politician . in april 1785 pitt proposed a bill that would bring an end to thirty - six rotten boroughs and to transfer the seventy - two seats to those areas where the population was growing . although pitt spoke in favour of reform , he refused to warn the house of commons that he would resign if the measure was defeated . the commons came to the conclusion that pitt did not feel strongly about reform and when the vote was taken it was defeated by 248 votes to 174 . pitt accepted the decision of the commons and never made another attempt to introduce parliamentary reform . the general election of october 1790 gave pitt 's government an increased majority . for the next few years pitt was occupied with britain 's relationship with france . pitt had initially viewed the french revolution as a domestic issue which did not concern britain . however , pitt became worried when parliamentary reform groups in britain appeared to be in contact with french revolutionaries . pitt responded by issuing a proclamation against seditious writings . when pitt heard that king louis xvi had been executed in january 1793 , he expelled the french ambassador . in the house of common 's charles fox and his small group of supporters attacked pitt for not doing enough to preserve peace with france . fox therefore blamed pitt when france declared war on britain on 1st february , 1793 . pitt 's attitude towards political reform changed dramatically after war was declared . in may 1793 pitt brought in a bill suspending habeas corpus . although denounced by charles fox and his supporters , the bill was passed by the house of commons in twenty - four hours . those advocating parliamentary reform were arrested and charged with sedition . tom paine managed to escape but others such as thomas hardy , john thellwall and thomas muir were imprisoned . pitt decided to form a great european coalition against france and between march and october 1793 he concluded alliances with russia , prussia , austria , spain , portugal and some german princes . at first these tactics were successful but during 1794 britain and her allies suffered a series of defeats . to pay for the war , pitt was forced to increase taxation and to raise a loan of ï¿½ 18 million . this problem was made worse by a series of bad harvests . when going to open parliament in october 1795 , george iii was greeted with cries of ' bread ' , ' peace ' and ' no pitt ' . missiles were also thrown and so pitt immediately decided to pass a new sedition bill that redefined the law of treason . britain 's continuing financial difficulties convinced pitt to seek peace with france . these peace proposals were rejected by the french in may 1796 and william pitt once again had to introduce new taxes . this included duties on horses and tobacco . the following year pitt introduced additional taxes on tea , sugar and spirits . even so , by november 1797 , britain had a budget deficit of ï¿½ 22 million . on several occasions pitt was in physical danger from angry mobs and he had to be constantly protected by an armed guard . pitt 's health began to deteriorate and newspapers began reporting that the prime minister had suffered a mental breakdown and was insane . pitt responded by passing new laws that enabled the government to suppress and regulate newspapers . britain 's financial problems continued and in his budget of december 1798 william pitt introduced a new graduated income tax . beginning with a 120th tax on incomes of ï¿½ 60 and rising by degrees until it reached 10 % on incomes of over ï¿½ 200 . pitt believed that this income tax would raise ï¿½ 10 million but in fact in 1799 the yield was just over ï¿½ 6 million . james gillray , william pitt 's policy of income tax ( 1799 ) in 1797 pitt appointed lord castlereagh as his irish chief secretary . this was a time of great turmoil in ireland and in the following year castlereagh played an important role in crushing the irish uprising . castlereagh and pitt became convinced that the best way of dealing with the religious conflicts in ireland was to unite the country with the rest of britain under a single parliament . the policy was unpopular with the borough proprietors and the members of the irish parliament who had spent large sums of money purchasing their seats . castlereagh appealed to the catholic majority and made it clear that after the act of union the government would grant them legal equality with the protestant minority . after the government paid compensation to the borough proprietors and promising pensions , official posts and titles to members of the irish parliament , the act of union was passed in 1801 . george iii disagreed with pitt and castlereagh 's policy of catholic emancipation . when pitt discovered that the king had approached henry addington to become his prime minister , he resigned from office . although pitt had been paid ï¿½ 10,500 a year as prime minister , he was now deeply in debt and for a while he feared that he would be declared bankrupt . a group of friends agreed to help but it was only after selling his family home that he was able to satisfy his creditors . in may 1804 henry addington resigned from office and once again william pitt became prime minister . lord castlereagh was appointed secretary for war but many leading politicians , including charles fox , refused to serve under pitt . out of the twelve man cabinet , only pitt and castlereagh were from the house of commons . with napoleon planning to invade england , pitt quickly formed a new coalition with russia , austria and sweden . when the french were defeated at the battle of trafalgar on 21st october 1805 , pitt was hailed as the savior of europe . however , napoleon fought back and in december , 1805 he triumphed over the russians and austrians at austerlitz . pitt was devastated by the news of napoleon 's victory and soon after was taken seriously ill . william pitt died on 16th january , 1806 . he was so heavily in debt that the house of commons had to raise ï¿½ 40,000 to pay off his creditors ._. _ _ bradford 's community radio station the university is organising regular five -

by interfering with the perceptual filters ( white paint and road signs ) we force the driver to make his own judgements . adams came to public notice when he published a paper which suggested that seat belt laws had failed to save lives wherever they had been tried . the government did not believe this , so the commissioned the isles report - which showed that adams was right . this was against policy , so was buried , and the law was introduced anyway . it failed to save lives . risk compensation is now a mainstream idea and few even attempt to deny that it exists . although it ca n't be proved by formal scientific method ( that would essentially require the proof of a negative , which ca n't be done ) , experiments such as the munich taxi driver experiment have repeatedly produced results which support adams ' theory . risk is a must -

" summerton mill is the brainchild of pete bryden , a creative entrepreneur , and ed cookson , a filmmaker , who produced the series in the studio at colin sanders innovation centre , banbury , oxford . the series first aired in september 2005 on cbbc 's flagship pre - school programme tikkabilla and was inspired by a combination of the creators ' admiration for classic stop - frame animation series of the late 1960s and early 1970s as well as pete bryden 's own secluded 17th century stable ( called somerton mill ) , nestled in 7 beautiful acres of water meadow , woodland , river , ponds and islands in rural oxfordshire . the result is a modern take on fondly remembered shows such as bagpuss , camberwick green and the magic roundabout and has produced something of an instant classic as viewers will discover to their delight as they are introduced to characters such as dan and his dog , fluffa , the delightfully named mousey tongue - an old cat that is happy to while away its days lazing in the sun , francoise the montbelliard cow ( who moos in french ) , some chickens and the millfreaks -small furry creatures that scamper about summerton valley diving in and out of burrows . local residents dr naybhur and his wife live a little way up the track , and they all add to the rustic charm of this idyllic setting which we only have to leave when the oocuck , who lives in the oocuck sundial , chirps twice . ï¿½ i had an idea for a while that i 'd like to do stop frame animation because i liked the feel of those old animations like camberwick green and trumpton ï¿½ says pete bryden . ï¿½ but i 'd never done anything like this before . ï¿½ curiously , pete did n't rush out and buy a load of books on stop - frame animation . ï¿½ we did n't even know what materials to use , but that was part of the fun of it . we did n't think it was going to be that difficult and i knew i had the ability to do sets and paint backdrops . ï¿½ in order to make his vision into reality , pete approached ed cookson who he 'd met some six months previously when ed was making a short film . ï¿½ i was doing a bit of ï¿½ extras ' work when i met ed and we 'd hit it off then , and i told him about the idea and said i 'd quite like to do it . ï¿½ the first thing they did was bought some software called stop motion pro that has the ability to take images once you 've captured them and stitch them together very simply . ï¿½ to test the software i made a very basic character with just a head , with no features and just a lump of wood for the body and just the legs . i decided when i was designing the characters that because there was n't going to be a lot of movement in terms of turning the hips and so forth that i would n't need too much sideways movement , so the hips were basically straight joints bolted into the body quite high up so there was quite a lumbering movement to them . ï¿½ they made a very basic version of that and walked it across pete 's bathroom floor with a camera set up . ï¿½ we spent a morning filming it and fiddling around with it , but once we 'd done that we knew that if we could walk a character convincingly , then as long as we had the characters looking right , we had the sets looking right and the backdrop looking right , we knew we could do it . ï¿½ some decisions then had to be made . both men needed to continue earning money so there was a limit as to actually how much time they could spend on the project . but they decided from the outset that they would make a complete pilot episode , with the attitude that it should be of a standard high enough to fit into a part of a series . ï¿½ once we 'd done a pilot episode we had to work out what we were going to do with it . ï¿½ says pete . ï¿½ we decided to take it to the bbc and wait for them to reject it before we went anywhere else . at that point we also got a third person involved in the production team who was ex bbc . judy owen . ï¿½ owen joined the bbc in 1975 and left in 1988 after having worked on the production panel for 8 years mainly in children 's programmes . her bbc credits include why do n't you , blue peter special assignment and we are the champions . she went on to set up , format and produce itv 's first digital programme for pre - school children called tiny time . ï¿½ judy was bit of a mentor and i 'd go to her and put ideas to her and ask her what she thought of them . ï¿½ ï¿½ we also sorted out the sizes of the buildings and how big the buildings in the background were going to be and we decided to take everything from the front set to the back set down by 50 % . ï¿½ the pilot episode was actually shot using two sets because they were so restricted by space . another thing they aimed for was to get as much detail as possible into the sets with the idea that this would be something that would appeal to both kids and parents alike . ï¿½ we wanted to make a little world that people would want to climb through the television set to get in to . ï¿½ with the sets built , the next step was to about build their own character models . they were bottom heavy with feet cast out of lead . light heads were built by pete out of builders foam ; squirted into a plastic bag and then carved into the shape of a head with pollyfillier and plenty of sanding down . ï¿½ trouble is after a lot of filming it went a bit soft and spongy . ï¿½ explained pete . ï¿½ when we got the commission we got scarycat down in bristol to remake the models for us and they wrapped the heads in latex and cast them in a light plastic and improved on the bodies putting ball and socket joints in where we had aluminium bundles of wire running through the arms . that now gave us sideways movement as well , which was a complete nightmare when we first started filming because now they moved in every different direction . ï¿½ the series uses a narrative , similar in style to the magic roundabout and the trumpton series made by smallfilms , rather than individual character voices . this is provided , as indeed it was in the pilot , by silas hawkins . ï¿½ i met him on a short film project and had a chat with him and mentioned that i wanted to do a stop - frame animation at some stage and he immediately told me that he did voice - over work and he was really interested . he sent me a cd with all these voices and i thought ï¿½ yeah , he 'd be really great ' of course , i did n't know who he was at that time and it was n't until much later that we found out that his dad was peter hawkins creator of the voices of the original bill and ben the flowerpot men , captain pugwash , the daleks , the woodentops and many other classics from the golden age of children 's tv . ï¿½ it took about five weeks to build the sets and puppets , but this was done over a period of several months . ed and i did the final set building and tweaking between us and , once we were happy ( and after a very deep breath ) we launched into the filming itself . it took us about 25 days to film the pilot episode , spread over a four month period . with the pilot episode wrapped up the next step was to approach the bbc . ï¿½ we sent a vhs copy of the episode off to the bbc and about two months later they called us back and said they liked it . ï¿½ they were invited up for a meeting and the three of them , pete , ed and judy , trouped up to london one october morning in 2003 taking with them the character models . they made an immediate impression on kate benbow , executive producer of pre - school programmes for cbbc , who explained : ï¿½ " they came in and just put their characters on the table . they clearly cared deeply about their audience and were dedicated to making the best possible product . i could n't help falling in love with them . their approach reminded me of trumpton and camberwick green , the programmes i loved when i was very young . " but in spite of the good first impression , it was soon made clear to them that the bbc 's position had changed somewhat since their initial first interest , as pete bryden recalls : ï¿½ we sat at the table with us one side and the bbc execs at the other with these characters in the middle . the first thing they said to us was that ï¿½ quite a few things have changed up here since we arranged this meeting and we have n't actually got the money we thought we would have ' . in spite of their interest , kate benbow and her colleagues would n't know where they stood with a proposed series of summerton mill until the following february . ï¿½ we told them that if they really liked it that much we were prepared to wait and that 's what we did . we went back to them in february 2004 and asked them again and they said ï¿½ sorry , we just have n't got the budget . ' so i came away from that meeting and spoke to ed and judy and we prepared some more tapes to send them out to other people . ï¿½ about four weeks later we were ready to send these tapes out when i decided to contact the bbc one more time . i wrote them a letter and about two weeks later they contacted me again and invited us back . so in may 2004 , ed and i went to see them and they commissioned thirteen episodes there and then . the bbc were great to deal with , they gave us a realistic deadline , we got half the budget up front when we signed the contract and the other half when we finished . ï¿½ ï¿½ so we were able to come out of that meeting and immediately start shooting . we took on an assistant animator , james cleland , who we picked up from the arts institute at bournemouth . we spoke to one of the main tutors down there and said ï¿½ have you got anyone down there who you think could get involved in this project ? ' and he recommended james who turned out to be brilliant . ï¿½ their meticulous attention to detail is evident throughout each four - minute episode . in one story doctor naybhur plays the guitar . this was strictly story - boarded with the hand in the right position for every part of the strum with the left hand moving in the right place for the chord changes . it 's no wonder that only 14 seconds of filming made it into ï¿½ the can ' every day . ï¿½ a third of the day would be spent getting ready for the shot and planning out the time - line absolutely rigidly so we knew exactly what was happening all the way through frame by frame , and then going through the big psychological barrier of getting psyched up and going into the actual film shoot , which is always a nightmare because it just went on and on and on and there 's always something that made it much longer than you 'd expected it to be . it was like the greatest endurance exercise we 'd ever been through . ï¿½ but it was worth it , because the fine attention to detail is evident throughout the production and makes the series , visually , very appealing , from the gravel on the path to the roofs on the buildings where they went as far as making roofing slates out of clay instead of the easier option of buying off - the - shelf materials , and building the roof using hooks of lead to hold them in place just like on a real roof . even the wood is from some 17th century floorboards that pete had at home . the entire series reaches heights in production quality that you would hardly expect for a children 's animated series . over the next twelve months ( nine of which were taken up by filming ) , the team were able to complete the 13 episodes that made up the series , a timeless collection of tales for the young and old alike , and especially reminiscent for those who thought that british television no longer made programmes like trumpton and chigley , or decided that it had given up on such delightful characters as windy miller or hugh , hugh , barney , mcgrew , cuthbert , dibble and grub . they , and their children or grandchildren will be delighted to discover a brand new generation of pleasantly enchanting residents of summerton mill , where every day the sun shines brightly and with every turn of the old water wheel a little magic and happiness is spread . return to top of page tune in to : these related kids corner shows and articles on this website : kids shows index kids shows a to c kids shows d to k kids shows l to s kids shows t to z kids toys recommended link further info and transmission dates can be accessed via the summerton mill website dan and fluffa . mousey - tongue . a millfreak . when the bbc ordered the series of ' summerton mill ' they asked the production team to cut two seconds from the introduction which heralds each story . the original intro went like this : " down at the bottom of a very pretty valley , there 's a magical place called summerton mill . but the stream that used to flow from the river to drive the waterwheel is overgrown , and the old millstones stopped grinding corn years ago . so there it stands , summerton mill , still beautiful in its tumbledown state - a home to the wild animals , the birds and the plants . but when it rains up on the hills , the river level starts to rise in the valley . the river spills over into the overgrown millrace and , very slowly , the old waterwheel starts to turn . and when the waterwheel turns at summerton mill , a little bit of magic takes place ... " pete bryden bought the original fluffa from a charity shop and ' chopped him about ' ( he was originally a bear ) to create him almost as he looks today . " he had a slightly angrier face than the fluffa we 're using now . " said pete . " i sat down and made some rough drawings . i did n't use anything for inspiration . i looked at the magic roundabout to look at things like walk cycles and we used the same method to get our models to walk , just to see the positions they used . but that 's as far as it went . then i just sat down and did some character drawings . " ed cookson and pete bryden inspiration : somerton mill latest news following a successful launch within tikkabilla , this charming stop frame animated series has returned to our screens . due to its popularity during the first screening in the autumn of 2005 , the bbc have given summerton mill its own transmission slot . the success story of summerton mill follows the path of morph and the simpsons , both of which started life within other programmes before becoming series in their own right . summerton mill was featured on cbeebies in the bbc 's flagship programme , tikkabilla , from september to december , 2005 . the series was then repeated on bbc2 . the new standalone series began transmission on cbeebies from april 1st 2006 . every saturday and sunday at 8.05am and 2.05pm_cd _ _ quarterly updates october -

determined hypocentres from national monitoring agencies , which often use region - specific travel time tables . we also compared focal depths with depths computed from pp - p times . using s times moved the isc 's hypocentres closer to these external standards on average , and moved very few of them away from the standards . for the isc , which uses nonlinear weighting to accommodate outliers , an important advantage from using s is improved stability in inversions for epicentres , origin times and focal depths . as shown in the figure at the right , in first three months using s arrival times , the proportion of events for which the isc could not compute an hypocentre was cut by more than 1/3 compared with the previous year . with additional constraint from s times , spurious convergence on local minima occurs less often . in addition , isc seismologists need less often resort to fixing depths and epicentres to reported values . this increases the proportion of events for which the bulletin includes epicentres computed using the isc 's globally consistent location procedures , weighting algorithm , and travel times . s times were introduced by modifying the isc 's existing location program . many of the modifications were made by chen qi - fu of the china seismological bureau , who worked at the isc for a year as a royal society visiting fellow . richard luckett made further changes to improve identification of regional s phases and ensure that s travel times are computed accurately . seismologists who follow developments at the isc may recall that chen qi - fu 's goal in modifying the isc location program was to use travel times from laterally heterogeneous earth models . consensus on a 3-dimensional mantle model may still be a few years off but , apart from the effects of subducted lithosphere , much of the variability in travel times is due to crustal structure . but richard luckett is investigating the effect that crustal corrections would have on isc hypocentres . results from his work using the mooney - laske " crust 2.0 " model are likely to be discussed during the isc 's governing council meeting at the iugg symposium in june . 2000 bulletin completed in early november the isc completed its analysis of the seismic events of 2000 . the total number of events for which the isc collected data grew from 152,000 in 1999 to 195,000 in 2000 . the increase was partly due to the honshu " mega - swarm " , which resulted in jma reporting twice the normally expected number of events for several months . but much of the increase was due to improved collection , which included establishing regular contributions from agencies in korea , ecuador , costa rica , syria , saudi arabia , iran , vietnam and more than a dozen other countries around the world . the isc also reached agreements for more complete bulletins from long - time contributors , including mining - related events from the geological surveys of canada and the usa , and teleseismic readings from the geophysical institute of israel . apart from japan , the most prolific swarm reported for 2000 was on the east pacific rise , but almost all of these events were too small to be recorded except by hydrophones . the seismicity of 2000 was also notable for numerous aftershocks following large earthquakes in sumatra during june and near new britain during december . the isc significantly improved its system for selecting the events of 2000 that were reviewed manually . the new system takes advantage of the isc 's own preliminary processing , which groups hypocentres and associates readings with events . even if no magnitude is known , the isc 's processing now gives us a good idea of how widely each event was recorded . most events reported without a magnitude are too small to be detected beyond a single network , and these are no longer reviewed . isc seismologists had to check only 45,000 events of 2000 to ensure that all reported m>=3 events and all multiply - recorded events were properly analysed . by comparison , 52,000 events of 1999 were manually reviewed at the isc . new cds include gui the isc 's annual bulletin and catalogue cds were released soon after analysis of december 2000 was completed . as last year , the new cds include bulletin files for the latest year in iaspei seismic format ( isf ) . in addition , however , this year 's cds include isf catalogue files back to 1904 . all of the data are also included in isc 's own " ffb " format , although these files are compressed . an exciting feature of the new cds is a version of " wizmap ii " . roger musson of the british geological survey ( bgs ) wrote the program , which runs under microsoft windows , and modified it to use isf files . wizmap ii can be used to make maps of epicentres from a catalogue , select subsets of those events by drawing polygons on the map , and analyse the magnitude distribution of the selected events . wizmap ii can write an isf file of the selected events , so it can also be used as a graphical user interface ( gui ) to select events for other programs that read isf files . the isc wrote files for the new cds by selecting data from its database rather than re - formatting the ffb files from previous cds . the advantage of this approach is that it includes recently collected data for older events . the most widespread newly collected data are the engdahl , van der hilst and buland ( ehb ) hypocentres for large events from 1964 to 1999 and located all over the world . the most numerous new data are the pmel hydroacoustic epicentres in the pacific ocean during 1996 to 2000 . some newly collected data on the cds are events recorded only by temporarily deployed seismometers , while others are new source parameters for events that were already in the bulletin . want an isc cd ? isc 's web site , http://www.isc.ac.uk/ , has several pages that may be of interest to cd users . to buy cds for libraries , the order form at /sales / cds can be posted or faxed to the isc . a pair of cds comprising the 2000 bulletin and 1904 - 2000 catalogue can be purchased for individual use for ï¿½ 10 at /sales / on - line.html . authors who have published recent papers that use data from the isc can get a free copy of the catalogue cd by completing the on - line profile at /users / profile.htm . enquiries by telephone , fax , post and e - mail are also welcome . isc posts maps on the web the isc has started providing custom - made maps to its web - site users , using software contributed by mission research corporation and science applications international corporation . users can obtain a map of the events that they selected in an on - line query by clicking on the phrase " make a map ! " , which is now printed near the top of each set of selected data posted by the isc web server . for now the maps only plot a single symbol at the prime epicentre for each event , using fixed scales for symbol size with magnitude and symbol colour with depth . but the software could be used to create " clickable " maps that might retrieve further information about individual events , or to prepare other maps such the stations that recorded an event or several epicentres for one event with their uncertainty ellipses . users can comment on the utility of the service or suggest maps that might be widely used by sending e?mail to suggestions@isc.ac.uk . project to transform " editing " concludes successfully collaboration between isc and reading university has resulted in a transformation in the way that isc seismologists work . tom bayliss of reading 's department of computer science worked at the isc for two years to develop a new editing system . the project was funded by the teaching company scheme , which is a uk government programme that aims to spread the use of british academic expertise beyond universities . tom is demonstrating his system in the photo at the right , using a bar code scanner to record edits . commands are scanned from a summary page . objects of each command , such as hypocentres or readings , are scanned from bar codes that are now printed in listings . advice from reading faculty with expertise in human - computer interaction helped in designing a listing format that could be scanned efficiently . the " coolest " part of the system comes into play when a seismologist makes a custom entry and links it to a particular event . tom built a simple , platform - independent of carrying out this complex task by using a web browser to interact with the seismologist and an internal web server to record the entry . an immediate benefit from the system is to eliminate the need for manually keying edit commands . this both frees up staff for other tasks and eliminates a potential source of error in analysis . further advantages are expected over time . the system might be extended , for example , to display a map of stations that recorded ( or failed to record ) the event that a seismologist is editing . further down the road , the system might be modified to include true decision support functions , such as showing results for provisional editing or suggesting the depth at which a poorly constrained event should be fixed . friends of robin adams , isc 's senior seismologist from 1978 to 1995 , may recall that he sometimes brought a listing home to edit in the evening while watching the telly . does the new system make such " family - friendly " editing a thing of the past ? temporarily , perhaps . but in light of ongoing developments in mobile computing , who could doubt that isc seismologists will someday use wireless scanners at home ? perhaps they will pop up a window on their digital tv from time to time to display a map , record a custom entry , or even consult with other seismologists !_. _ _ how to buy jewellery from suzarn.co.uk just browse our online catalog , and click on any items you wish to buy and add them to your shopping basket . after you have finished your selection , click on the checkout button on the shopping basket page and you will be asked for a few details that we need to be able to fulfill the order . we accept visa cards , mastercard , and switch cards . all credit card transactions are handled through a secure payment system on this site . postage and packaging orders with a value less than ï¿½ 30 : p&p : ï¿½ 3.00 . orders with a value more than ï¿½ 30 : p&p : ï¿½ 3.50 delivery schedule delivery takes one to five working days after the item has been sent out . we will let you know if it will take longer to supply a chosen item . guarantee suzarn jewellery are completely dedicated to your total satisfaction . every piece of jewellery is guaranteed unconditionally . if you are not completely satisfied with a purchase , we will exchange the piece or refund your money immediately . get in touch with us if you need to get in touch with us , please use the contact form on this website or give us a call_nn _ _ if you , your clients and guests have found our chester virtual stroll stimulating , you may also be interested in treating yourselves to one of our real chester guided walks . join us to wander the world famous city walls- the most complete in britain- and discover the delights of other parts of our lovely city as well . hear stories you 'll never find in a guidebook !
