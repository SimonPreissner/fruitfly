( i have just finished compiling a video , slides and printed material on how to write them , but these need to be reviewed before being available for distribution ) . the e&t committee have already led the way by producing ' best of 5 ' mcqs for spr assessment . those involved had a training day with prof allen . between regions , any duplication of cpd articles , in the sense that they cover almost the same area , is not a problem as we have both the cme journal and cpd on the web to cater for . regional cpd co - ordinators needed through the bgs office i have written to each region asking them to nominate an interested member to co - ordinate the production of cpd material at a regional level , someone who duncan and i can also refer to for dissemination of information , and from whom we can receive regional feedback . to start off , we need one cpd article per region per year ( more than 1 article would of course be welcome . you might wish to base the article on a local cpd meeting ) . the regions are best placed to know who has the specific expertise in their area to write cpd articles . please note that the writer does not have to be a geriatrician , but the content should be appropriate to our curriculum and the practice of geriatric medicine . please remember cpd is also about matters such as ethics and organisation of services , and not just the application of medical knowledge . as a guide , the article should be similar to the rcpl journal cme articles but the mcqs should be ' best of 5 ' and not true / false . the rcpl journal has about 5 articles per issue - 25 single side pages of cme with 10 questions with 5 t / f answers in each to assess the issue . its value is 2 cme points for 80 % correct . i would be grateful if the regional chairs would contact me through the subeditor , as to who the cpd co - ordinator for their region is . please give their name and email address , and get their agreement ! revalidation we await liam donaldson 's report on revalidation and re - licensing - we can not predict its recommendations but believe that cpd will continue to be central to demonstration by physicians that they remain up to date and fit to practice . in addition , other ways of demonstrating fitness to practice may be recommended , including multi - source feedback , patient satisfaction surveys and one 's success in meeting individual learning objectives . bgs scientific meetings bgs scientific meetings have traditionally been a good source for individual cpd point ' grazing ' , being sown with satellite symposia , plenary and parallel sessions . however , the federation of royal colleges is placing increasing emphasis on how we learn and whom we learn from . we need to reconsider learning methods and outcomes , and who influences the learning process . as a result of this , the following changes will apply to bgs scientific meetings : the federation has determined that , at any event , an individual can only be credited with a maximum of 6 hours cpd points per day . so , while you may attend a satellite meeting at 7.30 a.m. and work your way industriously through to 7.30 p.m. , you can only claim 6 cpd credits . ( i do n't know anyone who can take part in effective learning for 12 hours per day ! ) who we learn from and how they and we are influenced is also important . traditionally , satellite symposia have been booked by the pharmaceutical companies and the topic , speakers , site , provision , largely left up to them in consultation with the speakers . undoubtedly some of the symposia have been of sound educational value . equally undoubtedly some symposia have been greatly influenced by the pharmaceutical company . since i am now responsible to the federation for assuring the quality of our scientific meeting cpd submissions , i have to guarantee to the federation that neither the programme - format - structure - content , nor the speaker , have been influenced in any way by a pharmaceutical company . if we continue the present satellite symposia format this will affect both cpd accreditation and the extent to which the bgs depends on the scientific meetings financially . accrediting sponsored symposia i have written the following guideline for symposia outside of the main meeting : for any sponsored symposium to be considered for cpd points we must adhere to the requirements for recognition of cpd . that is , educational excellence and if drug companies are involved in sponsorship of the meeting in any way , that there preferably be more than one , that they have had no influence on the programme , topics or choice of speaker , that the meeting does not promote their products in any way , that the speakers have expertise in their field and have declared any outside interest which might compromise the independence of their presentation . all meetings which are not part of the main bgs scientific meeting must be submitted separately for consideration for cpd approval . i would have to add that both the federation and eugms are moving away from ' satellite symposia ' . this term does not engender any warmth nor sit well with them , as it implies that it is a meeting outside of the main meeting , as it in fact is . improving the quality of cpd and our scientific meetings i have had helpful feedback from members and the academic and research committee about the format , structure , content and delivery of cpd in its broadest sense . this relates to our scientific and local meetings . the a&r committee , by the time you have read this newsletter , will probably have constituted a subcommittee to look into this , with the blessing of ukmc . the feedback prompted me to write a short paper on the subject to help form the basis of future talks and also to produce videos , slides and articles on best of 5 mcqs and recommendations for slides . i am sure members will have much to contribute to more effective learning . the e&t committee and cpec are also up to date on this . more on this in future articles . drug company sponsorship we all recognise that pharmaceutical companies have a synergistic role to play in the work of the society . our scientific meetings depend on their input , your local meeting may also depend on them . where the problem comes is if there is undue influence on the structure , content and independence of the meetings ; where , for example , there is advertising on slides or stands inside a lecture theatre , where a fee has been paid to a speaker ( cpd - wise a modest honorarium is acceptable , a fee is not ) . this is a delicate issue and one that ukmc will probably address further . i am not writing on their behalf , this is my personal opinion . recording personal cpd there is increasing use of the online system , for recording personal cpd and applying for cpd recognition . remember to show evidence of reflection and that if the college has audited your cpd recently , they can audit it again next year , i.e. they do not stick to a 5-year cycle . there are further changes being planned . for a cpd scheme regulations update , including moving individual cpd 5-year cycles , exemption credits , minimum clinical credit requirements , and more information on all the items reported here , please visit the cpd news page on the bgs website . from northern ireland , i of course wish you a peaceful ( and prosperous ) new year . graze carefully . bliain nua faoi mhaise daoibh . ian taylor bgs director of cpd_nnp _ _ maya popovic ( llcm ) - voice and marko colak ( alcm ) - piano have both studied music at the london college of music . they have been working together for nearly nine years during which time they have developed a vast repertoire of songs , consisting of music of all genre , including - light jazz , pop ( disco ) music , songs from different countries such as spain , greece , latin america and france . as their country of origin happens to be former yugoslavia , they have based a large majority of their repertoire on music from this country , both traditional and modern . gypsy music -

the ' automatic pilot . ' by practicing chi sao , you learn how to use your body effectively . when you have been hit , you know that you have made a mistake - primarily , the objective is not to look for the hit , but to ensure that you do not get hit . this is practised in chi sao by teaching your body to move fast , get out of the danger and then counterattack effectively , without thought being involved . by doing this , chi sao is the perfect preparation for the fight . however , chi sao is not only aimed at fighting . it also teaches you how to deal with all kinds of stress . chi sao helps you to understand how to use your body naturally , effectively and bring out your intelligence . you have to remember that no one can teach how to fight - every fight is different . when soldiers train , they do n't kill each other but try to condition the body and mind up to the highest level so that if they need to go to war , they are prepared . when training wing chun : train hard , regularly and with the right school and you will be ready to use wing chun if necessary . wing chun will definitely bring out the best in you , in your relationships , your job , so that whatever you do , you will do it better . chi - sao is the essence of wing chun . it is the primary tool for the training of instantaneous response for which wing chun is so famous . it is through chi - sao training that the practitioner develops his sense of touch , to feel the flow of energy of the opponent , so he can absorb and neutralize the attack and counter . in chi - sao one must be like water , seeking the course of least resistance , avoiding the strong and attacking the weak . chi - sao integrates this sense of touch with the fighting techniques that the wing chun practitioner has mastered in the first 2 hand forms and the wooden dummy , so that all flow together and are applied without thinking , without waiting for the mind to make a decision on which defence or attack technique to apply , it is best not to apply the third form in chi - sao , because the third form is only for emergency use " save my ass " . feel the flow of energy of the opponent and re - act , be like water , seeking the least resistance , be direct , panic , move , and do not think ! through chi - sao the wing chun motto becomes real , received what comes , follow what goes , attack when there is emptiness or when the hand disengages . > > chi - sau poster guide above crispian farrow practicing chi sao with sosthene grosset -

time workers | other commonly used defences | an employer may seek to defend the difference in pay between a claimant and comparator on the basis that it is due to experience or length of service . in practice , service increments and long service benefits may discriminate against women who , on average , are likely to have shorter service than men due to breaks in their working lives due to child - care responsibilities . several cases have looked at this issue . for example : in danfoss [ 1989 ] irlr 532 , the ecj held that it is permissible to give pay increments on the basis of seniority without the need to show its relevance to the performance of the specific duties concerned , on the basis that seniority goes hand in hand with experience which generally places workers in a better position to carry out their duties . it was not necessary for the employer to give any specific justification for choosing to reward seniority . however , the court recognised that the application of the criteria of seniority may result in less favourable treatment of female employees given that many women will have entered the labour market more recently than men and are subject to more frequent career interruptions . danfoss has recently been approved by the eat in cadman v health and safety executive [ 2004 ] irlr 29 ( see below ) . a more stringent approach towards seniority was taken by the ecj in the later case of nimz v freie und hansestadt hamburg [ 1991 ] irlr 222 . it was held that , if the practice of rewarding seniority has the effect of discriminating against predominantly female employees , the employer must objectively justify the practice by reference to the experience gained in the job in question . the employer must show that the seniority was associated with actual improvement in the work performed . the court observed that although seniority usually goes hand in hand with experience , whether this amounts to objective justification would depend on the circumstances of the case . the employer 's argument that the practice was justifiable because , in general , full - timers acquired skills more quickly was rejected . in cadman ( see below ) the eat suggested that nimz does not apply where length of service is being used to justify a difference in pay between two full - time employees . in crossley v acas et/1304744/98 , male acas conciliators undertaking like work to female conciliators were at the top of the pay grade whereas the more recently recruited female conciliators were bunched at the bottom . the reason for this was that prior to 1992 conciliators had progressed up the scale incrementally each year on the basis of length of service and merit . however after 1992 progression on the basis of seniority was barred and therefore progression up the scale could only be achieved annually by relatively small merit payments . this meant that the claimant could never catch up with her comparators who were at the top of the scale , even though she had considerable length of service . acas sought to defend its system which was based on previous salary increments and now on the basis of annual appraisals . however under the annual appraisals the claimant had performed as well as her comparators . the tribunal held that the pay system indirectly discriminated against female conciliators with shorter service and could not be objectively justified on the facts . in cadman v health and safety executive [ 2004 ] irlr 29 eat , the claimant was employed on work rated as equivalent to four male comparators all of whom were paid more then her due to their length of service . the respondent accepted that the salary scale had a disproportionate impact on female employees but maintained that it was necessary to reward previous experience . the respondent further maintained that there was a correlation between length of service and experience as a general proposition . however , no attempt had been made to measure the impact of experience gained through seniority or to assess whether it added value to the respondent 's business . moreover , there was no evidence that the respondent had experienced difficulties retaining experienced staff . the tribunal held that the respondent had failed to justify the difference in pay , but that decision was overturned on appeal . the eat said that danfoss was still good law and that an employer does not have to provide specific justification for using length of service as a criteria in a pay system . it rejected an argument that nimz had superseded danfoss , saying that nimz applied to cases where length of service was used to justify differences in pay between a part - timer and a full timer not , as in cadman , where both the claimant and the comparator were full time . the eat 's decision is being appealed to the court of appeal which has referred the question to the ecj . in pepper v orpington caravan centre et/46194/96/b the tribunal considered it illogical to say that because someone starts with more experience , the less experienced worker can not catch the more experienced worker up . " indeed , that is a matter that happens in industry every day , so that a skilled worker who is aged 30 may well be paid the same as a similarly skilled worker aged 60 " . questioning a defence of seniority / experience if the employer relies on seniority / experience as a defence , relevant questions may be : to what extent are qualifications relevant to the work in question ? was the comparator 's experience a factor in the decision to employ him ? has the claimant gained the experience needed through on the job training and , if so , by what stage did she catch - up her comparator ? what is the gender breakdown of the claimant 's and comparator 's groups , ( to determine whether the pay practice has a disproportionate adverse impact on the claimant 's group ) ? if seniority does not account for all of the difference in pay , what proportion does it account for ? has any attempt been made to measure the impact of experience gained through seniority or to assess whether it adds value to the employer 's business ? is there any evidence that the employer has difficulty retaining experienced staff ?_. _ _ the sfca were delighted recently to add trustee status to the forth fisheries foundation ( fff ) in our growing public contribution on freshwater projects across scotland . during their october meeting , steve clerkin was accepted as trustee to the foundation to represent sfca in what fff chairman , alex fell , described as " tremendous support ensuring the foundations interest in all species throughout the forth were genuinely represented " . he further welcomed the expertise of the sfca as a " vital addition to the trustees " . the foundation was established on 18 th november 1999 and has registered charitable status with the principle purposes : to conserve and protect for the public benefit the freshwater and riparian habitats of the forth catchment used by migratory and other naturally occurring fish species . to promote and undertake research on which to base a programme of habitat enhancement and as a basis for education for all persons interested in fisheries resources and for improving awareness of conservation issues . the geographic area of activity will be the same as that covered by the forth district salmon fishery board and therefore includes the rivers forth , teith , allan , devon , leven , carron , avon , almond , esk and tyne . it is bounded by catchments of the tay , to the north , to the south by the tweed and to the west by the clyde . the sfca have also participated in an initial development meeting to determine content and priorities of a 5 year strategic plan . ( a full copy of the plan will be released on the fff website at a later date ) . this half - day working session , led by dr colin bull , ( executive manager and biologist to the foundation ) including representation from some 22 stakeholders from a broad range of local and national bodies , identified a principle set of 13 objectives / projects , which are also published in the plan . in what must surely be regarded as a true demonstration of a " habitats approach " where all species are regarded as of equal importance , the plans highest priority and first two projects have specific importance for scotland 's coarse anglers . the two projects are : 1 . assessing fish communities in stillwaters and deep river sections 2 . quantitative monitoring of stream fish communities what does all this mean for the coarse angling community ? the key points of significance in these holistic approaches for coarse anglers are : game and coarse species appear on the same agenda coarse fish are included in the overall fishery plans the promotion , protection and conservation of coarse species recognition for the growing importance of coarse angling as a community sporting pursuit the sfca will be directly involved in the project delivery as soon as the full text of the plan is published ( early november ) we will provide a link to it from the sfca site . so , the challenge for the foundation from here is to continue to secure funding in order to deliver on the plan . support so far is highly encouraging and it is no mistake that the plan is highly aligned with the requirements of the water framework directive and more locally , the stirling biodiversity plan . this will enable the foundation to attract financial contributions to deliver these projects as the incumbent experts . i 'd like to take this opportunity to thank the foundation for this opportunity and we are both delighted and excited to be working on these groundbreaking and scientifically based plans . we look forward to the next 12 months with much anticipation . regards steve clerkin - sfca secretary_nnp _ _ the skinny on bearskinrug bearskinrug was created in february of 2000 , as the personal site of kevin cornell . it currently exists in its fifth incarnation , and has drifted wide of mr. cornell 's original intention -- documenting the creation of his own deadly martial art . instead , it delivers the excruciatingly banal prose of kevin , houses his online portfolio as well as his shop , and displays the only existing picture of the author facing left . mr. cornell is currently accepting requests for freelance work . feel free to use the submittal form to the right . while he does n't require it , kevin does enjoy inquiries in the form of a limerick . of interest on the site you are more than welcome to explore the variety of distractions on bearskinrug . if , however , you wish to take the condensed tour , you might want to visit these popular spots : the pet bear 100 one - offs ( the cartoons of bearskinrug ) the bearskinrug sketchbook compositionals or , if you 'd like a couple suggestions of articles to start with , you might want to try : my cubbyhole mind the mojo boxing trilogy the stove is broken ! learning black & white james 's floatable derby much thanks deepest appreciation goes to jason santa maria and shaun inman , without whose advice and programming help this site would surely have never seen the light of day . thanks for all the help , gents ! syndication the following xml feeds are available for those who are hungry : the articles section : rss | atom the work section : rss | atom the links section : rss | atom the downloads section : rss | atom whereskinrug ?

one of the best uses of an illustration is as a visual " hook " . something to quickly catch the reader 's eye , intrigue them , and lead them deeper into the content . about an illustrator 's style illustrators generally cultivate one or two styles , that become their signature -- what makes them unique . what you 're looking for in an illustrator is someone whose style is best suited to the message you 're trying to get across . while working outside of a style ( or mimicking someone else 's style ) is not unheard of , when you hire an illustrator , be aware that their own personal style is inherent to their work . about an illustrator 's medium part of an illustrator 's style is dictated by the medium they work in . there are many different niches that different illustrators occupy . while some excel at large format paintings for poster reproduction , others might be more adept at vector art , acrylic paintings , or graphite . try and familiarize yourself with different mediums , so you can clearly communicate with the illustrator the look and feel you 're interested in . trade practices here 's some common terms and concepts to familiarize yourself with , if you plan to work with with an illustrator : copyright according to copyright laws , an illustrator inherently owns the copyright to his or her work upon creation . this copyright is actually a bundle of individual rights . if you plan to hire an illustrator , be aware there are certain rights that must be purchased in writing so they 're legally transferred . here 's some terms frequently used in contracts to specify portions of the rights bundle : one - time rights : client purchases right to publish illustration on a one - time basis first - rights : client purchases right to publish illustration first , usually on a one - time basis as well exclusive rights : client purchases exclusive right to publish within a particular market , for a contracted period of time . all rights : client purchases the entire copyright from illustrator . this transfer usually is for a specified time period , and can ( and should ) cost between 200 - 300 % of the price of the job . a credit line is usually required somewhere on the piece , acknowledging the illustrator . this line is usually in a form generally known as the notice of copyright . for further information on u.s copyright laws , international copyright laws , or the copyright bundle visit the u.s. copyright office website . cancellation ( kill fees ) an illustrator is considered to be working the moment pen touches paper . if a job gets cancelled halfway through production , it 's proper to pay the illustrator for the work they 've accomplished thus far . this is generally referred to as a " kill fee " , and commonly is paid in a percentage of either 50 % if preproduction work has been done , or 100 % if the finished illustration has been completed . rates and costs dependent on the medium , whether the art is black - and - white or color , and the placement of the job , an illustrator may charge with flat rates , hourly fees , or a combination of both . as is common with many other contractors in the design industry , an illustrator should be paid 50 % of their estimate before starting work . this creates an air of good - faith and shared responsibility between the two parties . if you 're unsure of current industry rates , consult the graphic artist 's guild handbook : pricing and ethical guidelines . rush fees in instances of tight turnaround , it 's not uncommon for a contractor to charge extra -- this is known as a rush fee . rush fees can be up to 25 to 50 % of the original estimate . generally a small job that requires turnaround in less than a week is eligible for a rush fee . what 's considered a small job ? well , a finished color spot - illustration would fall in that area . keep in mind that even simple stuff requires a rough concepting stage , and it would be more efficient to get approval on a roughed - up concept than a finished watercolor . a big job , like say , 4 finished 8 x 10 color illustrations , depicting a complex scene , would be estimated as a month , maybe two - month job . for the most part , the turnaround that triggers a rush fee will vary according to project scope . but as far as most illustrators are concerned -- if they have to work weekends , or nights to finish on time -- it probably justifies a rush fee . but these things are always negotiable ._. _ _ what it means to be a cat owner you will never read a newspaper on a sunny table again � or at least only the edges that a furry body does n't quite cover . you must practise saying , " oh , he 's never been up there before , " as if it were true , when your cat leaps onto the table to see what the dinner guests have left . there will never be peace in your home whenever you open a packet of ham or similar ; keen eyes and twitching noses will appear as if by magic . you will find yourself at the cat food section of your supermarket longer than any other , as you ponder which varieties he might � but only might � eat this week . in summer you will become over - protective of any bird , butterfly , bee or frog foolhardy enough to come into your garden . it 's important to learn to sleep with either bent or weighted legs , and to lengthen the time spent in one position . if you have more than one cat , it 's vital to remember which bits are a rubbing favourite for each . tickle the wrong bit , and you could have a hand nicely decorated with red scratches . accept that you may sometimes have a bottom nearly as hairy as his � because he will always prefer your chair . although you will have made good feeding arrangements when you go for a holiday , you will spend much time wondering whether your cat is deprived of love . he will let you know when you get back . you will become a good shot with a water pistol when the troublesome neighbourhood tom learns about the goodies available on the inside of your cat - flap . footnote : poppy , whose picture above illustrates this item , sadly lost her life in aug 2005 � read a short piece about her here . why do cats purr ? [ patrick wise , writing in bapla journal , 1995 ] my theory is this : it is part of a training programme . cats , as you know , are exceptionally intelligent creatures , much more so than humans in many cases . in days of yore ( whenever that was ) , they decided that working was for humans , dogs and carthorses , and most definitely beneath them . have you ever seen a cat yoked up to a plough , or pulling a sled ? of course not . no self - respecting cat would so demean itself . however , this poses the problem as to how they can live in the manner to which intelligent cats ( i.e. most of them ) wish to become accustomed . so for many years , cats have been studying humans , and training them to provide the essentials of life , such as heated cat beds , fresh salmon , full - cream milk and cat flaps . i ask you , who in their right mind would hack a hole in a perfectly good , solid , expensive door , just to install a cat - sized opening ? still , their observations and resultant training have been so successful that cats now enjoy even private medical care . and when their humans are away , they enjoy accommodation in top - class hotels with names like puss inn , the feline hilton and paws awhile . no human expense is spared . like royalty , cats never carry cash themselves , knowing that their fully trained humans will always provide . naturally , they do n't stoop to ' low ' human speech themselves , so they have devised a simple control system to convey their wishes to their humans , rather as farmers whistle at their sheepdogs . cats purrrrr their orders to humans . it is amazing how a cat can control its human by this simple technique . for a purr , humans will do almost anything , short of jumping through a flaming hoop - but maybe , with a little persistence , and if they really felt the need , they could get their humans to do that too ! fragments 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 if you would like to comment please contact me , return to feline fragments index other sections : famous felines feline fun fabled felines feline philately feline flotsam or visit the purr ' n ' fur home page our featured feline : your companion through the feline fragments section is maggie . she came as a kitten from powys cat rescue . one of their volunteers had earlier seen her wandering around , apparently uncared for , and thought her rather young to be just left to roam around . the person ' responsible ' for her said she ' did n't care ' , and so the youngster was taken in for rehoming . she was about 4 months old when i brought her home ; she seems a very self - assured soul , probably because of her early experience , and was soon climbing all the available trees in the garden . she has grown into a handsome and affectionate cat , with superb whiskers ; she spends a lot of time out and is a demon hunter . as the photo shows , she also loves getting into things !

" this clearly laid out and rational account is certainly a good step towards this in a way that no amount of left sloganeering , moralising or rhetoric ever will be . it 's also eminently readable . i have to confess that five hundred years into the iraq war as we are i was n't sure how much more there was left to be said on the subject . however , this book highlights how confused and muddled much of the anti - war movement has been and demonstrates with real clarity the need for not just the abc 's of anti - imperialism but the xyz 's as well . xyz 's we can only reach if we grapple with the issues as they really are without falling back on the dogma and algebra of the past . there are particularly useful sections on the history of imperialism in the region and of the us and pulls apart the lies upon which this war was based . it also helps clarify , i think , that the war was not wrong because it cost a lot of money that could have been spent elsewhere or that us and uk soldiers have been killed . after all if the war had been justified so would have been the cost - but that the war was wrong because it furthered the bloody aims of those whose interests standing in direct contradiction to those of the vast majority of the world . arnove says that we have to look to the vietnam war to understand the factors that can defeat the us government 's plans . he argues that the focus for the anti - war movement in the west should be to : confront the propaganda of the government and military build counter recruitment initiatives expose the war profiteers . support the soldiers who speak out or resist . work with these veterans . argue for an end to the occupation now rather than equivocate and compromise . the resistance to the war should , he argues , take on the fight on many fronts , but also that we should not " confine our marching to washington " or , of course , london . in fact the war against the war can only be won if we understand that there is no one centre to the movement and it is not single set piece events that will dig the resistance in deep enough to win . when arnove suggests that we " no longer confine our civil disobedience to the day after major mobilisations , when most protesters have gone home " he may be speaking to a specifically us audience but its resonances is felt very clearly for many anti - war activists in the uk . in my view this book is a real contribution to the anti - war movement and proves the case that there is space for rational depth in the movement as well as political width . speaking tour iraq : the logic of withdrawal is published by the new press . anthony arnove , will be speaking at the following events during his tour of britain : wednesday 14 june : oxford 7.30pm the vaults , st mary 's church , high street co - organised with east oxford stop the war coalition contact : dave 07985 056089 thursday 15 june : cambridge 6.30pm waterstones bookshop , sidney street , cambridge contact : jim 07956 605634 friday 16 june : london public meeting end the occupation now ! with anthony arnove , tariq ali & glen rangwala 7 pm , indian ymca , 41 fitzroy square , w1 see : www.iraqoccupationfocus.org.uk saturday 17 june : edinburgh 3 pm � 5 pm edinburgh stop the war coalition in association with word power sunday 18 june : glasgow 1 pm - 5 pm scottish tuc hall , 333 woodlands road glasgow " conflicts , occupation , civil liberties and media deception " speakers include : anthony arnove , muhamamd idrees ahmad , alan hart , rena bivens co - organised with glasgow stop the war coalition for information on either glasgow or edinburgh , contact gordon 0141 339 3323 monday 19 th june : nottingham , 7:30pm international community centre 61b mansfield road , nottingham for further information , ring ranjan on 07775 863750_cd _ _ babies are never too young for books . we 've got a selection of cot books and board books to get them started young . older kids will find something for them too - from classic children 's fiction to contemporary favourites . our range of cds , dvds , cassettes are great for use at home and especially good as distraction aids when travelling . something for the ladies here too with some useful parenting books ._. _ _ is voice therapy an effective treatment for dysphonia ? a randomised controlled trial mackenzie , kenneth and millar , audrey and wilson , janet a. and sellars , cameron and deary , ian j.

" beyond dull " ? " boring boring boring " ? " oh gods give me those two and a half hours of my life back " ? nothing seems to quite sum it up . i was expecting not to like this film . it opened with some writing about how " historians agree " that the legend of king arthur is based on an historical figure ; well , there 'll be agreement between clocks [ ten points for the emperor and/or novel ] sooner than amongst historians on arthur . i was expecting to sit there growling at the wrong sort of horses / armour / saxons . if only . the film billed itself as ( i paraphrase ) the real story without the romance . forgive me , but without the romance , there is no story here . do you want to spend two hours reading the welsh triads ? no , i did n't think so , because it 's only when chretien de troyes and co. get hold of the story that it becomes interesting . without the soap opera drama high romance that is arthur / morgaine / mordred and arthur / guinevere / lancelot , the story becomes nothing but a bad ( and spurious ) history lesson , and some even more spurious political posturing . ( considering , however , that clive owen is fit only to play sticks , tree - trunks and bookcases , the lack of any emotion might be a blessing in disguise . ) i want at this point to try to find some redeeming features . you know how badly i fancy kk , but whoever designed her stupid costumes ought to be shot . ray winstone is superb , but his comic relief just is n't enough to save this pile of crap . and there was some slightly clever little thing about how arthur got hold of excalibur ( no white samite -

term or long - term . you will be able to discuss this with your counsellor . what good can it do ? some of the benefits of counselling are that as you and your counsellor get to know each other , you will feel able to share , explore and then understand some of the difficulties you may be experiencing . as a result , you may begin to feel less anxious , or worried , or stressed . you may begin to feel stronger , better about yourself , and able to enjoy life more . does it mean there is something wrong with me ? many people think that asking for counselling means that � there is something wrong with them � , or that they � can not cope � , or that they are ' different � from other people . people also believe that they must deal with their difficulties on their own ( keep a stiff upper lip ) or that help is just not possible . this is understandable and true of most people , not just transplant patients . as a result of this , the decision to seek counselling can be difficult . however , taking such a decision can also be a very important first step . it can represent a person � s choice to get more out of life for themselves . will it be difficult ? if you decide to seek counselling , it may be helpful to remember that you will decide what to share with your counsellor , and that you will have their support at all times when working through difficulties together . what sort of things can be discussed ? transplantation may bring stresses that reach every facet of a persons life . there may be a family disturbance , a sense of isolation or of being a burden to others . there may be marital or sexual problems . there may be a sense of loss of independence and thus loss of control over one � s own life , which may lead to lowered self - esteem . self - image may be altered , hopes and plans for the future may be affected . there may be anxiety , depression and other intense feelings that are too difficult or embarassing to share with the people close to you . anything that is causing concern or interfering with your daily life and sense of well - being can be discussed , in complete confidence , with your counsellor . why do i need a counsellor when i have other people to talk to ? people are often helped through their difficulties by talking to family and friends . often this is enough to allow them to make decisions and resolve problems . sometimes though , experience has shown that there are times when it feels right , and works better , to seek help away from daily situations . the counselling service at the transplant unit provides a person -

house , as the landlord was accused of not allowing the boat to be used to rescue a man who had fallen into the canal reservoir and drowned . the man had been trying to retrieve a duck he had shot . the poet thomas campbell lived on peak hill between 1804 and 1820 . he regularly used the greyhound and would certainly have entertained some of his distinguished visitors ( who included sir walter scott , lord byron , george crabbe and sarah siddons ) at the inn . there is an account by sir charles bell ( a scottish surgeon ) of an evening spent with campbell at the greyhound when the poet returned home � not drunk , but in excellent spirits � . other accounts make it clear that there were occasions when he had to be helped home to bed . the greatest change to the area resulted from the passing of the enclosure act of 1810 . this proposed the enclosure of all common land in lewisham except for blackheath . from about 1820 what had been open common land from the greyhound to the top of sydenham hill was gradually built over . the croydon canal failed and the london & croydon railway company bought its assets . they built a railway , roughly along the line of the canal , which opened in 1839 . a station , almost adjacent to the inn , gave yet another boost to the greyhound . by 1870 sydenham had become a thriving and populous suburb and there was obviously a need for a more modern and prestigious inn . a major refurbishment took place and an extension added to what became the front of the building , facing kirkdale . much of the interesting detail of the inn dates from this time . the character of the greyhound inn has undergone a number of changes over more than 270 years . it has , at different times , provided strong refreshment for visitors to sydenham wells , been a meeting place for local huntsmen , refreshed those boating on the croydon canal , played host to georgian literati and quenched the thirst of clerks returning from their offices in the city . � steve grindlay historian to the sydenham society first published as a part of steve 's jottings in latter years the greyhound has lost its ' greyhounds ' at the door and spent a few sad years as ' the fewterer and firkin ' themed pub . it has now reverted to its original name though arena 's colour scheme is somewhat challenging . it still performs a civic duty on sky football nights when a good crowd gather and cheer - and a fiver for a couple of drinks makes it somewhat better value to some than paying to get into highbury or stamford bridge . there is an unconfirmed rumour presently circulating that the car park has been sold for redevelopment . the car park is one possible way disabled access could be provided to the london bound platform of sydenham station . we await news with particular interest ._. _ _ privacy policy netribution respects your privacy . any and all information collected at this site will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold , reused , rented , loaned , or otherwise disclosed in ways that you have not consented to . a more detailed explanation about how we safeguard your personal information is described below . if you have any questions , please do n't hesitate to let us know . this policy does not apply to the practices of companies that netribution does not own or control , or to people that netribution does not employ or work with . resale or disclosure of personal information to third parties netribution does not sell , rent , loan , trade , or lease any personal information collected at our site , including membership forms or email lists . general information that has been actively sent to us to publish on the site , such as event listings , festival dates , or film news , may be traded , leased , sold , loaned or rented to third parties , or reused on other netribution services , at the discretion of netribution management . browser information collected on the website netribution analyses our website logs to constantly improve the value of the materials available on the site . our website logs are not personally identifiable , and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals that actually browse the site . use of cookies we do not use cookies on this site . privacy of our email lists netribution maintains an email list . individuals must affirmatively ask to join our mailing lists by emailing joinemail@netribution.co.uk . we do not sell , rent , loan , trade , or lease the addresses on our list to anyone . in addition , we configure our list server software to refuse to divulge the email addresses of our list subscribers to anyone , including other list subscribers , with the exception of netribution staff . your ability to edit and delete your account information and preferences you may request deletion of your netribution newsletter subscription by sending an email to list@netribution.co.uk with the subject header ' unsubscribe ' at any time . your details will then be removed from our database . changes to this privacy policy netribution may amend this policy from time to time . if we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages ._. _ _ i have an epson stylus photo r800 i have tried hooking up to my pc . computer recognises it and starts printing but anywhere from 1 to 3 inches in it will shoot out the paper and continue shooting through blank sheets till out of paper . i have done all the epson suggestions in settings , uninstall and reinstall including clean install . have spent hours on phone with epson and microsoft to no avail . trying the printer on a different computer ( same basic setup and programs ) the thing works fine . main difference(s ) are the the compatible computer also has an epson stylus photo r1800 alreading working on it . other main difference is that the working computer is hooked to internet so gets all downloads , so i got the downloads for microsoft from ms and installed them on the not working computer .

" whoshouldicheerfor.com is a fun and interesting way to think about a serious issue , that of global poverty and inequality between the nations competing in the world cup . " when their favourite team is n't playing many people will want to shout for a country that has the odds stacked against them . some of the poorest countries in the world are playing in germany , let 's give them some support . " wdm has even produced an overall world cup supportability ranking for each country by averaging their position across all of the ten criteria . ghana comes out as on average the most supportable team with sweden second . at the other end the usa is the least supportable . benedict southworth said : " our world cup supportability rating is not an overall ranking of how ' good ' or ' bad ' we think each country is . it is intended to be a fun and interesting way to think about a serious issue , that of global poverty and the inequality between the nations competing in the world cup . people might want to choose one of the criteria that is particularly important to them when choosing who to support or they might just look at the average across all the criteria . " as well as learning about the countries taking part in the world cup anyone visiting whoshouldicheerfor.com can send an email to tony blair asking him to keep the promises he made to poor countries at last year 's g8 summit . benedict southworth said : " at its best the world cup is all about fun and uniting diverse people around the world behind a shared passion for the beautiful game . but we also want people to think about the massive poverty suffered by some countries competing , and demand that the richest countries keep the promises they made last year to do something about it . " ends notes : the world development movement was founded in 1970 . it campaigns to tackle the root causes of poverty . wdm believes that charity is not enough and aims to change the policies that keep the developing world poor . it is a democratic and politically independent organisation with 16,000 supporters and a strong role for 70 local groups across the uk . wdm was a founder of the fairtrade foundation , jubilee 2000 and make poverty history . contact : dave timms , senior press officer , wdm on 07711 875 345 or 020 7274 7630_cd _ _ from the outset it was obviously going to be busy on this , the last night of rx bandits uk tour . there was a queue all along the road before doors opened and by the time the headliners came on stage the place was packed . read full story ... | email | print the edge : 2006 nme new music tour : boy kill boy , � forward russia ! , the automatic , howling gigs like this one make me feel lucky to be alive today . there 's a lot of tripe and copy -

charles di negro . study of a woman the marquise de listomere is one of those young women who have been brought up in the spirit of the restoration . she has principles , she fasts , takes the sacrament , and goes to balls and operas very elegantly dressed ; her confessor permits her to combine the mundane with sanctity . always in conformity with the church and with the world , she presents a living image of the present day , which seems to have taken the word " legality " for its motto . the conduct of the marquise shows precisely enough religious devotion to attain under a new maintenon to the gloomy piety of the last days of louis xiv . , and enough worldliness to adopt the habits of gallantry of the first years of that reign , should it ever be revived . at the present moment she is strictly virtuous from policy , possibly from inclination . married for the last seven years to the marquis de listomere , one of those deputies who expect a peerage , she may also consider that such conduct will promote the ambitions of her family . some women are reserving their opinion of her until the moment when monsieur de listomere becomes a peer of france , when she herself will be thirty - six years of age ,-- a period of life when most women discover that they are the dupes of social laws . the marquis is a rather insignificant man . he stands well at court ; his good qualities are as negative as his defects ; the former can no more make him a reputation for virtue than the latter can give him the sort of glamor cast by vice . as deputy , he never speaks , but he votes right . he behaves in his own home as he does in the chamber . consequently , he is held to be one of the best husbands in france . though not susceptible of lively interest , he never scolds , unless , to be sure , he is kept waiting . his friends have named him " dull weather ,"-- aptly enough , for there is neither clear light nor total darkness about him . he is like all the ministers who have succeeded one another in france since the charter . a woman with principles could not have fallen into better hands . it is certainly a great thing for a virtuous woman to have married a man incapable of follies . occasionally some fops have been sufficiently impertinent to press the hand of the marquise while dancing with her . they gained nothing in return but contemptuous glances ; all were made to feel the shock of that insulting indifference which , like a spring frost , destroys the germs of flattering hopes . beaux , wits , and fops , men whose sentiments are fed by sucking their canes , those of a great name , or a great fame , those of the highest or the lowest rank in her own world , they all blanch before her . she has conquered the right to converse as long and as often as she chooses with the men who seem to her agreeable , without being entered on the tablets of gossip . certain coquettish women are capable of following a plan of this kind for seven years in order to gratify their fancies later ; but to suppose any such reservations in the marquise de listomere would be to calumniate her . i have had the happiness of knowing this phoenix . she talks well ; i know how to listen ; consequently i please her , and i go to her parties . that , in fact , was the object of my ambition . neither plain nor pretty , madame de listomere has white teeth , a dazzling skin , and very red lips ; she is tall and well - made ; her foot is small and slender , and she does not put it forth ; her eyes , far from being dulled like those of so many parisian women , have a gentle glow which becomes quite magical if , by chance , she is animated . a soul is then divined behind that rather indefinite form . if she takes an interest in the conversation she displays a grace which is otherwise buried beneath the precautions of cold demeanor , and then she is charming . she does not seek success , but she obtains it . we find that for which we do not seek : that saying is so often true that some day it will be turned into a proverb . it is , in fact , the moral of this adventure , which i should not allow myself to tell if it were not echoing at the present moment through all the salons of paris . the marquise de listomere danced , about a month ago , with a young man as modest as he is lively , full of good qualities , but exhibiting , chiefly , his defects . he is ardent , but he laughs at ardor ; he has talent , and he hides it ; he plays the learned man with aristocrats , and the aristocrat with learned men . eugene de rastignac is one of those extremely clever young men who try all things , and seem to sound others to discover what the future has in store . while awaiting the age of ambition , he scoffs at everything ; he has grace and originality , two rare qualities because the one is apt to exclude the other . on this occasion he talked for nearly half an hour with madame de listomere , without any predetermined idea of pleasing her . as they followed the caprices of conversation , which , beginning with the opera of " guillaume tell , " had reached the topic of the duties of women , he looked at the marquise , more than once , in a manner that embarrassed her ; then he left her and did not speak to her again for the rest of the evening . study of a woman page 02 honore de balzac part of our classic french authors section . a -

" the borvigilant and romina g collided . both vessels were damaged , and the tug 's skipper and some of its crew were lost . each ship claimed damages from the other , borkan for monsoon 's alleged negligence and breach of contract , and the tanker owner for negligence by borkan . monsoon also alleged the tug was unseaworthy due to borkan 's " want of reasonable care " , and that this caused the accident . losses claimed by monsoon included detention at kharg and fujairah , the cost of permanent repairs and associated delay . losses claimed by borkan included the loss of the tug , loss of her use and an indemnity against claims and legal expenses in respect of the lost seafarers . monsoon contended that borkan was not entitled to the benefits of the requisition terms as it was not party to them . if the terms did apply to borkan , then the indemnity in cl . 2(b ) was nullified by the unseaworthiness provisions in cl.4 . although the incident occurred in iranian waters , the parties agreed the consolidated actions should be decided in london under english law . at first instance , the admiralty judge , david steel j. , was asked to decide two preliminary issues as to liability . was borkan a party to the tug requisition form ? if so , did it protect borkan against liability for the losses claimed by monsoon if the borvigilant 's crew 's negligence caused or contributed to the collision ? what was the effect of cl.4 if the accident was caused by the tug 's unseaworthiness because of the owner 's want of due diligence ? 1 . was borkan entitled to rely on and benefit from the conditions in nioc 's tug requisition form � particularly cl.2(b ) , signed by romina g 's master ? 2 . if so , and if the collision was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the tug or its crew , was ( a ) borkan exempt from liability for the losses claimed by monsoon ; ( b ) monsoon liable to indemnify borkan for its losses ? the admiralty judge answered ( 1 ) : " yes " on the grounds that the agreement contained in the tug requisition form was made by the master of the romina g with both nioc and with borkan as borvigilant 's owner . he held that nioc had implied actual authority to contract on borkan 's behalf ; alternatively , borkan had ratified the contract following the casualty . as for question ( 2 ) , he found that both the exemption and the indemnity were effective , unless the collision was caused by a want of reasonable care to make the tug seaworthy , in which event neither the exemption nor the indemnity applied . monsoon appealed against the judge 's ruling on question 1 and borkan cross - appealed against his ruling in question 2 that the exemptions and right to indemnity in cl.2 were not available to borkan , " in the event of causative unseaworthiness attributable to the want of due diligence " under cl.4(a ) . judgment lord justice clarke gave a judgment with which his colleagues agreed . agency monsoon had submitted that two of four essential requirements ( per lord reid , midland silicones v scruttons [ 1962 ] ac 446 at 474 ) were not met . , namely a ) that the form did not make it clear that nioc was also contracting as agent for borkan , so that it could benefit from its terms and b ) it had not been shown that nioc had the tugowner 's authority to contract on its behalf , or that borkan had later ratified the contract . on the first point , clarke lj agreed with the judge that it was not necessary for the form to state expressly that nioc was acting as agent ; it was enough that the contract make that clear . in this case , the appropriate degree of authority " was clearly implicit in the provision ( clause.7 ) that the owners of the non - nioc tugs were to have the � benefit ' of and to be � bound ' by the conditions " . he held that the judge was correct to conclude that nioc purported to contract on behalf of borkan , noting that the form had been signed on behalf of monsoon , as it had been on at least twenty occasions since 1994 . the judge 's approach was , he held , consistent with the subsequent development of lord reid 's midland silicones criteria by the judicial committee of the privy council in the � makhutai ' [ 1996 ] ac 650 ( per lord goff at p 661 sq ) . in reaching his conclusion , clarke lj felt it legitimate , in construing the terms of the form and deciding whether nioc purported to be acting on behalf of borkan , " to have regard to the intention to benefit ( and bind ) borkan , to the fact that in the absence of such agency that intention would be thwarted and to the commercial good sense in so holding as recognised by the privy council in the cases since midlands silicones . " actual authority in finding that nioc had the authority of borkan to contract on its behalf , the admiralty judge had relied on the course of dealing between the parties and his conclusion that it was " inconceivable that the general manager of borkan at kharg island � was not aware of the terms of the form . " as regards the course of dealing , david steel j had found that borkan had no opportunity to deal directly with individual tanker owners as nioc was in operational control of the terminal ; that borkan tugs were chartered to nitc which supplied them to nioc , which then obtained the master 's signature ; that the requisition 's terms as to liability and indemnity were standard in the industry ( being based on an earlier edition of the uk standard towage conditions ) ; that this process had been frequently followed over a period of four years ; and according to a deposition by the terminal 's head of marine services , " nioc considers the terms of the [ requisition ] document apply both to nioc and all tugs involved in tug operations in an equal manner . " clarke lj found that these factors , taken together , supported the conclusion that nioc had the necessary implied authority to contract on behalf of borkan , and concluded that it was " more probable than not " that borkan 's general manager on kharg island had the relevant knowledge of the terms . he therefore held that david steel j 's conclusions were justified . the answer to question 1 was " yes " , and the appeal should be dismissed . ratification while it was now unnecessary to decide this point , clarke lj upheld the judge 's conclusion that borkan had validly ratified the contract after the casualty , for the factual reasons he gave in his judgment . unseaworthiness of the tug it was accepted that the cl . 2(b ) provision that " the hirer shall pay for and indemnify the company " against specified losses , would have no effect in the event of causative unseaworthiness due to want of due diligence , under cl.4(a ) . monsoon argued that the cl.4(a ) provisions also applied to the liability exemption in the first part of cl.2(b ) . clarke lj adopted the judge 's construction of cl.4(a ) , namely that the two elements in cl.2(b ) ( exemption and indemnity ) must be read together , to " give sensible meaning to the contract as a whole ... if loss or damage to ship or tug or the personnel of either , is caused simply by the events set out in clause 2(b ) , the tugowners are protected unless caused by � want of reasonable care ' " on their part to make the vessel seaworthy . furthermore , any ambiguity in the clause should be construed against borkan , since it was borkan that was seeking to rely on it . accordingly , he held that the cross - appeal should be dismissed . these case notes have been prepared with care , but neither the editor nor the international and other contributors can guarantee that they are free from error , nor that they contain every pertinent point . reliance should not therefore be placed upon them without independent verification . the editor and the international and other contributors disclaim all liability for any loss of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising as a result of others acting or refraining from acting in reliance on the contents of this website and the information to which it gives access . the editor claims copyright in the content of the website ._. _ _ manchester city council will do its best to meet the duties placed upon it under the act and is fully committed to implementing the actions set out in this race equality scheme . but we do recognise that , from time to time , we will not get things right or that people may be dissatisfied with the way we are carrying out our duties . we therefore intend to make sure that people know that they have a right to complain and are given information about how to do this . the act does not give individuals a right to take legal action against the council for failing to fulfil its general duty ( to tackle racial discrimination ;

" this is going to stir things up , " a third year student remarked . " ya think ! " grinned the post - grad . sitting beside him . " oh yeah . professor spelman was spitting tacks in our quantum field theory lecture yesterday . " " probably shit - scared catherwood 's right , " the post - grad commented . in response to a questioning look , he added , " if he can prove his theories , it means spelman 's spent the last twenty years working his way up a blind alley . " " ouch . " the president of the physics society appeared on the platform just then , and introduced the guest speaker . the face of one elderly man on the front row took on a deep scowl until doctor catherwood stumbled on the steps to the platform and nearly fell . " the boy always was a klutz , " professor spelman muttered with malicious pleasure to his colleague as the redheaded young man approached the podium . " this'll just be a flash in the pan . like cold fusion , " he said with a derisive laugh , but the colleague was n't fooled by his apparent confidence . doctor catherwood embarked on a whirlwind exposition of superstrings , spin foams , wilson loops and super gravity in anti - de sitter space that held the audience spellbound . " jeez , this is well beyond anything spelman 's done , " the post - grad said , struggling to keep up . as page after page of viewgraphs was filled with complex equations , spelman thought he saw an opening - a flaw in the doctor 's reasoning - and waited , like a lurking tiger , to pounce when the floor was thrown open for questions . when the time came , he rose portentously to his feet . " may i congratulate my young colleague on his masterly presentation ? " he said with a condescending smile . " however , in equation number forty - nine , if m is approximately equal to m planck , surely it would be virtually impossible to obtain gauge coupling unification ? " " ah , the old perturbative heterotic string case ? " doctor catherwood replied . " i 'm afraid my learned friend has gotten hung up on the notion that there are only ten dimensions . factor in the eleventh dimension and it all works just fine . " " really ? well , even supposing this were so , there are no practical applications for this research , " spelman snapped , resorting to defensive aggression . " mm , i thought someone would make that point , " catherwood said , with a look of smug satisfaction which had the audience sniggering , " and it is incorrect . " he held up a small silvery device like a compact remote control . " this little invention of mine can detect places in time and space where ripples in membranes collide . it can then open a hole through the dimensional wall into ' allokosmoi ' - other universes , for those unfamiliar with greek . " there were gasps of astonishment . that someone could have taken this research so far and so fast was almost beyond belief . " prove it ! " spelman scoffed . doctor catherwood 's smile widened . he had a rather feral smile , some noticed . in accordance with his plan , he stepped back from the podium and fingered the device . there was the faintest hum and , after a slight pause , a ring of pale blue light appeared in front of him . from the audience 's edgeways perspective , it stretched into a glowing , rippling vertical line taller than he was . he stepped towards it like a stage magician , caught his foot in a loop of cable and tripped . he rolled with the fall and landed on his back on � grass ? he lay , winded , in the knee - deep pasture for a few moments , looking up at the cloudless blue sky above him , and thanking his stars for his teenage martial arts training ; he had n't broken anything . he sat up and looked around . the fermi institute had gone . hell , chicago had gone . there were just the grass , the sky , a herd of something buffalo - like in the distance and , a little way off , a sizeable body of water that might - or might not - be lake michigan . " shit ! " he groaned . " this was n't supposed to happen . " on the plus side , there was no sign of immediate danger , and he had n't landed on a buffalo chip either . he 'd tested the r.c.d. , or ripple collision detector , several times before his lecture by poking his head through an opening into an allokosmos . mostly there had been no problem , though twice he 'd had to dodge back and close the ' door ' pretty sharply . on one occasion , the door had opened on something like a railway track with the local species of locomotive hurtling towards him . the other time , he 'd broken through into the middle of a war zone . not a pretty sight . he now appreciated that he really should n't have given in to the vainglory of putting one over on spelman , tempting as it had been , before he 'd worked out a means of reconnecting with his own universe . he could just hear his practical mom 's oft - made comment : " you do n't often find high intelligence and common sense in one brain , russell . like icarus , high flyers so often overlook the obvious from their lofty heights . just make sure you do n't ! " it was galling to realize he had . " come on , russell , pull yourself together , " he said to himself . " hindsight wo n't help you now . no physical danger so food 's going to be the next priority . " he regarded the distant buffalo . he was n't a chippewa ... " no point in staying here . " the first couple of universes the r.c.d. found were unsuitable . the third looked promising . he stepped through into farmyard that looked like something from the set of a twentieth century western . it seemed a likely source of food . he doubted the farm 's owner took plastic but he could work for his bread . as he looked around , the owner himself came out of a barn with a long - barrelled weapon pointing at him . he sighed and raised his hands . " whut are you ? " the elderly homesteader demanded of the sudden apparition . " er � my name 's russell catherwood , and i 'm hungry . " " huh ? " " um , could you put that gun down please ? i 'm - er -i'm not armed . " " sadie ! " the homesteader called . " a woman came out of the farmhouse . the pair reminded him of the grant wood painting , ' american gothic ' . " keep ' m covered while i check fer guns . if ' e blinks , shoot ' m. " russell obligingly held open his jacket and was relieved that the old coot merely patted him down and did n't search his pockets . apparently satisfied , he looked the young man in the eye . " now , i say agin , whut are ya , and where 'd you come from ? " " i 'm a doctor . i 've just come from chicago . " " never heard of it . " " well ... no reason why you should , i guess . it 's - um - a fair way from here , and quite a small town really , " russell said , trying to sound plausible . " so how 'd ya git here ? " " i ... walked . " " then how come there 's no dust on yer fancy shoes ? " " er , look , if you could just give me something to eat , i 'll be on my way and trouble you no more . i promise , " russell said earnestly . the homesteader grunted . " yer not wunted by the law , are ya ? " " oh no . i 'm a law - abiding citizen , " russell assured him and smiled . " ... yes , surree ! " " very well then . do n't want nobody sayin ' we ai n't hospitamable . " he said , mindful of the biblical quotation about ' entertaining angels unawares ' . " sadie'll fetch you somethin' to the barn , then you git the hell outta here and do n't come back . " sadie 's stew was tasty and filling , though eating it with a rifle pointing at him did n't add to the experience . when he 'd finished , he laid the platter on a straw bale and thanked the homesteader . " i 'll be going now , and thank you kindly for your � assistance . i 'm sorry i have no money to pay you . " he had , but thought his dollar bills might complicate things . " jest hit the road , " the man said tersely , gesturing with his rifle . he set off in the suggested direction pondering what he might do . suppose he went to the nearest town ? there might be work for him there and no questions asked , but the way of life in a frontier town really did n't appeal . behind a small thicket of unfamiliar trees , out of sight of the homesteader , he pulled the r.c.d. from his pocket . he activated the device , poked his head through the opening and found himself eyeball - to - large - reptilian - eyeball with something horrifyingly like a tyrannosaurus rex . he closed the portal immediately but not before the miasma of its breath enveloped him . he sat down sharply , the image of immense teeth and rotting flesh burned into his brain . russell 's next attempt looked promising so he stepped through into a large dark building reminiscent of the backstage area of the auditorium . he moved towards a lighter area as a voice cried , " next ! " someone put a piece of paper into his hand and shoved him into the light . " jesus , ya did n't need to wear a wig ! " yelled the voice . " ex cuse me ? " russell said with hauteur . " yeah , not bad . like the characterization , " called a second voice from beyond the lights . " okay , take it from the top � ' professor challenger ' . " " actually , it 's ' doctor ' - doctor catherwood . " " whatever ... " russell looked at the sheet of paper in his hand , shrugged , then read aloud : " ' i am calling for volunteers ! volunteers to face death - or worse - for the sake of � ' science ? " russell 's eye scanned down the page . " ' ... to go back into the tractless wastes with me ... ? ' " he peered belligerently through the lights . " i 'm sorry , but what idiot would want enthusiastic amateurs on a dangerous mission ? " " i like the attitude , but just stick to the script would you ? " said the second voice . russell felt he was on home ground here and began to argue the toss about it . " okay , do n't call us ; we 'll call you . next ! " an attractive young woman stuck her head through the drapes . " er , there are n't any more , mr. tarquentino . " " right , we 'll call it a day . you can go maxine . " russell followed her . " maxine ? i wonder if you could help me . " " you can ask , but i 'm not promising anything . " " ah , this may seem like a silly question but - where are we ? " " pinewood studios , wisconsin , " she replied , giving him a funny look . " and what 's the date ? " " june 10th 2005 . " the funny look intensified as russell 's face took on a manically hopeful smile . " you 're not a serial killer , are you ? " russell laughed . " no i 'm not , though i would say that either way . " she seemed slightly reassured so he went on . " actually i 'm a scientist , and i 'm trying to get to either princeton or the university of chicago . " " lost your way a little , have n't you ? but chicago 's just over the state line - not more'n an hour away . " " thanks . " this probably was n't his universe but it was close enough . the big problem - was there another doctor catherwood here , along with the danger of death through entropic cascade failure ? he reached inside his shirt for the gizmo hanging around his neck . this was one safety feature he had thought of - a pea - brane generator with a metal - organic framework crystal at its heart . it should function forever , near enough . he switched it on , encasing himself in his own private universe , its outer membrane hugging his skin without actually touching it . chicago university looked much like the one he 'd just left . he went into the reception where the man at the desk looked at him in surprise . " doctor catherwood , i presume ? " he learned shortly afterwards that his alter ego was just as clumsy . this doctor catherwood had mysteriously disappeared a year previously too . their two universes were clearly very closely parallel . feeling a tad guilty , russell returned to ' his ' post at princeton . things were slightly different here but he was able to blend in just fine . no one realized he was a different doctor catherwood . he continued his work on allokosmoi which , years later , won him a nogong prize . he often wondered , wistfully , where the other him was ... meanwhile , in another galaxy not so far away , lindenwood 's hottest new star was attending the premier of his second film . above the theater entrance , the lights read , " russell catherwood in ' return to the lost world ' " ._. _ _ at the end of november , the royal college of physicians and surgeons in glasgow played host to a joint bgs / jchmt meeting on the future of training in geriatric medicine . a cross section of consultant and trainee geriatricians attended the event , which was designed to shed light on how training might evolve under the impact of modernising medical careers ( mmc ) and run - through training . dr nicki colledge outlined current spr training and curriculum , noting that the jchmt generic skills curriculum maps closely to the gmc standards for good practice . the tension between training in general internal medicine and geriatric medicine was widely acknowledged to be a source of concern . professor ken cochrane outlined the proposed structure for modernising medical careers . though not yet finalised , run through grades will be introduced from 2007 . during the f2 year , individuals will apply for a generic ' basic medical training ' post . during this two - year period , they will be selected for higher specialist training as part of the run - through scheme . this may surmount the problem of having to select a specialty during f2 . mrcp part 1 will be taken during basic medical training , and paces will be passed by the end of the first year of higher specialist training . it is less clear what will happen to people who can not or do not want to go into run - through training . time limited posts ( 1 - 2 years ) will be available with a limited training component , with the option to then apply for run - through training or staff - grade / associate specialist type posts . dr ian starke , chair of the internal medicine specialist advisory committee ( sac ) , discussed the rise of the acute physician . even with a planned 150 new spr posts per year , it will take 20 years to reach the desired level of three acute physicians in every acute trust . this means that geriatricians will be involved in the acute medical take for many years to come ! dr sally briggs presented the latest update on career decision choices in geriatrics . the major influences on choosing geriatrics were role models and positive clinical experiences . most people make the choice to do geriatrics relatively late in their training . seventy per cent of sprs said that geriatrics was their first career choice ; however , 10 per cent of sprs and 10 per cent of consultants regretted their choice of career . this may produce negative feedback to some people considering a career in geriatrics . prof john gladman outlined the four possible uses for academic training sessions : research , teaching , msc and quality assurance . although individuals do not have to use the sessions for research , a tangible output is necessary and should be assessed at the rita . prof paul baker outlined one way of spending the sessions - the highly structured spr teaching programme in the north - west deanery , complete with web - based teaching support and an optional msc programme run by the university of salford . positive feedback was received from trainees on the programme , and the study leave budget is now underspent , as trainees feel that many topics are well covered locally . professors steve allen and tash masud reviewed the new methods of spr assessment . 360 degree appraisal is now with us , and even trainees now in 3rd/4th year should probably do one round before pya . data presented show trainees find the exercise more useful if the supervisor , rather than the trainee , distributes the forms . knowledge based assessment will be trialled nationwide on 18th may 2006 . if all goes well , the exam will be introduced in 2007 , and will be sat in the first two years of higher specialist training . multiple attempts will be allowed , with two sittings per year , and the exam is designed to establish a minimum level of competency ; thus the intention is to get everyone to pass it . prof tim hendra , chair of the sac in geriatrics , outlined the proposed categories of subspecialty training : stroke , continence , falls , orthogeriatrics , movement disorders , community geriatrics and psychogeriatrics . all trainees will be encouraged to train in a subspecialty , and can count one of the five years doing subspecialty training or research . those wishing to undertake a year of research plus a subspecialty , or who want to train in two subspecialties , would need to extend training by a year . it is possible that in future , subspecialty training may occur after award of the cct . dr jeremy playfer , bgs president , rounded off the meeting with poetry and some wide - ranging remarks on the need for well - rounded doctors and a good evidence base being vital to the continuing health of geriatrics . the challenge will be to implement the new training paradigm without losing sight of what is best for older people now and in the future ._. _ _ mental health prt began a major programme of work on mental health in prisons in 2000 . the mental health needs of the prison population are well - established . the problem remains that these needs are not met . the prt programme sets out to be a catalyst to the prison service / nhs partnership . entitled ' troubled inside ' prt 's mental health programme will start with a series of three conferences with linked briefing papers . each will focus on a different population - young people , women , and men in prison - and each will aim to : increase awareness of mental health needs reveal the current inadequacies of the system profile good practice set an agenda for change . prt is determined to : press for parity in health services for people in prison with those in the community campaign to ensure that people with severe mental illness are not held in prison custody prove a useful catalyst for action by the prison service and the nhs . the first conference , responding to the mental health needs of children and young people in prison was held at the rsa in london on 28 november 2000 . a report was published in september 2001 . a second conference was held in 2002 to focus on women and mental health and the third , later in the year , on men .

misusers promoting quality , efficiency and effectiveness in drug misuse treatment services in england part 2 : full reference report chapter 2 : drug misuse treatment modalities 2.7 residential rehabilitation 2.7.1 description residential rehabilitation is a tier 4 service . tier 4 services are specialist drug and alcohol services offering intensive and structured programmes delivered in controlled residential , hospital inpatient or other controlled environments . residential rehabilitation programmes aim to engender and maintain abstinence in a residential setting . it is recognised that people with complex problems related to drug misuse may require respite and an intense programme of support and care which can not realistically be delivered in a community or outpatient setting . 2.7.1.1 context the broad array of drug and alcohol residential rehabilitation services in the uk can be described on various levels : therapeutic orientation and milieu programme structure , intensity and duration . the degree of intensity of therapeutic support also varies quite widely across the residential services sector . residential rehabilitation services have been pioneered and sustained mainly in the voluntary sector and by independent providers on a not - for - profit basis . local authority social services departments currently initiate access to residential rehabilitation programmes . treatment is paid for by community care funding and supplemented by other funding . there are over 100 programmes operating in england ( drugscope 2002 ) . residential treatment should be seen as a national resource with out - of - area referrals characterising substantial numbers of client episodes . residential services are usually registered under the registered care homes act ( 1984 ) , now the care standards act 2000 , as registered nursing or care homes with or without nursing . they must comply with appropriate registration controls imposed by the local authority and by the new care standards commission ( see standards below ) . a few residential services are registered as independent hospitals . 2.7.1.2 philosophy and approach the treatment philosophy , structure and intensity of residential rehabilitation services vary quite widely in the uk . there are three broad types of rehabilitation provision : therapeutic communities 12-step programmes based on the minnesota model of addiction recovery treatment faith - based or general houses promoting a less structured programme which favours a more individually tailored package of care for each client different programmes are available , based on cognitive behavioural and motivational interviewing approaches . the majority of residential rehabilitation programmes require their clients to be drug free on entry , although some provide medically supervised withdrawal to facilitate abstinence ( see previous section ' inpatient substance misuse treatment ' ) . programmes usually run from the point of client detoxification , or immediately after the completion of detoxification , and last for a period of between six weeks and 12 months . the national care standards commission ( ncsc ) classify short - term as under six months . full - time residential care is often phased in intensity , so that the resident may be in a minimum supervision half - way house or in supported housing in the later stages of this care . there is a somewhat patchy network of aftercare houses in the uk . these provide a bridging rehabilitation programme for the drug user in recovery . collectively , these residential services are abstinence based and have relapse prevention as their major service outcome goal . this is accomplished by providing a safe living environment supported by staff and peers and a therapeutic programme comprising groups , lectures , individual counselling , and sometimes , family involvement . 2.7.1.3 location residential facilities can be purpose - built or refurbished free - standing facilities in rural / semi - rural locations , or converted inner- and outer - city facilities in residential houses . residential rehabilitation facilities vary in size . many services receive clients from a wide catchment area - for example , clients from urban locations may need to receive treatment away from their usual drug - oriented environment . 2.7.1.4 programme duration a number of types of programme can be identified : short - term residential rehabilitation , long - term residential rehabilitation , and third stage or low intensity " half way houses " . short - term residential rehabilitation these services usually include a medically supervised withdrawal programme ( see previous section ' inpatient substance misuse treatment ' ) as the first stage of a rehabilitation programme that has a planned duration of six to 12 weeks . the national treatment outcomes research study ( ntors ) project studied four of these services in england , with 88 clients recruited to the study . the median duration of treatment for these clients was six weeks . long - term residential rehabilitation or second stage these services generally do not provide medically supervised withdrawal services as a first treatment phase . the planned duration of the rehabilitation programme varies quite widely . the 11 long - term residential services in the ntors reported a planned duration of 12 - 52 weeks , and the 108 subjects recruited had a median time in treatment of 10 weeks . low - intensity residential rehabilitation or third stage and halfway house rehabilitation low - intensity residential rehabilitation and halfway house rehabilitation services denote forms of continuing residential care for clients who have usually completed a long - term residential therapeutic programme . third stage and halfway houses are normally residential services linked to the main programme . clients maintain their drug - free status and live in a semi - independent context preparing for fully independent living in the community . the duration of halfway house care programmes is not currently known . the goals of these services relate to promotion of stable employment , vocation training and education . low - intensity services may have a low level of staff cover and input to the clients , although a higher level of care may be available if needed . 2.7.1.5 staffing and competency most residential rehabilitation services ( particularly those offering detoxification or longer - term programmes ) will be registered as care homes or independent hospitals . as such they must comply with the standards for the category under which they are registered . the majority of residential rehabilitation services are registered under the registered care homes act ( 1984 ) , now the care standards act 2000 , as registered nursing or care homes with or without nursing . they must comply with appropriate registration controls imposed by the care standards commission . this includes demonstrating competence against national occupational standards in social care ( and/or health care ) for individual staff and managers . the standards require that all managers and staff of residential homes are appropriately trained and working towards a recognised qualification . residential programmes are usually staffed by a multidisciplinary team , which can comprise : co - ordinator / manager administrator / secretary social workers counsellors drug workers / care workers state - registered nurse / other nurses . programmes may also have sessional input from consultant psychiatrists and specialist registrar and other medical personnel from primary care and other health services . other professional groups that may be involved include clinical and counselling psychologists , family therapists , occupational therapists and other professional groups ( also see standards below ) . from 1 april 2002 all staff working in residential rehabilitation homes must have a criminal records check carried out on them before they are confirmed in post . the nta has published a toolkit to enable managers of residential rehabilitation services to meet the care standards commission human resource standards . it is available on the nta website : www.nta.nhs.uk . 2.7.2 aims and objectives 2.7.2.1 treatment aims and objectives residential rehabilitation programmes are quite diverse in the way they operate but most provide a structured programme of treatment , which shares the following basic features : maintenance of abstinence from illicit drugs , or prescription drugs that have been abused , in a controlled or semi - controlled therapeutic environment communal living with other drug users in recovery emphasis on shared responsibility by peers and group counselling relapse prevention - oriented counselling and support individual support and promotion of education , training and vocational experience improved skills for activities of daily living housing advocacy and resettlement work aftercare and support . 2.7.2.2 client group served clients of residential rehabilitation services are individuals who are seeking abstinence from their main problem drug in a controlled setting . they also include drug misusers in recovery or individuals who have achieved a state of abstinence from their main problem drug ( or all drugs ) , usually through successful detoxification . many individuals who enter rehabilitation units have quite long histories of drug misuse treatment and many have quite severe drug misuse problems at referral . opioid dependence is the most common problem encountered by staff at these services and higher rates of drug injecting and sharing of injecting equipment may also be encountered , in comparison with clients attending specialist community prescribing services . residential rehabilitation clients are also more likely to use stimulants ( amphetamine and cocaine ) , drink alcohol at risky levels and be involved in criminal behaviour ( gossop et al . 1998c ) . it is acknowledged that current service provision in england often does not adequately meet the needs of primary stimulant misusers and most particularly the needs of primary crack - cocaine misusers , although us evidence shows that residential rehabilitation can be effective for this group . it is also widely acknowledged that residential rehabilitation services are generally poor at meeting the needs of black and minority ethnic drug misusers ( sangster et al . 2002 ) . 2.7.2.3 eligibility and priority admission to residential services is voluntary , but can be part of a community sentence or post - custodial sentence from the courts . to establish eligibility , a community care assessment is carried out to ensure that the client meets admission criteria . local authorities usually perform this function and pay for these services , although the assessment function may be delegated to another agency such as a community team or a voluntary sector agency . from april 2002 , the residential allowance for residential rehabilitation has been replaced by a grant to local authorities . individuals accessing residential rehabilitation must have drug - related problems and meet international classification for diseases ( icd ) 10/diagnostic and statistical manual ( dsm ) iv dependence criteria . eligibility criteria and priority groups are determined at local levels and vary according to the criteria identified by the various social services departments . the target group includes : individuals who fail to achieve and maintain abstinence in a community setting those who express a desire to maintain abstinence and express a preference for admission to rehabilitation programmes or agree to enter this type of programme those who are likely to have substantial problems maintaining abstinence due to the severity of their substance dependence those requiring a programme of support and rehabilitation that is most suitably delivered in a residential environment those who are living in an environment characterised by social deprivation , including housing problems or instability , which represents a threat to relapse those who lack social support those whose social environment contains people ( e.g. partners , friends ) who are substance misusers and who are likely to hinder resolve or ability to maintain abstinence . most units are adult units , that is , patients must be over the age of 18 years . young people must be referred to child - centred programmes ( for more information on young people , see health advisory service 2001b and the section on young people in chapter 3 ) . 2.7.2.4 exclusions / contraindications these include : serious acute psychiatric morbidity , e.g. acute psychosis , requiring acute psychiatric treatment serious physical morbidity admissions may be specially timed , for example , where a couple both require inpatient treatment their admissions may be consecutive to avoid compromising care . 2.7.3 research evidence base the literature on the effectiveness of residential rehabilitation programmes remains sparse , albeit growing . only a small number of randomised controlled trials have been conducted ( see mccusker et al . 1995 ; 1996 ; 1997 ; nemes et al . 1999 ) . a relatively small number of studies have evaluated the impact of hospital inpatient units and residential rehabilitation programmes . one early english follow - up study of clients who were treated by a specialist inpatient unit found that 51 % of patients were drug free at a six - month follow - up ( gossop et al . 1989 ) . the only controlled study of inpatient and outpatient treatment of opiate withdrawal in the uk found inpatient withdrawal to be four times more effective for the proportion of patients who completed the withdrawal regime ( gossop et al . 1986 ) . the national treatment outcome research study ( ntors ) showed that clients entering residential rehabilitation and inpatient programmes made substantial improvements in terms of abstinence from , and reduction of , illicit drug misuse , criminal activity , levels of injecting and psychological health . the study also showed that clients who stayed in treatment for a critical time ( more than three months ) showed better outcomes than those who left the programme at an earlier stage . it also showed that severely dependent and problematic misusers could achieve positive outcomes as a result of residential rehabilitation programmes ( gossop et al . 1999b and 2001a ) . us studies have shown that outcome from longer - term residential rehabilitation programmes is related to total time spent in treatment , with episodes of at least three months associated with positive outcome ( simpson 1997 ) . the american drug abuse treatment outcome studies ( datos ) provided important information , especially in relation to primary crack misusers . the studies found that long - term residential programmes that retain clients for at least three months are particularly cost beneficial for highly criminal clients with severe problems . in contrast , shorter - term and less - intensive treatments appear to be adequate for most of the less problematic users , even those who have left relatively early ( simpson et al . 1999 ) . the majority of us studies have evaluated therapeutic community ( tc ) programmes . programme length varies from short term with aftercare to long - term programmes of more than one year 's duration . us data point to the considerable success of these services for the recovering misuser . studies show that , on average , clients receiving tc treatment have enduring post - discharge reductions in illicit drug use ( deleon et al . 1979 ; gossop et al . 1999b ; simpson and lloyd 1979 ) . us and uk studies have shown positive psychosocial benefits after treatment ( georgakis 1995 ; deleon and jainchill 1982 ; bennett and rigby 1990 ) . 2.7.4 access and referral pathways admission to residential services is voluntary , but is dependent on an assessment for eligibility . generally , local authority social services departments carry out assessments for eligibility . in a few cases , local specialist drug services have been contracted by social services departments to carry out community care assessments . if eligibility for residential care is supported and funded , the client is referred directly to a suitable programme either within the local authority or dat boundary or to a provider in another area . care management is undertaken by the social services departments or contracted agencies . the most common referral pathway involves an initial determination of need for residential rehabilitation by generic or specialist substance misuse services or criminal justice agencies that refer clients to social services departments or other organisations contracted by them to carry out a full assessment of eligibility . referral is also sometimes undertaken by tier 1 services . it is also possible for clients to be assessed for community care funding by directly contacting their local social services department . there should be clearly described written information about how the referral process is undertaken . this material should cover : how referrals are made / eligibility criteria the minimum and maximum timescales for response which staff are involved and how the referral will be managed how the referral process will be documented and referral outcomes monitored and communicated . 2.7.4.1 integrated care pathways see diagram detailing care pathway for residential care . 2.7.5 assessment dimensions clients who are considered for residential rehabilitation will be assessed on the following six problem areas : acute intoxication and/or withdrawal potential biomedical conditions and complications emotional / behavioural conditions and complications ( e.g. psychiatric conditions , psychological or emotional / behavioural complications of known or unknown origin , poor impulse control , changes in mental status , or transient neuropsychiatric complications ) treatment acceptance / resistance relapse / continued use potential recovery / living environment . the client is evaluated on the six problem areas above , together with other individual psychological , medical and social factors . at referral , clients may have several biomedical complaints , including : depressed mood nervousness / anxiety insomnia physical complications related to drug use accidents and injuries related to drug use . for more details on assessment see chapter 1 . 2.7.6 management 2.7.6.1 treatment phases many residential rehabilitation services organise the delivery of their therapeutic programmes in stages that mark milestones of a client 's progress through the organisational programme . the concept of stages is closely , but not exclusively , grounded in the philosophy and practice of therapeutic communities ( deleon 2000 ) . generally speaking , the treatment stages are : assessment detoxification : physical withdrawal / psychological monitoring and treatment ( where provided ) ongoing reduction of vulnerability , relapse prevention and health promotion ( which includes assistance with housing , career counselling , welfare and financial counselling , etc ) . 2.7.6.2 care planning , co - ordination and review the processes of care planning , co - ordination and review are described in detail in chapter 1 . individuals who are eligible for community care support are allocated a care manager from social services or the organisation contracted by social services . 2.7.6.3 departure planning departure from the programme and onward referral should be a planned element of the programme . this should normally be overseen by the keyworker , although some providers may have dedicated workers who facilitate onward referral and aftercare support . the importance of housing in the rehabilitation and integration of substance misusers who have achieved abstinence can not be stressed enough . supporting people is the new policy framework for supported housing ; it provides new opportunities for dats and commissioners to establish ( or review ) policies in relation to drugs and homeless drug users . the importance of housing to the rehabilitation and re - integration of substance misusers is discussed in tackling drugs in rented housing : a good practice guide ( home office and department for transport , local government and the regions 2002 ) . chapter 4 in particular is relevant and discusses how housing can be used to assist drug users overcome their dependence . 2.7.6.4 aftercare and continued support aftercare following departure from the programme and onward referral should be a planned element of the programme . aftercare can maximise the benefits of residential rehabilitation programmes and reduce the risk of relapse and drug - related harm . service providers ( in partnership with community care managers if appropriate ) should be planning aftercare from the outset of a treatment episode - particularly if the service user has housing needs . in the final phase of the residential treatment episode , intensive work should be undertaken by the provider to prepare the individual for departure and return to the community . this should include liaison and referral to supportive services to sustain and reinforce the rehabilitation programme . patients may be at particular risk of drug - related death due to overdose if they leave residential rehabilitation and return to previous levels of drug and alcohol misuse . all residential rehabilitation services should educate and work with service users to reduce the risk of harm due to drug - related death - particularly those who are discharged or leave programmes prior to completion . 2.7.7 standards as previously stated , residential rehabilitation services may register as care homes or independent hospitals . they must comply with the standards for the category under which they are registered . the majority of residential rehabilitation services are registered under the registered care homes act ( 1984 ) , now the care standards act 2000 , as registered nursing or care homes with or without nursing . they must comply with appropriate registration controls imposed by the care standards commission . some concessions have been made to elements of the standards to accommodate the special needs of drug treatment services . any areas of non - compliance must be transparent and have an identified need within the risk assessment . clients must be informed of these variations . the exemption to the standard can be allowed if they can be justified appropriately by the therapeutic needs of the programme . any exemption to the standard must be specified in the initial contract ( for example , restrictions on visitors ) . residential rehabilitation programmes must also comply with health and safety legislation , environmental health and fire regulations . other relevant standards are : the national minimum standards for residential homes for younger adults and adult placements core standards on the management of residential rehabilitation can be found in quads : organisational standards for alcohol and drug treatment services ( alcohol concern and standing conference on drug abuse 1999 ) standards on the commissioning of residential rehabilitation are available in commissioning standards for drug and alcohol treatment and care ( substance misuse advisory service 1999 ) relevant competencies are outlined in the drugs and alcohol national occupational standards ( danos ) ( skills for health 2002 ) . 2.7.8 performance indicators for detailed information about monitoring residential rehabilitation , see ' performance and outcome monitoring ' in chapter 4 ._. _ _ kwintessential - the smart choice for english language lessons ... we offer a range of quality , personalised and professionally delivered english language lessons .

( 2003 ) strikingly low circulating crp concentrations in ultramarathon runners independent of markers of adiposity - how low can you go ? arteriosclerosis thrombosis and vascular biology 23 ( 9 ): pp . 1640 - 1644 . full text of this document is not available in this eprints service . abstract objective - this study was undertaken to evaluate to what extent c - reactive protein ( crp ) can be reduced by exercise by examining its circulating concentrations in male ultramarathon runners and to determine if low leptin as a robust circulating marker of fat mass could account for low crp in such men . methods and results - sixty - seven male ultramarathon runners and 63 sedentary male controls of similar age and body mass index were recruited . crp and leptin were measured by elisa and radioimmunoassay , respectively . median crp concentration in lean ( body mass index lt 25 kg / m(2 ) ) marathon runners was less than half control median ( 0.4 [ 0.2 to 0.9 ] mg / l versus 0.9 [ 0.5 to 2.7 ] mg / l , p=0.0013 ) and , more strikingly , in nonlean runners was approximately 26 % of control median ( 0.4 [ 0.3 to 0.8 ] mg / l versus 1.5 [ 0.9 to 2.5 ] mg / l , p=0.0002 ) . circulating leptin levels were also substantially lower in lean ( 45 % less ) and nonlean ( 63 % less , both p=0.0001 ) ultramarathon runners . however , interleukin-6 levels were not different . furthermore , leptin adjustment only minimally attenuated the case - control difference in crp , suggesting that mechanisms other than fat mass reduction contribute to low concentrations of crp in marathon runners . conclusions - this study suggests that circulating crp concentrations can be markedly suppressed , independently of total adiposity or indeed fat mass , by intense regular physical exercise ._. _ _ bfi publishing produces series of books on film and tv for both specialist and non - specialist readers . full listings of each title , more information and purchase links are available online . dvd & video catalogue you can buy online many of the best films ever made from around the world , on dvd and video . you can also see details of the latest releases and some of the most popular themed series , and browse or search through the entire catalogue ._. _ _ apply for a job at hampshire county council join the library , reserve items and check your borrower information . advertise your event in our " what 's on " service services for charities , non - profit groups and clubs web space hosting - hampshire public service and community organisations can apply for free web hosting . register with e . volve our directory of community groups . register to buy products through county supplies , our central purchasing service . request information make a freedom of information request make a data protection subject access request school governors - book training buy and pay hantsweb shop buy road safety clothing and equipment pay a hampshire county council invoice travel information check on the roads- traffic cameras and up - to - the - minute travel information . directgov - do it online the easy way to government information and services online , from passports and tax assessments to fishing and tv licences . how have we done ?

cambridge , 1991 ; esau 's tears : modern anti - semitism and the rise of the jews , cambridge university press ; cambridge , 1997 ) has put forward an eminently defensible proposition � that there were objective aspects of judaism , as well as jewish activities and culture , which gave rise to manifestations of the phenomenon known as antisemitism . it has been lindemann � s folly to elevate this idea to the status of an id � e fixe , almost as powerful as the concept of ' eternal antisemitism ' which he energetically ( and correctly ) rejects . lindemann 's primary claim is that the ' rise of the jews ' in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries helps to explain ( although not justify ) the development of modern antisemitism . he has been unable , unfortunately , to resist the temptation to read this hypothesis back into the whole history of jewish / non - jewish relations . his scholarly leitmotif , which gives the title to his most recent study of antisemitism , is the biblical story of isaac ( who becomes israel , the prototype jew ) and his brother esau , who represents the gentile nations . the cause of their dispute is isaac 's theft of esau 's birthright from their father jacob . for lindemann this tale , which he admits was strange and problematical even for the rabbis , provides the general framework for his study of antisemitism through the ages . lindemann has done little original research in the sources of antisemitism , and so his major books have been works of synthesis , with generalisations based on a reading of the secondary literature . in areas where existing literature is thin , this often has unfortunate consequences . his treatment of antisemitism in tsarist russia ( which constitutes a major portion of the jew accused ) is replete with factual errors great and small , and dubious over - generalisations . hopefully it will not be judged as special pleading if i direct lindemann to my own imperial russia � s jewish question , 1855 - 1881 ( cambridge university press ; cambridge , 1996 ) , especially since we share a common publisher . still , an author can be wrong � and even bloody - minded � and not be malevolent or dishonest . unfortunately , a number of lindemann � s academic critics , especially robert wistrich of hebrew university , have been unwilling to concede lindemann � s scholarly integrity . in the course of an ill - tempered campaign against his work , lindemann has , perhaps inevitably , been accused of antisemitism . ( 1 ) given this situation , lindemann might be viewed as both the best and the worst possible contributor to a series that seeks to provide � new information and interpretations � : his work does represent a new interpretation , even while it has been impugned by leading scholars in the field . this particular work appears in the longman seminar series in history , intended , as already noted , for students . besides offering new information , it also provides � a selection of documents to illustrate major themes and provoke discussion � , as well as a guide to further reading . the reviewer thus faces a triple task of evaluation : how well does the author fulfil his informational task ; how effective for the stated purpose is the selection of documents ; and what is the merit of the reading list ? it must be admitted at the outset that it is an impossible task to encapsulate the entire history of antisemitism from its origins ( whatever they might be perceived to be ) up to the year 1939 in 109 pages , with 17 pages for documents , and seven pages for a 189-item bibliography . we must reconcile ourselves in advance to oversimplifications , omissions and sweeping generalisations . that said , lindemann writes the book we might have expected him to write . he juxtaposes two well - established interpretational antipodes . the phenomenon of � eternal antisemitism � locates all the basis for hatred of the jews in their � peculiar kind of separatism , itself related to their sense of superiority to others � and to � the themes of their religion , particularly those that denigrate other beliefs and customs � ( pp . 4 - 5 ) . at the other extreme is the claim that � eternal antisemitism � is � blaming the victim � , and that antisemitism is � uniquely a non - jewish problem � ( p. 5 ) . lindemann offers his own brand of compromise : � antisemitism is most usefully conceptualised as hatred / fear of jews that includes a key element of irrationality or emotionally fraught fantasy . but that fantasy is typically intertwined with elements of more accurate or concrete perceptions . � ( 2 ) having separated these strands , the task for the historian is to demonstrate and explain their inter - action . lindemann promises to do this in regard to his more general theme : � i have tried to understand the way that fantasy ( ideologies , myths and other less formal productions of the mind ) and reality ( developments in the material world ) interact � ( p. 11 ) . this is , regretfully , what lindemann often fails to do . this is particularly apparent in his discussion of the crucial period in the early christian middle ages , when the jews were effectively � demonised � , a process through which bizarre charges , such as ritual murder and desecration of the sacramental host , were attributed to them . this was also the era of the first mass violence against the jews , in the form of the crusades . despite citing the rich and suggestive work of gavin langmuir in the reading list , lindemann does little to integrate it into his text , perhaps because it largely locates the sources of violent jew - hatred in the collective mind and religious insecurities of christians , rather than some objective characteristic of the jews , such as their wealth and identification with oppressive rulers ( p. 29 ) . he simply fails to demonstrate his claim that � fantasies about jews continued to be fed by realities , in a complex and nearly impenetrable interplay � ( p. 30 ) . it is strange that , given their significance for the development of catholic and protestant attitudes towards the jews , the reformation and catholic counter - reformation receive no more than one page of text , which is , it might be noted , twice as much space as that devoted to the expulsion from spain ( pp . 30 - 31 ) . this haste to be rid of the pre - modern period is perhaps explained by lindemann � s desire to consider more familiar territory , and to reassert his claim that a major ingredient of modern antisemitism is � the rise of the jews � . ironically , while this theme bubbles in the background , the later pages of the book are largely an overview of antisemitic policies ( tsarist russia ) and ideologies ( austria - hungary and germany ) . lindemann does confront one crucial theme , however : the links between european antisemitism in the nineteenth century , and national socialism in the twentieth . he implicitly rejects the thesis of daniel goldhagen , in hitler � s willing executioners : ordinary germans and the holocaust ( little , brown ; london , 1996 ) , that the rise of � eliminationist � antisemitism in wilhelmine germany paved the way for the final solution . it would be useful to have lindemann � s disagreement with goldhagen ( whose work will certainly be encountered by students but is not included in the reading list ) more overtly spelled out . in summary , this book displays the strengths and weaknesses of lindemann � s approach to antisemitism : a comprehensible and vigorously - argued thesis that relates best to the phenomenon of modern antisemitism , combined with a surprising number of gaps and omissions that weaken that same thesis for two thousand years of jewish / non - jewish interaction in pre - modern european civilization and culture . the documents add very little to the text , in which they are cited , but hardly explicated . i was unable to find much logic in the selectionn � i wonder if students will do better . a set of four maps are appended � to help students place developments discussed in the text � . they are , alas , replete with spelling and factual errors , exemplified by the map illustrating tsarist russia : the pale of settlement is mis - identified ( it did not include the kingdom of poland ) , and the confusing lines which are meant to illustrate the territory of the pogroms between 1902 ( sic ) and 1906 are simply wrong . the reading list , with some notable omissions noted above , offers students a suitable guide to further reading . a sure candidate for inclusion in the category of � scholars behaving badly � is norman finkelstein , the academic gadfly who condemns and campaigns against what he has branded ' the holocaust industry ' . small wonder that he is less than complimentary about what he sarcastically calls yehuda bauer 's � crowning achievement of his life 's work � , rethinking the holocaust . in finkelstein 's summary , bauer manages both to affirm and deny every major thesis on the nazi extermination of the jews : it can and ca n't be rationally understood ; did and did n't spring from the enlightenment and french revolution ; was and was n't comparable to the extermination of the gypsies � he bizarrely criticizes ' most of german historiography ' on the nazi holocaust because it ' avoids the murder itself and instead agonises over who decided what and when regarding the murder of the jews ' ( 3 ) so much for bauer � s stated intention � to rethink categories and issues that arise out of the contemplation of that watershed event in human history � ( bauer , p. ix ) ! this � rethinking � is the basis for finkelstein � s condemnation � to what extent is it warranted ? in fact , bauer is generally clear and precise in his arguments . early on he defines his terms : the holocaust was an example of genocide that can be compared with other types of this phenomenon . it was � unique � in the same way that all historical events are , with special characteristics and unprecedented attributes . something like the holocaust could , bauer believes , happen again . the task of his work is therefore � political � , in that it seeks to ensure that the holocaust serves as � a warning , not a precedent � ( p. 3 ) . holocaust , therefore , is totally explicable , and bauer � s chapters represent an overview of the diverse scholarly attempts to find explanations . if there is an occasional reluctance to come down on the side of one interpretation or another � although bauer is not shy in asserting his critical assessment of fellow scholars � it is because bauer shares saul friedlander � s reluctance to admit � closure � into holocaust debates : the assumption that historians have found satisfactory answers to the myriad problems that the holocaust raises ( pp . 7 - 8 ) . this is a point worth pursuing . i would argue that one of the indicators of the health and validity of the study of the holocaust is precisely the lack of scholarly consensus . besides the negative features of the � holocaust industry � that so displease finkelstein � especially what he sees as the unseemly scramble for compensation for survivors and the subsequent direction of such funds into holocaust scholarship , education or memorialisation � one might note an extremely positive feature : the manner in which the study of the specific case of the holocaust of european jewry has helped to crystallise the more general field of genocide studies . by providing a model for comparison , and a demand for explication , the holocaust has served as a driving engine for the comparative study of other twentieth - century genocides and their origins . bauer � s emphasis on the historiography of the holocaust , his book can serve as a solid introduction for students or the general reader . bauer shows how the field developed . the first studies , exemplified by raul hilberg � s classic the destruction of the european jews ( w.h. allen ; london , 1961 ) , sought to determine exactly how the german national socialist state implemented the mass murder of european jews . this line of research was followed by explorations of how various groups , such as the jews themselves , and the various western powers , responded to the nazi genocide . only in the last decades of the twentieth century did a substantial number of scholars begin to ask the � why � questions , and to attempt to analyse and explain the holocaust as a whole . devotes two chapters to the � why � question . as bauer acknowledges early on , he himself assigns central importance to the role of an elite antisemitic ideology . he is thus critical of more instrumental interpretations , such as zygmunt bauman � s use of the concept of � modernity � . bauer � s own stress on the role of ideology makes him willing to offer a sympathetic hearing to daniel goldhagen � s reliance on the idea of a strong tradition of � eliminationist � antisemitism . this was the decisive element that turned ordinary germans into � hitler � s willing executioners � , a monocausal explanation that has been widely criticised by academic scholars . bauer praises goldhagen for re - emphasizing the role of ideology , even while � stumbling badly � in his efforts to apply it . � s selection of problems , or areas of possible investigation , reveal much about his identity as a jewish scholar , living and working in israel . his academic address is yad vashem , created originally to memorialise the victims of the nazi genocide , but lately grown into a major centre for the study of the holocaust . from this perspective , bauer is especially drawn to the problem of the � sheep to the slaughter � syndrome � the apparent passive acceptance of holocaust victims of their fate . this has always been a contentious issue , first identified and lamented in the very midst of the warsaw ghetto . bauer thus devotes two chapters to the problem of resistance . he correctly raises the question of the extent to which jewish resistance has been exaggerated and inflated in response to this implied rebuke . as his survey shows , the question of active resistance � and the actual options available to jews in nazi - occupied europe � requires further research . more contentious is the issue of unarmed or passive resistance . one of the first chroniclers of the nazi genocide , the soviet - jewish writer vasily grossman , argued that the very act of leading a normal , human life in the ghettos � creating libraries , organizing a cultural life , engaging in the provision of welfare � represented a form of � spiritual resistance � , that was often the only option open to the jews . this view has come to be incorporated into a view of resistance that goes under the hebrew term of amidah . as bauer admits , this term is elastic and imprecise . amidah , he suggests , � includes both armed and unarmed actions and excludes passive resistance , although that term is almost a non sequitur , because one can not really resist passively . when one refuses to budge in the face of brutal force , one does not resist passively ; one resists without using force , and that is not the same thing � ( p. 120 ) . one can almost hear finkelstein in the background demanding , � all right , so what doesn � t amidah cover ? ' in the course of his discussion , bauer also deals with the enduring controversy of the role of the nazi - imposed jewish councils in the ghettoes , the judenr � te . here again terminology is elusive . did the operation of the judenr � te represent cooperation or collaboration , or something else ? we have gone far beyond hannah arendt � s provocative claim , in eichmann in jerusalem : a report on the banality of evil ( faber and faber ; london , 1963 ) , that more jews would have survived without jewish participation in these bodies , but much research still remains to be done on the councils , and the concept of amidah in general . bauer � s concluding chapters deal with his own area of specialised research , the rescue of jews from genocide , while also suggesting areas for future research . he investigates the case of gisi fleischmann , one of the very few women to participate actively in rescue efforts ( in this case , of slovakian jews ) . he considers the extent to which her gender helped or hindered her efforts . this study provides bauer the opportunity to note the lack of research on women in the holocaust , and to suggest that this could be a fertile field for specialists in gender studies . bauer also provides a survey of jewish theological responses to the holocaust . a substantial literature has grown up around the topic of christian religious and philosophical responses , so this chapter may introduce readers to parallel , and often unknown , perspectives . bauer concludes his study with a brief survey of the relationship of the holocaust to the creation of the state of israel . jan t. gross � book is another roadblock on the path through the tangled thicket of polish - jewish relations in the twentieth century . the topic of the book has escalated from a skirmish into a fully - fledged engagement in the website wars that have become the special battlefield of this relationship . the book has spawned so many spin - off works that we may now even speak of the ' jedwabne industry ' . unfortunately , the noisy polemics have drowned out some of the more interesting propositions that gross advances in the book . subject of the book is straightforward and tragic : on 10 july 1941 , the catholic polish inhabitants of the town of jedwabne in lomza county , in the podlasie region of north - eastern poland , massacred almost all of their jewish neighbours . the german role in the affair is disputed ; gross demonstrates that the mass - murder occurred largely through local agents , and that the actual murders � cruel and vicious � were carried out by local inhabitants . the massacre was investigated by the polish authorities in 1949 , and 21 residents of jedwabne were tried for their role in the massacre . before that time , in the immediate aftermath of the liberation of the region by the red army , those few jedwabne residents who had assisted the few jewish survivors were driven out of town by their neighbours . gross � sources are the protocols generated by the trial , the testimony of jewish survivors , and a few additional archival documents that cast some light on the identity of the leaders of the massacre . while the book has its scholarly foundations , it is clearly meant for a general audience . it has certainly found one in poland , where a polish edition appeared in 2000 , and generated an outcry that it sought to blacken the name of poland . on the other hand , it was welcomed by many jews in the west who welcome any confirmation of their assumption that poles have always imbibed jew - hatred with their mother � s milk . the massacre was led by the mayor of jebwabne , marian karolak , with the participation of members of the town council and a cross section of the local polish population . these people can hardly be placed in the categories of � scum � , or � hooligans � who are usually blamed for any polish mistreatment of the jews under nazi rule . the leaders met in advance with the germans ( who had eleven gendarme officers actually in the town ) , and agreed on the elimination of all jebwabne � s 1,600 jews , almost two - thirds of the entire population . jews were rounded up on the town square , mocked and abused , and then murdered in a variety of ways : drowned in a pond , beaten to death , buried alive . the culminating act of the pogrom came when the surviving jews were driven into a barn , which was then burned down around them . all of this occurred virtually in the centre of town . the narrative of the jebwabne massacre is brief and gruesome . critics in poland have responded in a number of ways . some have claimed , on the basis of one piece of disputed trial testimony , that there was a large german presence in jebwabne on the day . the germans either carried out the mass - murder , or forced the poles to do so . others have sought to blame the victims , by reasserting the clich � d claim that jews had eagerly welcomed the soviet occupation of the region in 1939 , and collaborated whole - heartedly with the soviet administration . ( no proof has emerged , however , that any jebwabne jew was such a � collaborator � . ) nationalists on the political right have characterised the jebwabne affair as yet another attempt of � ungrateful jews � to smear the good name of poland before the wider world . in the main , this response was anticipated by gross , who takes the time , in this short book , to ponder jebwabne � s implications for polish - jewish relations . he calls for poles to have the moral courage to face up to the difficult events of their past , as well as the episodes of glory . but , it can be argued , what does this massacre , carried out over half a century ago , have to do with the modern citizens of jedwabne , to say nothing of poland as a whole ? gross has an answer : can we arbitrarily select from a national heritage what we like , and proclaim it as patrimony to the exclusion of everything else ? or just the opposite , if people are indeed bonded together by authentic spiritual affinity � i have in mind a kind of national pride rooted in common historical experiences of many generations � are they not somehow responsible also for the horrible deeds perpetrated by members of such an ' imagined community ' . can a young german reflecting today on the meaning of his identity as a german simply ignore twelve years ( 1933 - 1945 ) of his country � s and his ancestors � history ? ( 135 ) this is even more the case , because hiding behind the fascade of collective amnesia , gross demonstrates throughout his book , the present - day citizenry of jedwabne well - remember what happened there sixty years ago . as gross , and scholars such as joanna michlic have argued ( 4 ) , if poland is to build a modern , democratic society , and a collective identity that does not rely on xenophobia and antisemitism as binding agents , her citizens must confront events from the � dark past � such as jebwabne . the work of the three scholars discussed here , whatever their strengths and weaknesses , will hopefully demonstrate , contra finkelstein , that the area of holocaust - related scholarship is neither an � industry � nor a � scandal � . january 2003 notes : ( 1 ) robert wistrich , � blaming the jews � , commentary , february 1998 , 60 - 3 .

based mercers to put restrictions on the importation of goods . in 1463 parliament imposed an embargo on the importation of luxury items from flanders . it was caxton 's duty as governor of the english nation to ensure that these rules were obeyed . sheep being shorn near a canal . a calendar page for june from a manuscript book of hours written in bruges between 1500 and 1515 . the british library ms eg 1147 f.11v . larger image the duchy of burgundy shared with england a political interest in resisting the power of the kingdom of france , but burgundy also had trade concerns of its own . english woollen cloth was perceived as being sold too cheaply in bruges , undercutting locally woven cloth . wool as raw material was imported from england via calais , which was then an english enclave surrounded by land controlled by the duke of burgundy . this wool was felt to be sold at excessively high prices , also damaging flemish weavers . as a result , the duke imposed trade restrictions on english cloth . on 20 october 1464 edward iv appointed caxton as one of his envoys to negotiate a new trade agreement with philip , duke of burgundy . the apparently positive outcome was made meaningless by the duke 's immediate ban on the importation of english cloth into burgundy . in retaliation , caxton instructed the bruges -

a demonstration of burgundian wealth and power . margaret of york was to become one of caxton 's most important_jj _ _ the search for jez 's station in winter 98 - 99 i painted the wheels of jez , and was considering how we should go about reconditioning the bonnet . when looking over our limited collection of period photos of n types i found we had a postcard of soho fire station . this showed that the wheels should in fact have small triangles ( backed up by some pictures of jez in college in 1957 ) . and that there should be coach lining on the bonnet too . it also suggested that the bonnet should not be black ( as it is currently ) or cyanide blue ( as people had told me it should be ) but possibly should have been red . so the wheels were wrong , the bonnet was wrong , and the photos suggested that the rest of the bodywork was wrong too . the main box should have additional lining and the fire station number . the chassis rail should probably have the lfb fire engine number . the only way to know for certain would be to have a photo of jez . looking through the archives crosfield said jez had been lfb " fire engine number 8 " . this was impossible , but it was possible that it was fire station number 8 . this was kensington ( just down the road from college ) so i visited the station and the local library . there was a 1921 photo of the station with two leyland appliances . but jez would have been there when she left ( to still have the 8 at crosfield ) so i assumed that was wrong . the photo there was copied at the london metropolitan archives . i visited there and again there were quite a few photos . however none of jez , but quite a few others . they also had the lfb records but they were rather limited and referred to lfb fire engine numbers and not registration or chassis number . it became evident that this would be a rather long hunt and may require a great deal of searching . i decided all the information needed to be gathered so that we would be able to narrow down even when we did n't find details specifically of jez ( plus there are another 3 lfb n types to find the history of ) . i found a list of lfb station numbers in a 1940 book . from earlier photos the station numbers looked to have stayed very similar but a few were moved around when new stations were opened and many stations had closed when they got rid of most of the steamers . i would imagine a fair number of the stations were too small for the motor appliances , and the motor appliances could travel further . for example gt . marlboro street had its number transferred to soho and gt . marlboro street was closed . in summer 2000 we were given a photo of gt . marlboro street station . this was a very detailed photo of lp8384 ; an n - type built to the same specification as jez . i went to look at the dennis archives . there were only about 30 n types made with sankey wheels delivered to london . i have marked the lfb districts of 1940 on an atoz folding map . it has the current fire stations marked on it , but we need to find out about earlier stations and mark them on . we can then mark on where the sankey wheels n types went to see if there is any correlation . dot cotton from paddington has helped us out by supplying uswith further information on lfb stations . further things to do : photograph all the fire stations in london . we have some photos that we have no idea which station they are . we should be able to correlate the architecture ( i have managed this on a couple of stations already ) . further leads to chase up : hulton getty . a photo archive . if their 18 million photos are as easily searchable as their web site then it should be easy . there were many useful photos in the 200,000 online lfb library . the lfb have a library . it is meant to have a photo collection . it will be well worth searching if it exists . surrey history centre . has the dennis records . it would be good to finish the master table of n types so we can tie up where they all went and see if there is a pattern . london metropolitan archives . it would be good to complete the accident register as far as 1932 . new information ( may 2003 ) we attended kew bridge steam museum fire engine day ( as in most years ) , and cby 1 was had been bought along by dot cotton . cby 1 had a lamp and standpipe period with lp8389 . being items that may be removed from the fire engine they were stamped with the station number and engraved with lfb . this seemed very sensible as it was possible these items could be used out of the district and in correlation with other appliances . when thinking about this on return to the garage i considered that the sidelights had the same lcc engravings . i then remembered that there was a number on the bottom of the sidelamps , that i considered to be a model number as they matched . i then looked at the original headlamps , and they were also both stamped 28p. so it appears this is not a model number . so it seems likely that it either means station 28 pump , which seems unlikely as station 28 had a leyland pump , and stamping a station number would be silly as the appliance could move stations . so it would seem very likely that the number is actually appliance 28p. this is normal nomenclature , where p is for pump . also from the lfb accident register one can see that all the pumps fell in the range appliance number 10 - 100 . the accident register also has an accident recorded for pump 28 , on the 30/12/1920 , and records it as being based at station 66 which is clerkenwell . from here we need to find backing for this hypothesis , ideally a photo . the lfb library is believed to have many photos , so if we could find a 1920 photo of clerkenwell , with the appliances this would ( dis)prove this . we could also attempt to look at lfb appliances of a similar age to see if their lamps are stamped . if we could prove if for one of these , it would be good backing for the hypothesis . new information 2 ( 14th june 2003 ) went to the london archives today and proved that hypothesis to be a load of rubbish .... whilst some of our intrepid volunteers were entering the data for the accident register ( now master lfb knowledge spreadsheet ) the others were set with the task of looking through photographs and other archive material . when requesting the lfb committee minutes and finding they wern't quite as described ed looked at the paper listings of the archive material . there was a file of records from 1915 - 1916 for the purchase of fire engines . this turned out to be all the paperwork concerned with the purchase of 10 pumps and 17 escapes that formed the batch jez was delivered with . the front cover had the list correlating registration numbers with appliance numbers . jez was down as pump 66 , which was at station 50 ( pagenats wharf ) . so we will hopefully visit the lfb library soon and attempt to find a photo . interpolation of photographic information , dennis records and the accident register also gives the pump number of 66 for lp8389 . so we now want to fully complete the story of the situation with jez being ordered , how she looked , what equipment she carried etc . i went to the southwark local studies library and chatted with the staff . they had no pictures of pageants wharf :-( . given that this was only a sub station , it probably was n't as photogenic as a station with multiple appliances . they hold the local newspapers too , but said that photos of fires were extremely rare until journalists could get telephone calls and drive around in their own cars . this may be worth persuing when we have a full list of fires attended . so i went back to the london metropolitan archives . wee need to give 48 hours notice to look at the fire logs . and two people need to attend to handle them ._. _ _ flexible hours in barristers ' chambers case study of flexible working time for work - life balance and efficiency this case study is of a project that has encouraged workers in a highly traditional environment to think differently about their work and how it might be approached . neither staff nor management had previously believed that flexibility was possible . interestingly , although some staff felt that a flexible hours environment would not make a significant difference to their working lives , in practice most have said that it has been a positive thing and that they have taken or will be taking advantage of the additional flexibility it offers . the most junior clerk also expressed considerable satisfaction in that it gave him a sense of responsibility about his work and a motivation to get things dome at different times of day to allow him to � flex ' his work at other times of day . this also has a positive effect on service delivery . cloisters is a barristers ' chambers providing legal advice and representation primarily in employment , discrimination , personal injury , clinical negligence , public law , commercial media and sport . barristers are individual practitioners who work in groups of offices known as chambers . barristers ' chambers are unique organisationally , in that they are a collection of self - employed people with an interest in the reputation and success of their chambers , but with individual specialisms and aspirations . barristers are primarily regulated by the bar council . as the law has become more complex , barristers increasingly specialise in particular areas of work . there has been constant growth in the profession over recent years , although this has slowed and in 2000 was 2 % . indicators show a levelling out is likely . there has been a corresponding growth in the size of barristers ' chambers ; in1986 the average number was 16 , this increased to 28 in 2001 . this means that barristers are working in larger units than was historically the case , impacting on their organisation and staffing . the challenge of larger chambers has been addressed by some practices with the introduction of a practice manager � cloisters introduced such a post in 2001 . other organisational challenges include increased competitiveness with a consequential need for improved marketing and reputation management , making best use of technology , and responding to demographic and social trends which impact on staff and tenants . business issues cloisters has 40 barristers supported by 10.5 staff and the project was aimed primarily at these staff . the specific business issues originally identified for the project are : absenteeism morale compliance with employment law and best practice business improvements the staff at cloisters are a mixture of long serving and new staff . informal discussions with staff have highlighted increasing concerns about work and resources . the work - life balance project is part of an overall strategy to address these . other initiatives include a review of telephone procedures and a plan to introduce new telephone system in the autumn , and an increase in staffing by one . aims of the project cloisters ' aims for the work - life balance project were to : be a progressive and pioneering chambers enhance cloisters ' corporate reputation ensure best practice and compliance with the law in relation to people policies be an employer of choice for new recruits assist a shift in culture towards devolved responsibility and staff empowerment reduce staff absence introduce more manageable working hours improve time - keeping provide more robust telephone and reception cover improve ability to find time off for training improve staff morale . a flexible hours framework was drafted by swiftwork and then developed further to meet cloisters ' specific needs . this is the basis on which the pilot is proceeding . changes implemented cloisters ' flexible hours scheme was developed in full consultation with the staff . it is based on other similar schemes but has been tailored to meet cloisters ' business needs . following on from a principles based approach , it contains standards and ground rules developed by the team . staff must work their contractual hours over any four - week period , subject to the scheme 's arrangements for carry over of debit or credit balances . development of outline service charter � the development of a service charter or agreement has been identified as necessary to the success of the project . an outline framework was developed , based on discussions with staff and barristers and drawing on an existing clerking protocol . staff invention and operation of the scheme has been critical to its success . a rota designed by the clerking team is completed by all one week in advance . this has in - built flexibility , in that individuals may adjust their proposed times only in consultation with colleagues and provided there is adequate cover . staff are utilising the scheme in different ways to suit their business and personal circumstances . some are working flexibly throughout the week creating opportunities to extend lunch breaks , arrive or leave early etc . and others are accruing time towards � flexi days ' away from work . whilst the changes implemented have been modest in absolute terms , for a traditional profession with significant external and internal barriers , this was a big step . examples of impact discussions with staff demonstrated that an overwhelming majority of them felt that the flexible hours scheme had had a positive impact on their lives . even staff who were initially sceptical acknowledged that the scheme had been beneficial , not just to colleagues , but also for themselves . it may be that the ability to improve people 's lives by increasing their ability to control their working day had been underestimated . all staff have now joined the flexitime scheme ; participation remains optional , and some staff took part only after the scheme had been operation for a while , and colleagues were obviously gaining benefits from it . some staff had taken initiatives such as joining gyms and adjusting family childcare arrangements . for some the difference it has made is palpable , reinforced by quotes such as : � when we are busy , i can now stay beyond my normal hours to make sure that everything is completed and up - to - date , and i know that i will be credited for this extra work . previously , there was no reward for helping in this way � . � going to the gym takes longer than an hour , and the scheme allows me to take the extra time needed to go at lunchtime some days , while knowing that colleagues on the rota are providing the necessary cover at the office � � i feel so much better . the week is no longer never ending . � � i actually have time now to relax in the evenings and can get ready to go out without rushing around . � � i do n't have to run down the road anymore when i 'm ten minutes late because the tubes are bad . i just make the time up . � � i feel healthier and less stressed . � � last week , i was able to take advantage of half term by coming in earlier and leaving earlier � � it 's good to know that , in future , i 'll be able to attend some of my children 's daytime school events , such as class assemblies and sports days � . before the scheme was introduced , there was no reward for working additional hours , for example , where required because of short - staffing or the need to collect files from a court hearing which had run late . this eroded goodwill relating and was a problem identified at the outset of the project . the flexible hours scheme provides for extra time worked to be recorded and acknowledged through accrual and this had led to an increased inclination to respond to unplanned business demands � in effect a return of some goodwill . responsibility for organising a rota for cover has been devolved to the clerks ' team , as mentioned above . this change of responsibility has proved a success . late arrival of staff in the morning was a continuing source of complaint by barristers . equally , staff found the 8.30am start time inflexible , stressful ( especially when there were public transport problems ) , and unnecessary . now , barristers know that staff on flexitime are paid only for hours worked , while the rota allows for staggered start times . case study here we present a case study of the impact of flexible working in cloisters barristers ' chambers in london , uk ._. _ _ eight ways to change the world documentary photo agency panos asked its photographers to bring the millennium development goals to life . in the first of a series of developments features , we publish a selection of these remarkable pictures . we look at photos of people living in extreme poverty but see first and foremost their humanity and spirit and dediccation even in the midst of extreme deprivation . their eyes do n't call for our pity , but for our camaraderie and partnership and empathy . professor jeffrey sachs from his catalogue foreward index goal one to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger photographer zed nelson : concern worldwide project in dhaka , bangladesh . goal two to give all children a primary school education photographer chris de bode : vso project in chimbiri , ethiopia . goal three to promote gender equality and empower women photographer adam hinton : actionaid , guatemala . goal four to reduce by two thirds the mortality rate among children under five photographer tim dirven : plan international in la pe � uela , dominican republic . goal five to improve maternal health photographer ami vitale : interact worldwide project in orissa , india . goal six to combat hiv / aids , malaria and other diseases photographer pep bonet : m � decins sans frontieres project in the nchelenge district , northern zambia . goal seven to ensure environmental sustainability photographer dieter telemans : wateraid project in mali . goal eight to develop a global partnership " it 's not kings and generals who make history , but the masses of the people "_'' _ _ d -

sleeved clothing and long trousers . most insects can bite through thin clothing , so spray an insecticide or repellent on them . an insect repellent should also be used on any exposed skin . spraying insecticides in the room , burning pyrethroid coils and heating insecticide impregnated tablets all help to control mosquitoes . if sleeping in an unscreened room , or out of doors , a mosquito net ( impregnated with insecticide ) is a sensible precaution . portable , lightweight nets are available . things like garlic , vitamin b and ultrasound devices do not prevent bites . filariasis filariasis is a worm infestation confined mainly to the tropics and spread from person to person by the bites of mosquitoes . many types of mosquito are involved in transmission . the severity of the disease depends on the number of worms present . filariasis affects an estimated 120 million persons in tropical areas of the world , including sub - saharan africa , egypt , southern asia , the western pacific islands , the northeastern coasts of south and central america , and the caribbean islands . the disease is caused by long thread like worms up to 50 cm in length which live under the skin and in lymphatic tissues . the female worms release larvae that circulate in the peripheral blood vessels and are ingested by mosquitoes ; thus , infected mosquitoes transmit the infection from person to person . filarial worms can live up to twenty years in humans producing larvae that infect insects but the worms do not multiply in the body . short - term travelers to endemic areas are at low risk of contracting filariasis . however , travelers who visit endemic areas for extended periods of time and who are intensively exposed to infected mosquitoes can become infected . no vaccine is available . protective measures include avoidance of mosquito bites through the use of personal protection measures symptoms vary widely between individuals but severe cases include inflammatory swelling of the arms and legs . some forms of the disease can cause blindness . in all cases , drug treatment is effective if given before the disease becomes advanced . lyme disease an infectious disease caused by a bacterium which is spread to humans by tick bites . it is characterised initially by an expanding red rash at the site of the bite often accompanied by headache , muscle and joint aches and fever . lyme disease occurs in temperate forested regions of europe ( including the uk ) and asia and in the northeastern , north central , and pacific coastal regions of north america , australia , china and japan . it is not transmitted in the tropics . travelers to endemic areas who have frequent or prolonged exposure to tick habitats could be at increased risk for lyme disease and should be advised to avoid tick habitats if possible . if exposure to tick habitats can not be avoided , the application of repellents to skin and clothing , as well as regular daily checks for any attached ticks , can reduce the risk of infection . prompt removal of any attached ticks will help prevent infection . repellents containing deet have been found to be useful but if an embedded tick is discovered , slowly pulling it out with tweezers is the best method of removal and the affected person should remain alert to the development of any symptoms . if a rash appears at the site of attachment , immediate medical attention should be sought . lyme disease is effectively treated with oral penicillin or tetracyclines . a safe and efficacious vaccine was , until recently ( feb 2002 ) , available for protection from lyme disease . however , production of the vaccine was discontinued by the manufacturer because of low demand and is no longer commercially available . leishmaniasis is caused by single celled organisms called leishmania which are passed on to humans by the bite of the sand fly ( phlebotomus ) . there are two forms of the disease : cutaneous leishmaniasis ( oriental sore ) and visceral leishmaniasis ( kala azar ) . cutaneous : the infection is restricted to the skin at the site of the bite where it manifests as skin nodules on the face , arms and legs which may form ulcers . the disease is normally self limiting but can leave the victim with disfiguring scars . the disease is found throughout north africa , the middle east , asiatic russia , iran and tourist resorts around the mediterranean . visceral : in this instance the parasites invade the liver , spleen and bone marrow causing serious illness , which , if untreated can lead to death . the main problem being failure in diagnosis . it is sometimes misdiagnosed as leukaemia or lymphoma due to enlargement of the spleen , anaemia and weight loss . it occurs in the same regions as the cutaneous form but is more widespread in parts of africa , india and south america . children are especially at risk . most cases of leishmaniasis respond well to treatment with an antimony drug ( sodium stibogluconate ) if diagnosed early enough . sleeping sickness also known as african trypanosomiasis is caused by tiny organisms called trypanosomes which are spread by the bites of infected tsetse flies and is confined to areas of tropical africa . tsetse flies breed alongside rivers and transmit the disease between wild animals , cattle and humans . it is also responsible for deaths amongst livestock and is therefore of economic significance . epidemics usually occur after outbreaks of social or political turmoil . the first sign of the illness is a boil - like swelling which arises five or more days at the site of the bite ( any sooner is probably an allergic reaction ) . fever follows within two or three weeks and a serious illness follows which unless treated , affects the nervous system resulting in the characteristic daytime drowsiness . due to the unfamiliarity of the disease it can remain undiagnosed for some time . travellers who become unwell after returning home from an endemic area must inform their doctor of their itinerary . people on wildlife safaris are most at risk . the flies are less attracted to persons on foot than on horseback and then they are more likely to attack the horse than the rider . they will even follow vehicles travelling slowly through infested areas so windows should be kept closed and any insects that enter should be killed with a knock down insecticide spray . there is no vaccine available and prophylactic drugs are not recommended since they mask symptoms . prevention depends largely on avoidance of bites . effective drug treatment is hazardous and highly specialised . chagas disease also known as american trypanosomiasis , chagas is a potentially serious disease also caused by trypanosomes which is endemic to south and central america which is spread by biting bugs called assassin bugs or kissing bugs . the disease is present in most rural areas particularly where there is a human presence . this is because the bugs that spread the disease live in the walls of mud huts where they venture out , only at night to feed . travellers to these areas are most at risk but avoidance is straightforward . true jungle areas of the amazon are mainly free of the disease and visitors to cities or remote jungle ruins are not at risk . the bugs become infected by feeding on the blood of someone who has the disease . they then excrete infective trypanosomes in their faeces which enter the blood of a subsequent victim through the bite wound . chickens , dogs and opossums also harbour the disease . symptoms include swelling around the site of the bite followed by enlargement of the lymph glands and fever . long term symptoms include damage to the heart causing sudden death and paralysis of the gut causing difficulty in swallowing and severe constipation . there is no vaccine or preventative drug treatment available and treatment of the disease is difficult since no drug is currently able to kill the parasites without harming the host . avoidance of the bites is the best strategy . when travelling through an endemic region try not to sleep in adobe huts where the locals sleep , keep away from walls when sleeping and use mosquito nets . spraying the insides of rooms with an insecticide spray is also a good idea . typhus there are several varieties of typhus all of which cause fever , severe headache and a skin rash and the severity of the illness varies greatly among the different types . in the past , outbreaks of typhus fever have been responsible for thousands of deaths . all forms of typhus fever are caused by tiny organisms called rickettsiae which are passed on to humans by various types of insects including lice ( epidemic ) , fleas ( endemic ) , mites ( scrub ) and ticks . the illness exists world - wide but nowadays , most cases of typhus are confined to areas of central and southern africa , south america and central and south east asia . epidemic typhus is only likely to affect volunteer workers who come into close contact with locals . people who walk through tropical bush should inspect their skin for any attached ticks and carefully remove them . there are no vaccines available for any form of typhus . symptoms of the disease include ; severe headache , fever and skin rashes . the severity of the illness depends on the variety of typhus . the disease can be fatal but responds well to antibiotic therapy using tetracyclines if given early enough . plague otherwise known as the black death , this disease is one of the oldest known and is found world - wide including the usa . in the fourteenth century it spread across europe and was responsible for wiping out one third of the population . the causative organism is a bacterium ( yersinia pestis ) and it is primarily a disease of rodents especially rats . the infection is spread to humans by the bite of the rat flea ( xenopsylla cheopis ) . fleas become infected by feeding on the blood of an infected rodent . when the rodents die the fleas go in search of a new host . they can then transmit the disease to humans who become their hosts . the disease manifests itself in two forms ; bubonic plague and pneumonic plague:- the symptoms of bubonic plague appear suddenly about seven days after exposure and include high fever , headache , muscular aches , shaking chills and pain in the groin and armpits due to the formation of buboes or swollen lymph nodes . untreated , the disease can spread rapidly throughout the body via the lymphatic system . when the lungs become infected an infectious pneumonia may develop ._. _ _ do you want to know the latest news about what is happening within the british national party ? do you want to know the latest news about what is happening in the world ? get details of our latest media coverage , election results , meetings and activities , and the latest news on all the major issues by subscribing to our mailing list . this facility is open to members , supporters and friends throughout the world . the service is completely free of charge . our aim is to increase both the range of subjects offered and the frequency of their publication so that every day the bnp message gets delivered into as many email boxes as possible , creating a genuine patriotic british internet media service . complete the form below . nb . signing up issues ! we are aware of some concerns being reported to us by subscribers of some isps . when you try to sign up to receive our bulletins , a message is returned which rejects the application to subscribe to our bulletins . fear and worry not -

general overview of the season by phases phase 1 - general development of strength , mobility , endurance and basic technique phase 2 - development of specific fitness and advanced technical skills phase 3 - competition experience - achievement of qualification times for main competition phase 4 - adjustment of technical model , preparation for the main competition phase 5 - competition experience and achievement of outdoor objectives phase 6 - active recovery - planning preparation for next season the content of the four week programs in phases four and five depends very much on the athletes progress and competition races . your aim in these phases is to address any limitations the athlete may have in order to bring him / her to a peak of performance for the major competition in phase five . training activities the following are links to the appropriate page for the activities identified on the training programs . circuit training conditioning leg conditioning lower leg conditioning upper body evaluation tests plyometrics stretching exercises warm up and warm down weight training training pace the pace indicated for the sessions is in terms of percentage of a distance pb . e.g. 6 x 120 metres at 80 % of 200 metres tpb . if the athlete has a target personal best ( tpb ) of 22.0 seconds for the 200 metres then running at 80 % pace would require the athlete to complete the 200 metres in 27.5 seconds , ( 22 � 0.8 ) so the 120 metres should be completed in 16.5 seconds . remember to use the athlete 's tpb for this coming season otherwise all that the training will do is maintain their current pb . training pace calculator enter the session distance , the session intensity , your pb for the session intensity distance , and then select the ' calculate ' button . the session distance is metres the session intensity is % of tpb my tpb for the session intensity distance is seconds the time for the session distance is seconds evaluation tests the following evaluation tests can be used to monitor the sprint athlete 's development : 10 stride test for 100 metres and 200 metres athletes 150 metres endurance test for 100 metres athletes 250 metres endurance test for 200 metres athletes 30 metre acceleration test for 100 metres and 200 metres athletes 60 metre speed test for 100 metres and 200 metres athletes balke vo2 max test for endurance cooper vo2 max test for endurance flying 30 metres speed test for 100 metres and 200 metres athletes harvard step test -

reviewed papers pre - prints , grey literature and theses additional services were also developed including an open access e - journal ( jelit ) and a subject - based repository for the erpanet project ( erpaeprints ) . the project finished at the end of july 2005 but its range of services and activities are now being taken forward by the university of the glasgow . its key service , the glasgow eprints service [ 3 ] is the focus of this article . key aims the key aims of the project were : to establish and populate a range of oai - compliant digital collections at the university of glasgow using a range of different oai - compliant pieces of software . to act as a catalyst for cultural change and ongoing discussions about the " crisis in scholarly communication " within the university of glasgow and the wider community . to disseminate our experiences and findings to the wider community through reports , workshops , exemplars and guides to best practice in the development of these services . the daedalus project met these key aims and established a successful " proof of concept " advocacy campaign , a range of oai - compliant data providers and a rich collection of high - quality research papers and other scholarly content . the project also set up a pilot local oai - compliant search provider to enable ease of access to these collections . over the three years of the project 's lifetime this work has been widely , and internationally disseminated at conferences , workshops and jisc meetings . in june 2005 we ran an institutional repositories workshop [ 4 ] which was attended by 35 colleagues from other scottish and uk institutions . a complete listing of the project 's dissemination activities can be found on the daedalus web site [ 5 ] . approach and findings the project 's overall approach was a twin - track one of service development and advocacy activities . this approach recognised the critical nature of advocacy ( and cultural change ) and ensured that engagement with academics was maintained throughout the project . the key findings of the project included the : demonstration of the success of the twin - track approach of advocacy and service development importance of ongoing and active engagement with academic colleagues . this is a critical component of advocacy and has assisted our institution 's culture to move more towards one of open access effectiveness of the mediated submission model in pump - priming content for populating the services need to address and understand the challenges which copyright poses for different content including published and peer - reviewed papers and theses . recognition of the range of technical expertise necessary to install , develop and maintain the institutional repository service . the project has also written a range of reports , in addition to the presentations and papers produced which cover these findings in much greater detail and these are available on the project web site . advocacy the development of an institutional advocacy campaign was one of the key activities undertaken by the project . while there was some awareness of the concept of open access at glasgow , the majority of academics were not familiar with repositories . a wide range of strategies for securing content for the repository were employed - these are detailed in a previous article in ariadne [ 6 ] . these were successful in helping to populate the repository , while being very resource intensive . the project was successful in gaining the support of a number of academic departments which agreed to contact being added for all members of staff subject to availability of full text and copyright transfer agreements . by the end of the project an increasing number of departments had made similar requests . this was a very satisfying development , as it indicated that the advocacy campaign had achieved the desired effect . further details of the institutional advocacy campaign pursued by the project are available in guidelines produced by document staff [ 7 ] . closely related to the advocacy campaign was the need to work with authors and publishers on copyright issues . early on in the project it became clear that copyright was a major concern for authors , and most authors wanted to be reassured that publisher copyright agreements would be checked by project staff before papers were made available in the repository . there have been significant changes in publishers ' attitudes to repositories during the three years of the project . initially many publishers did not permit deposit in repositories , although some did give permission if contacted directly . publishers have since started to become more responsive to demands from authors and many now permit authors to deposit their final version of a paper in repositories . while this is a positive move , discussions with authors have revealed that many do not have a suitable copy and do not have time to create one . the problem of multiple versions of a paper being deposited in multiple repositories is also an issue . while the majority of content in the glasgow eprints service consists of published papers and conference papers , a number of books and book chapters have now been made available . copyright checking for this sort of material is fairly labour - intensive as each publisher has to be contacted individually to seek permission . agreements signed by book authors with publishers do not tend to indicate whether deposit in a repository is permitted . so far publishers have been willing to allow deposit where the material is a few years old or indeed out of print , presumably on the basis that there are likely to be few further opportunities to generate revenue . the books and book chapters available in the eprints service have been downloaded heavily since their deposit , and feedback from the authors concerned has been extremely positive . in particular , an out of print book in the area of celtic studies deposited towards the end of august 2005 has already been downloaded over 600 times ( by the end of october 2005 ) . the inclusion of books in a repository raises the issue of the possible implications on author royalties . however , some authors are more interested in seeing their work widely read . it is also the case that some studies have demonstrated that making a book available online can have a positive impact on sales . one of the key outcomes of the project that has helped to persuade academics of the benefits of deposit has been the usage statistics for publications held in the eprints service . as mentioned previously , books available in the eprints service have been heavily used . journal articles are also attracting impressive access and downloads . at the time of writing the most frequently used item in the repository has been downloaded over 1700 times ; the top 50 items have all been downloaded over 200 times . such statistics are critical in demonstrating that making articles available in repositories has the effect of making them more visible . our content is also available in yahoo and google and has been registered with google scholar and elsevier 's scirus search tool . this has enabled us to demonstrate further this increased visibility . service development the project used a range of software including gnu eprints , dspace , etd - db and the initial installation of these was completed by the end of the first year . the work was then focussed on the development and configuration of the services in parallel with the advocacy work . a pilot search service using the pkp harvester was installed in the final year . all of the software was installed on a single sun server running solaris . details of our initial experiences with gnu eprints and dspace are available in ariadne [ 8 ] . with this range of software we took the strategic decision at the outset to second ( on a part - time basis ) technical expertise from the computing service department in the university . the risk of a loss of this expert support if we had recruited a temporary post was felt to be too great for a project which relied on a ( new ) technical infrastructure . this decision also provided us with long term sustainability and technical expertise beyond the life of the project which will support its ongoing development . the open source software we have used is less straightforward to install , support and configure than commercial software and requires more expertise to troubleshoot and test . we are using both gnu eprints and dspace for different content types but have done more work with the eprints service and have more experience with perl rather than java ( which dspace uses ) . the project 's key service is running on gnu eprints . the glasgow eprints service was launched in june 2004 and it now has over 1800 records with over 360 full text papers . figure 1 : screenshot of the glasgow eprints service home page early in the first year it was decided to include both bibliographic records as well as those for full text in the eprints service . this decision reflected the challenges which copyright posed in securing the full text of papers and was similar to that of the university of southampton 's tardis project which also decided to accept both full text and bibliographic records [ 9 ] . we felt that it was important to find full text papers in our service easily , so a new field was added which indicated whether a record held the full text of a paper or not ; this has enabled us easily to limit searches to full text content only . the default search in eprints was initially set to search only for full text records but by late 2004 this was changed to search for all records in the service . the proportion of records which only had bibliographic details at that time was 3 to 1 and it was felt that the default results did not reflect the full range of content available . academic colleagues had also indicated that they felt it was confusing if a search for their papers only listed the full text papers held in the service and not all of their publications . in addition to this , our decision to hold , initially , just published and peer - reviewed journal papers in the glasgow eprints service enabled us to make a wide range of changes to both the default deposit process ( to remove the mandatory deposit of full text ) and the metadata fields which would be used and displayed . these included an acknowledgement of prior publication and an indication of any permissions which we had sought to make the content publicly available . we have mapped these fields to the appropriate unqualified dublin core fields for oai - pmh ( open archives initiative - protocol for metadata harvesting ) harvesting , e.g. copyright , reproduction rights map to the dublin core ' rights ' fields . figure 2 : screenshot of an eprints record we have also written scripts to allow bibliographic details to be imported from publications databases using software such as reference manager and endnote into the eprints service . many departments within the university were already using these software packages to hold publications internally , and we felt that it would be important to be able to work with these systems rather than expecting existing data to be entered into the eprints service from scratch . the scripts are available in our dspace service [ 10 ] . these scripts have been a key component in the mediated submission model which we have used to populate our eprints service ; further details about this model are available in the report " populating the glasgow eprints service : a mediated model and workflow " [ 11 ] . during the lifetime of the project a number of unexpected outcomes and opportunities emerged . most notably the development of additional services to support interest in open access publishing across the university : jelit ( journal of eliteracy ) an open access journal [ 12 ] erpaeprints : a subject - based institutional repository [ 13 ] conclusion the repository services set up by daedalus have given us an opportunity to work closely with academic departments which previously did not have much involvement with the library . this has included opportunities to work with publications databases created by departments and to advise them on the range of metadata required . it has also enabled us to host content such as working papers , technical reports and user manuals they have created in dspace . at the university of glasgow we see the glasgow eprints service and the glasgow dspace service [ 14 ] as complementary , and this has enabled us to take a twin - track approach to our advocacy work in gathering differing content which presents different challenges . the work of daedalus has demonstrated that an institutional repository service is greater than the sum of its parts and requires a range of skills and staff to implement it effectively and ensure its ongoing sustainability . both these services are now being taken forward by the university and our challenge now is to maintain the momentum of advocacy and cultural change which daedalus has started . early indications from departments and faculties are encouraging with an increasing number ready to add their content to the service . acknowledgements our thanks to our daedalus colleagues stephen gallacher , lesley drysdale and joan keenan whose work and assistance have been invaluable in delivering our range of services . references daedalus web site http://www.gla.ac.uk/daedalus fair programme web site http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=programme glasgow eprints service web site http://eprints.gla.ac.uk developing an institutional repository : issues and challenges http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/daedalus/workshop/ daedalus documentation http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/daedalus/docs/index.html mackie , m. , " filling institutional repositories : practical strategies from the daedalus project " , ariadne 39 , april 2004 http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue39/mackie/ greig , m. , " institutional advocacy campaign : guidelines and practical advice " , daedalus project report , 2005 http://hdl.handle.net/1905/377 nixon , william " daedalus : initial experiences with eprints and dspace " , ariadne 37 , october 2003 http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue37/nixon/ simpson , p. , " tardis project final report . southampton uk , university of southampton , " university library , 2005 http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/16122/ drysdale , lesley , " importing records from reference manager into gnu eprints " , daedalus project report , 2005 http://hdl.handle.net/1905/175 nixon , william j. and greig , morag , " populating the glasgow eprints service : a mediated model and workflow " , daedalus project report , 2005 http://hdl.handle.net/1905/387 jelit , journal of eliteracy http://www.jelit.org erpaeprints repository http://eprints.erpanet.org glasgow dspace service http://dspace.gla.ac.uk author details morag greig project manager ( advocacy ) , daedalus university of glasgow email : m.greig@lib.gla.ac.uk web site : http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/daedalus william j nixon project manager ( service development ) , daedalus university of glasgow email : w.nixon@lib.gla.ac.uk web site : http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/daedalus return to top article title : " daedalus : delivering the glasgow eprints service " author : morag greig and william j nixon publication date : 30-october-2005 publication : ariadne issue 45 originating url : http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue45/greig-nixon/intro.html copyright and citation information file last modified : sunday , 30-oct-2005 16:25:52 gmt ariadne is published every three months by ukoln . ukoln is funded by mla the museums , libraries and archives council , the joint information systems committee ( jisc ) of the higher education funding councils , as well as by project funding from the jisc and the european union . ukoln also receives support from the university of bath where it is based . material referred to on this page is copyright ariadne ( university of bath ) and original authors_nns _ _ 70 south lambeth road london sw8 1rl tel : 020 7735 7845 , fax : 020 7840 5811 sms : 07921 700 089 , email : info@nrac.org.uk database of members | news and events | contact us | accessibility | resources you are here : home > members > continuing professional development continuing professional development download the cpd form in word format download the cpd form in pdf format continuing professional development is the systematic maintenance , improvement and broadening of knowledge and skills and developing of personal qualities necessary for the execution of professional duties throughout the professional 's working life . activities contributing to cpd include formalised training courses and less formal educational activities that contribute to the technical or professional experience of the member . examples of activities in the access field , which could constitute part of a structured cpd plan include : technical and professional conferences , lectures , workshops , seminars and courses teaching / tutoring and mentoring practice ( those in teaching posts ) writing articles for the technical and professional press structured home learning : open and distance learning in -

barbera who in turn assigned the task to writers ken spears and joe ruby . what the writers came up with was a story of four teenage detectives who travelled the country in a van ( called the mystery machine ) , solving mysteries and getting out of dangerous situations . a great dane accompanied the foursome on their travels but was not a leading character . the show 's first working title was mysteries five before being presented to frank stanton , president of cbs , as who 's scared ? a new saturday morning cartoon for the fall of 1969 . however , stanton rejected the show on the grounds of the artwork being too scary and unsuitable for it 's intended , young audience . the same night that the show was rejected fred silverman took a flight back to los angeles , and , whilst relaxing to the sound of frank sinatra 's strangers in the night through his earphones , the line ' scooby - dooby - doo ' struck him with sudden inspiration . it was there and then that silverman decided to call the programme scooby - doo , where are you ? and make the dog the star of the show . and so the idea was developed with scooby taking the lead , accompanied by human companions shaggy ( a bumbling teenager who kept the star of the show well stocked in his favourite scooby - snacks ) , velma ( the brains of the team ) , daphne ( always the first in trouble ) and freddy ( the leader of the group ) as they travelled the country unearthing criminal goings on , which more often than not involved the bad guys dressing up as ghosts or ghouls in order to commit their crimes . one way or another ( and not always with scooby 's help as he was usually the first to run for cover ) , the gang managed to solve the mystery and put an end to the criminal 's activities . the series , which leant more towards comedy than mystery , premiered in september 1969 and became a massive hit for cbs , who , in 1972 , changed the format in order to create the new scooby - doo comedy movies . after seven years with cbs , scooby moved to abc where he continued his adventures well into the 1980 's . in these later seasons scooby was joined by his pup nephew , scrappy - doo , and occasional guest spots from a whole host of his canine relatives . blessed with a perfect basic format , central characters who were simply but brilliantly designed , allied to expertly judged vocal performances , scooby - doo has gone on to become an iconically seminal cartoon series whose influence is subtly acknowledged by even such modern prime time genre classics as the x - files and buffy the vampire slayer . alongside the flintstones and the simpsons , scooby - doo ( now a major motion picture ) is regarded as one of televisions animated classics . character voices scooby - doo don messick | shaggy casey kasem | freddy frank welker | velma nicole jaffe | daphne heather north created by : created by : fred silverman , ken spears , joe ruby . produced by : william hanna , joseph barbera . directors included : oscar dufau , george gordon , charles a. nichols , ray patterson , carl urbano . writers included : ken spears , carl urbano . 72 episodes of 30 minute duration between 1969 -

term and long - term . english freemasonry is relatively cheap nowadays when compared to what it cost only 20 or so years ago . our dues have not kept pace with inflation and despite savings and increased efficiency our overall costs have risen . the same can be said for the charitable contribution and this now needs to be addressed . this review is a major exercise and will entail consultation with many relevant parties before any recommendations are made to grand lodge . we are well aware of the constraints on the finances of some of our older and younger brethren , and will be exploring ways to try and limit the impact of any increases on those who can least afford it . brethren , on behalf of the mw grand master and my fellow rulers , i would like to wish you and your families peace and joy for the festive season , and a prosperous and happy new year . announcements the mw the grand master had made the following appointments : w bro robert william rego to be grand superintendent of the bermuda group of lodges and the chapter in bermuda , in succession to vw bro charles kempe jr , who retired on 31 december . w bro dr virendra kumar talwar pgswdb to be district grand master for and grand superintendent in and over east eafrica , in succession to rw bro sir " andy " chande kbe , who is to retire on 8 april 2005 as district grand master , and on 23 september 2005 as grand superintendent . bro talwar is to be installed on 9 april and 24 september respectively . w bro john graham russell psgd to be provincial grand master for derbyshire in succession to rw bro david law , who is to retire on 15 april 2005 . bro rudd is due to be installed on 16 april . w bro john stuart rushmer pjgd to be provincial grand master for , and grand superintendent in and over norfolk , in succession to rw bro major ian bruce , who is to retire on 4 october 2005 . bro rushmer is due to be installed on 6 october . the first grand principal has appointed e comp james randolph bain pgstb to be grand superintendent in and over bahamas and turks in succession to e comp peter cole , who retired on 12 november . e comp dr richard john horace neale pgstb to be grand superintendent in and over buckinghamshire in succession to e comp dr eric hall . comp neale is due to be installed on 24 october 2005 ._. _ _ riverside has a varied programme of both domestic and international performance , theatre , dance and other events and considers work , either hires or co -

two speakers and a performance poet . it was , as usual , an opportunity to greet old friends and to make the acquaintance of new members and interested people . altogether the day was a huge success with plenty of discussion and action . the two speakers , toyin okitikpi and simon barth , provided us with important information about the circumstances of mixed race children in certain sectors of the mixed race community with chair . this was timely , as information on the position of mixed race children in relation to the education system and the criminal justice system has just been made available through two government sponsored research reports . the short message from this is that mixed race children and their families , particular those enduring economic hardship , do not fare well in relation to state funded institutions . this point was further extended in toyin 's talk about mixed race children and the public care system . he opened up the possibility that mixed race children are more likely to enter the care system and less likely to have their particular needs understood once in care . this problem has been around for a long time but it is reassuring that , finally , there are social workers and ( perhaps more importantly ) social work educators ready to investigate the questions of both quantity and quality in the area . simon barth gave an account of the multiple heritage project which targets mixed race children and their families in the city of sheffield . painting a dire portrait of high rates of school exclusions , criminality and other markers of social exclusion amongst the mixed race community in the city , simon spoke about the project 's work in attempting to address the negativity around mixed race . he argued that the work of the project could be taken up nationally as a model for projects in other cities with similar experiences amongst the mixed race groups . although these two speakers each gave a rather gloomy picture , there is a very positive side to each of their stories . on the one hand these matters are now being discussed more openly ( yes , the facts are very shocking in the cold light of day ) and on the other this airing enables the issues to be addressed rather than denied or hidden . our performance poet , anthony joseph , lifted our spirits by reading some beautiful poems including one about his small daughter who was present for the day . he has published some of his work and this is well worth a read . we were delighted to have rob worrall chair the afternoon . he talked about his journey to trace and meet his nigerian father after no contact during the years he was growing up ( april 2004 newsletter ) . rob is researching for a book he 's writing that will help others wanting to trace an absent african birth parent and would like to hear from people interested in contributing to the book . so thanks to the speakers and everyone who helped to make the day a great success . we are left with plenty to think about and , as an organisation , decisions about how best to address the challenges presented by the content of the talks . if you did n't make it this year , hope to see you next year . these are exciting times for the mixed race community and for people in harmony ._. _ _ readings by email ( or phone by request ) from � 10 to � 40 if you have n't already done so , please read the information about readings before ordering , so that you choose exactly the right one for your needs . charges below are the relevant charges for the different readings . by clicking the buy now button , you will be taken to the secure online payment method using paypal . you can use credit or debit card and can also pose your question(s ) at the same time using the space provided for a message .

"_'' _ _ reviewed by terry lawton these two wading jackets � greys � grx and hardy � s flyweight � are an interesting pair to compare . before doing so , how , why and when do you wear a wading jacket ? as a trout fisherman , i would always carry one with me when fishing in areas where there is the potential for quick and major changes in the weather such as in the arctic , or , nearer to home , if i felt that rain was likely . i would use it to keep dry , firstly , and warm secondly . in the winter i do go pike fishing in a wading jacket . it keeps me warm and because i don � t need to carry much equipment with me when fly - fishing for pike , i can put everything i need in the pockets . that is the only time that i would use the pockets of a wading jacket . my understanding is that salmon fishermen would use a wading jacket much more , putting everything they need in the pockets , rather than fishing in a waistcoat like most trout fishermen . if you are wearing a waistcoat , why do you need lots of pockets in a wading jacket ? quite simply , in my opinion you don � t . the greys � grx wading jacket follows the traditional approach with plenty of pockets , both front and back . in comparison , the hardy jacket takes a completely different approach � there are no pockets . greys grx the grx is made from soft , flexible and reasonably quiet , breathable material . it is well cut and you soon forget that you are wearing it . the grx has a strap so that the hood can be rolled - up and kept out of the way when not wanted . there are handy tabs on all the zip pulls which makes them easier to find , particularly for the back cargo pocket . there are triple front pockets either side : hand warmer , one with access via a vertical zip and the third by a top flap with velcro closure , and a small zipped pocket behind the storm flap for the main zip , ideal for car keys or a mobile � phone . this flap is closed with velcro and press studs . the main front pockets have a clip each to hang things on ; there is a d - ring on the back and two velcro rod - holder straps . for me one of the most important points about a wading jacket is the cuffs . do they stop rainwater running down your sleeves when your arms are in the air casting ? to test this i turned to the garden hose . the grx has adjustable storm cuffs , with velcro straps , and non - adjustable inner cuffs of neoprene and a stretchy nylon material . i played the hose over my hand and , while this is perhaps more severe than fishing in heavy rain , i did get a wet shirt sleeve , much to my disappointment . the inner cuff system certainly keeps the wind out but it is not fully watertight . the recommended uk retail price is � 129 . hardy flyweight the hardy minimalist � no pockets � approach does mean that there are no hand - warmer pockets for cold , wet days . this is worth remembering if you suffer from cold hands . but this jacket does fold - up into a roll about the size of a 1 lb trout and so it can be carried very easily in the back pocket of most fishing waistcoats . this is a big � plus � and should mean an end to getting caught in an unexpected shower of rain . access to your waistcoat is via a long diagonal zip ( with cord pull ) either side of the front . there is a simple flap over the main zip , closed with bits of velcro . the cuffs are elasticated with velcro straps to tighten them . how did these get on when pitched against the garden hose ? very much better than i expected ! in fact , they weren � t significantly worse than the grx . this is probably because it is easier to get the cuffs really tight with the adjuster strap . i wonder if hardy could be persuaded to add a simple , non - adjustable neoprene inner cuff ? something simple in keeping with the simple approach of this jacket . there is a simple hood , with an adjuster , that folds up into the collar and a d - ring on the back . that � s it . the material , which is a pleasant green colour and very lightweight , is breathable . it � s a bit noisier than the material used by greys . i will be reporting on this jacket � s durability and other qualities during the coming season , after i have fished in it in the rain . its first outing was on a day of april showers and it did its job of keeping me dry . all - in - all , it � s an innovative response to keeping dry when fishing in the rain in waders . the hardy flyweight has a uk recommended retail price of � 59.99 . update ... since writing this appraisal terry lawton has worn the hardy wading jacket in anger . he wore it on a cold and miserable april day when it rained steadily all afternoon . the jacket did everything that was expected of it . it kept the rain and wind out and no water found its way through the cuff seal . access to the waistcoat pockets was very good , via the long diagonal zips , although the velcro which holds the storm flaps over the zips hindered them from opening with one straight pull . it paid to release the velcro before opening the zip ._. _ _ aussie sa in trouble march 10 2005 marcus larsen reports from the socialist alliance in australia , which seems to be going the same way as the sa in britain letter to � green left weekly � from iso arrogant swp buries sa february 10 2005 peter manson reports from the ( last ever ?

- michael collins glad to know i have n't fallen into total journo obscurity . cool . thanks . turning people onto the bands that mattered most to me back then is , in a lot of ways still the ethic . how cool is it that an a&r man can take a band like glassjaw or ill nino basically bands you 've never heard of , and deliver that record to thousands and hopefully millions of people . so for me , both careers have had a very similar motivation : turning people onto music . as far as " do you miss it " ? only on rare occasion . it was just as awesome being the first person to turn people onto , say , rage against the machine or helmet as it was writing about more obscure bands like the obsessed . the thrill now is about putting a lot of yourself and your energies behind a band and seeing that vision through . it 's immensely rewarding seeing a band go from playing infront of 50 people at cbgb 's to headlining infront of massive crowds . there 's no rush like it . as far as writing goes , i still will write the occasional band bio and yes , there 's that half - finished movie script that i 've been tooling on for months , but on every level , what i 'm doing now is a lot more rewarding . 2 . have you noticed that new roadrunner records signings tend to be a lot more light weight these days ? do you think this is because metal in general is dumbing down , or is it for a more commercial reason ? - satannica obviously , as roadrunner has grown bigger , as a&r people we have to look toward bands that have a bigger future than simply being another run - of - the - mill metal or hardcore band . don't worry though ! roadrunner has things planned for the next few years that will redefine the face of heavy music in the same way that roadrunner has always set the benchmark with bands like slipknot , fear factory and sepultura . is metal dumbing down ? hell no . look at the success of bands like at the drive in or our own glassjaw . bands like that are part of metal 's continued evolution . around these parts , we 're looking for the proverbial " what comes next ? " and i think we 're delivering it on all fronts . keep your eyes on bands like 36 crazyfists and ill nino to set the standard for the next generation . 3 . mike , how come you have continued to lag on downer ? is it because of your blatant homosexual tendencies ? you clearly dropped the ball only to have the band take care of themselves ! ! you suck at a / r and your , so called , " penis " is nothing more than an oversized clitoris . maybe victory records could use an a / r guy . fag . - john scott john , i 'm sick of your continued sexual harrassment . and no , for the last time , i wo n't come up to your huntington beach bungalow to watch " gladiator " in our speedo bathing suits . 4 . where do you see glassjaw in a year from now ? tom tierney like ross robinson says : glassjaw the start of a whole new rock revolution . they 're one of the most important bands in the world . expect a new record from this new york fivesome that gives them the sort of long - lasting respect of a band like , say , the cure or rem with no sell - out or compromise whatsoever . in the tradition of great bands like the deftones or incubus , glassjaw will take a couple records to really sink into the world at large , but when they do , it 's all over . darryl palumbo is one of the most talented people i 've ever worked with in my life . i 've heard a couple new songs so far and i definitely think people are in for a surprise 5 . why did you decide to sign a punk band ( the misfits ) to a mainly metal label ? - mark " the ( sic)ness " storr dude , the misfits are the misfits . not metal or punk . what they do is totally unique and totally their own . the misfits are a great american rock band , simple fact , it 's great music that spans the boundaries from the metal - on - metal blister of records like " earth a.d. " to 50 's doo - wop on songs like " crying on a saturday night " . undeniable and explosive . what made me sign them ? hell , i 've been a fan since seeing glenn danzig lead the devil - locked charge back in the day and when the misfits came back with a new singer and drummer , they came back on - fire and absolutely as powerful as they ever were . i was struck , totally struck by the idea of what jerry and doyle created many years ago , finally coming to fruition . since then , they 've really made their claim as one of the hardest workning , relentlessly touring and best live bands out there . 6 . are most a&r departments made up almost entirely of deaf nitwits ? - kieron clarke i 'm sorry kieron , what did you say ? ca n't hear you . too busy listening to demos , making great records and trying to fix your hearing . cool ? 7 . . i have a question , what does it take to get a record company to notice you ? we have been featured on channel 4 's big breakfast show winning the battle of the bands , we are supporting bands such as the selecter on the 17th november and bad manners on the 6th december , we always get a very good response from the gigs we play , we have been asked by clubs to be their resident band , we have topped the charts on iuma.com and are currently at number 5 in all genres , and number 2 in the ska charts . check us out at www.20deadcamels.co.uk . thank you for reading this mail and giving us the chance to ask you these questions . - cliff cummings ( 20 dead camels ) good plug cliff ! what does it take to get a record company to take a look at you ? exactly what you 're doing : just being out there , playing your ass off and being as visible as you can be . if you 're good , eventually , the record companies stand up and take notice . there 's hundreds of companies on every level : major , major - indie like roadrunner or indies . sometimes it takes a while and it can be subject to whatever trend is happening at the time , honestly , i do n't think we 're looking for much in the way of a ska act these days but i 'm always game to put on the pork pie hat and mash it up . check the website faq info on how to submit a demo , address it to me and i 'll give it a listen . 8 . what do you think of claims that roadrunner are selling out by getting rid of nearly all their hardcore bands and signing nu - metal acts ? - gareth anderson not true at all . there was no decision to " get rid of " any or all of our hardcore bands . in each case , it was down to the band . for instance , madball had done three records with the label and it was n't worthwhile for both and the band and roadrunner to continue with another . vod was totally unstable at the time and had basically broken up . earth crisis made a lot of promises about how they wanted to grow as a band and ultimately delivered a record that did n't reflect that . great record , but not the one we needed them to make . consequently , they did n't show much growth into the metal band that they wanted to be . again , it was very much of a mutual decision that found them back at victory , as far as roadrunner signing exclusively nu - metal bands that 's totally untrue . we 're looking for great , edgy , hard - rockin ' bands : nu - metal , hardcore , straightforward rock leaders rather than followers . 9 . are roadrunner going to sign more international acts or are they going to stick with the more commercially viable us acts ? - gareth anderson while the focus has largely been on us acts , there 's nothing saying roadrunner would n't go after something on an international level if it was something that roadrunner as a company was totally excited about . honestly , one of the key , roadrunner artists , sepultura , do n't exactly come from brooklyn now do they ? 10 . i have heard that there is at least one tale of " the one that got away " in every a&r wardrobe ... so who did you see , decide not to sign and have since become a big(ish ) name ..... who did you kick your self over ? - tut honestly , you ca n't get everything you 're excited about nor is every band a perfect fit at a specific company . so , i 'm blessed to have been able to sign the acts i have . ok , now what are some of the great ones that got away ? hmmmm .... at the drive in , most recently . though , in fairness , the earlier records were a little rougher and certainly not as sharply focused as " relationship of command " . over the years ? and this includes a four year stint at atlantic : rancid prior to " out come the wolves " . here 's one : creed . everyone passed on that one at first . creed was written off as a pearl jam / stp wannabe ! it also did n't help that they had a terrible show in nyc when they came to showcase here . well , a lot of a&r men were proved wrong very quickly with that one . 11 . your role is one of great responsibility to the kids who buy music and the label for which you work for , what out of work stuff do you do to make sure that you are in the same frame of mind as " where the kids are at " ? how do you make sure you are tuned into find the right band for the market ? - tut it 's really a question of being " down " . just being on the street seeing what kids are listening to , what shows they 're going to , what t - shirts they 're wearing . listen to records . read magazines . scroll the web . again , i 'll go to the case of ill nino . there was a band that was totally unavoidable in their market . 800 , 900 kids at their shows on local radio just a total buzz ... and they were great live and the music was great . how do you stay in tune with " the kids " " the market " ? keep your ears and eyes open and do your homework . 12 . if someone came along and said " what area of your catalogue do you want filling " and could provide you with the music , image and whole package you really needed at that time , so fitting your brief rather than forging your brief , would you be interested ? - tut honestly , i 'd have to personally be passionate about whatever it is your offering to get involved ... if i understand your question correctly . thanks for all the questions you sent in - see you on tour real soon ! !_. _ _ models of care for the treatment of drug misusers promoting quality , efficiency and effectiveness in drug misuse treatment services in england part 2 : full reference report chapter 4 : cross - cutting issues 4.3 psychiatric co - morbidity ( dual diagnosis ) 4.3.1 description there is no agreed definition of the term dual diagnosis , which refers to two concurrent disorders . therefore , to avoid misinterpretation , for the purposes of models of care , the term will be referred to as psychiatric co - morbidity , meaning a combination of mental illness and substance misuse . it is recognised that co - morbidity covers a broad spectrum of mental health and substance misuse problems that an individual might experience concurrently ( department of health 2002 ) . krausz ( 1996 ) suggests that there are four categories of dual diagnosis : a primary diagnosis of a major mental illness with a subsequent ( secondary diagnosis ) of substance misuse which adversely affects mental health a primary diagnosis of drug dependence with psychiatric complications leading to mental illness a concurrent substance misuse and psychiatric disorder an underlying traumatic experience resulting in both substance misuse and mood disorders e.g. post - traumatic stress disorder . identification of the primary diagnosis may be problematic . this is because of the mimicking effect of signs and symptoms of mental illness by signs of intoxication and withdrawal of substance use , which can lead to misdiagnosis . it is necessary , therefore , to assess symptoms and syndromes to identify a disorder as characterised by a particular classification system ( wittchen et al . 1996 ) , such as diagnostic and statistical manual ( dsm ) iv or international classification for diseases ( icd ) 10 . the nature of the relationships between mental disorders and substance misuse use are complex for the following reasons : substance use ( even one dose ) and withdrawal from substances may lead to psychiatric syndromes or symptoms intoxication and dependence may produce psychological symptoms substance use may exacerbate or alter the course of a pre - existing mental disorder primary mental disorder may precipitate substance use disorder which in itself may lead to psychiatric syndromes ( crome 1996 ) . 4.3.2 epidemiology 4.3.2.1 prevalence psychiatric co - morbidity ( dual diagnosis ) is recognised as a complex area of health and social care . it requires further research in the uk , since the evidence base to date is primarily based on studies in the usa ( ley et al . 2000 ) . the available evidence base provides a framework for further uk studies . baigent et al . ( 1994 ) , in a study carried out in australia , found that among 53 psychiatric hospital inpatients with a diagnosis of substance abuse and schizophrenia , 40 % abused mainly alcohol , 40 % abused cannabis , 8 % amphetamines and 20 % abused more than one substance . of these 80 % reported substance use for the relief of anxiety and dysphoria . in the usa , reiger et al . ( 1990 ) found that 47 % of schizophrenic patients , and 61 % bipolar ( manic depressive ) patients , had a substance - related disorder . lifetime prevalence rates of anti - social personality disorder in drug abuse categories in untreated populations ranged between 14.7 % for cannabis to 42.7 % for cocaine ( reiger et al . 1990 ) . kessler et al . ( 1996 ) found that between 1 % and 65.5 % of those with an addictive disorder also had at least one mental disorder and 51 % of those with mental disorder had at least one addictive disorder . in canada , russell et al . ( 1994 ) found that lifetime prevalence rates of anti - social personality disorder in drug abuse categories in untreated populations ranged between 10.4 % ( barbiturates ) to 78.5 % ( cannabis ) . in the uk , glass and jackson ( 1988 ) found that 10 % of psychiatric inpatients had an alcohol problem and 40 % of those with alcohol problems had a dual diagnosis . ghodse ( 1995b ) reported that co - morbidity of substance misuse and personality disorder account for the majority of co - morbid patients . crawford ( 1996 ) found that individuals with schizophrenia have a three - fold risk of developing alcohol dependence compared with individuals without a mental illness . in 1998 , oyefeso et al . found that the prevalence rate of personality disorder among drug - dependent inpatients was 86 % , and the rates for histrionic , dependent and avoidant borderline personality disorder was 44 % , 36 % , and 76 % respectively . overall prevalence of substance use disorder in mental health patients in the uk was 36.3 % ( menezes et al . 1996 ) . 4.3.3 research evidence base 4.3.3.1 effectiveness of treatment and interventions lehman ( 1995 as cited in ley et al . 2000 ) found that abuse of alcohol or drugs is associated with increased rates of violence and suicide , poor compliance with treatment , early psychotic breakdown , homelessness , criminal behaviour and increased rates of hospitalisation among the severely mentally ill . in a prospective study of integrated outpatient treatment for substance - abusing schizophrenic patients in new york , usa , hellerstein ( 1995 ) found there was no clear difference between the integrated and non - integrated treatment programmes . although the result was approaching statistical significance in favour of the integrated programme in terms of ' lost to treatment ' , 64 % of people in the trial did not continue their treatment . there was no statistical significance between integrated and non - integrated treatment programmes for mental state outcomes . in new hampshire , usa , drake ( 1995 as cited in ley et al . 2000 ) undertook a review of integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment for patients with dual disorders . there was no difference between assertive community treatment ( act ) and the other programme on the number of people lost to treatment . there were seven deaths in the two groups across the three years of the study . there was no difference in mental state between the two groups or in the use of substance between the two groups and there was no clear difference between the two groups on life satisfaction . burnam et al . ( 1995 ) undertook an experimental evaluation of residential and non - residential treatment for dually diagnosed homeless adults in los angeles , california . the study found a significant difference between the two groups for ' lost to treatment ' in favour of residential treatment , and no clear difference in substance use at nine months ( scores likely to be skewed ) . 4.3.3.2 service utilisation studies in the usa found that individuals with dual diagnosis seek treatment more frequently than those with one disorder ( narrow et al . 1993 ) and more than 40 % of those with three or more disorders have never received any treatment ( kessler et al . 1996 ) . in the uk , 26 % of suicides ( nationally ) with a recent history of non - contact with services had a history of drug misuse ; 26 % of suicides ( nationally ) with a recent history of disengagement from services had a history of drug misuse ; 38 % of suicides ( nationally ) with a recent history of non - contact with services had a history of alcohol misuse ; and 38 % of suicides ( nationally ) with a recent history of disengagement with services had a history of alcohol misuse ( department of health 1999b ) . 4.3.4 treatment there is no one model of service provision which has been found to be the most effective for managing this client group . service provision must be based on local needs assessment of the prevalence of those clients accessing both mental health and substance misuse services . the table below describes four themes of service delivery and suggests potential problems and difficulties of each model . table 2 : models of treatment and potential difficulties model of treatment description problems / difficulties consecutive treatment ( franey and quirk 1996 ) also known as ' serial ' treatment model treatment programmes are provided consecutively by the mental health services and substance misuse services depending on the presenting problem limited communication between the services health problems treated as separate entities patients are shunted between the two services parallel treatment ( franey and quirk 1996 ) the care of the patient is provided by both services concurrently , facilitated by communication between the two services patients are shunted between the two services health problems are treated as separate entities medical responsibility not clearly defined integrated treatment ( minkoff and drake 1991 ) the care of the patient is jointly managed by both services ( designated service ) isolated from mainstream services views dual diagnosis as a static condition expensive service provision joint liaison / collaborative approach the care of the patient is jointly managed by both services joint working between mental health and substance misuse services joint responsibility ensures the skills and expertise of both spheres of healthcare is utilised the model of collaborative working facilitates capitalising on the skills and expertise of the general mental health services and the specialist substance misuse services . while assertive community outreach programmes are favoured in the usa ( weaver et al . 1999 ) as a model of management , there is limited supportive evidence for effectiveness of this approach in the uk . there is no clear evidence supporting the advantage of any model as a preference over others ( health advisory service 2001a ; ley et al . 2001 ) , each local area needs to identify the appropriate approach according to local needs and service configurations . irrespective of the model adopted , services need to have close collaboration with other providers involved in the care of the patient and carers . those involved in the care of the patient need to identify a named care co - ordinator with responsibility for co - ordinating care and a lead medical officer with responsibility for the care of the patient . treatment approaches will need to be as varied as the individuals presenting with co - morbid mental health and substance misuse problems . there is therefore no specific treatment approach , as each person will need to be assessed individually and the treatment approach will need to be tailored to the individual needs of each client . key elements in treatment will include : engagement of clients into services retaining clients in active treatment providing interventions which facilitate motivation to change addressing the relapsing nature of a chronic condition through relapse prevention work facilitating re - integration into the community with appropriate support ( adapted from department of health 2002 ) . 4.3.4.1 assessment of dual diagnosis the aims of assessment are : to ensure that patient needs are accurately identified , thus preventing inappropriate treatment responses to obtain a comprehensive picture of needs and problems through an ongoing process which is multi - professional and multi - agency in approach . the key issues in assessment are : patients are more likely to disclose substance use , if asked . substance misuse is a predictor of poor treatment outcome . neglecting substance use / disorder or mental disorder(s ) in the course of treatment can lead to mental destabilisation and/or relapse to harmful substance use . a period of abstinence from substances of at least three to six weeks ( but often longer ) is necessary to enable an accurate diagnosis of the primary problem . it is necessary to conduct a detailed psychiatric and substance use history with corroborative information from relatives , carers , other staff / professionals , previous record / notes and supported by urine toxicology results . dual diagnosis requires assessment and observation over a period of time . accurate assessment is necessary to prevent inappropriate treatment responses . patients with mental health problems self - medicate with substances such as cocaine and amphetamines to counteract distressing extra - pyramidal side effects . patients with substance misuse problems may self - medicate in an effort to treat psychiatric symptoms , such as depression . substance misuse and mental health problems are associated with worsening of psychological and psychiatric symptoms and increased involvement in criminal behaviour . ( sources : schneider and siris 1987 ; dixon et al . 1990 ; crome 1996 ) the health advisory service ( 2001a ) recommends that : the assessment of all individuals with mental health problems in general psychiatry actively considers the potential role of substance misuse specialist substance misuse treatment providers identify and respond to problems of combined psychiatric illness and substance misuse . 4.3.4.2 risk assessment and management risk assessment is a crucial and integral element of assessment among those with co - morbidity . risk assessment with this client group is particularly important due to a number of reasons , including difficulties in engaging clients into services , disengagement form services , high suicide rates , accidental and intentional drug overdose and harm / violence to others ( department of health 1999b ; acmd 2000 ; alcohol concern and drugscope 2002 ; department of health 2002 ) . mental health professionals should be trained to recognise , assess and manage risk of substance misuse , and risk management should incorporate harm reduction advice ( health advisory services 2001a ) . 4.3.4.3 care and management care and management of this client group need to respond to the individual needs and presenting problems identified at the initial assessment and during ongoing contact with the services and ongoing assessment . clients may present with a number of different problems and needs , such as : self - medication using drugs and/or alcohol to treat psychiatric symptoms ( dixon et al . 1990 ; schneider and siris 1987 ) depression and suicidal ideation as a result of substance misuse and the associated complications . it is important to recognise that intoxication and dependence may produce psychological symptoms ( crome 1996 ) and that substance use / misuse may exacerbate or alter the course of a pre - existing mental disorder ( crome 1996 ) . the service response will depend on the presenting features , but it is important to recognise that patterns of dual diagnosis will vary in different individuals over time , and that chronic , complex needs do not remain the same . clients have a complex clinical presentation which may change over time and hence services need to ensure that ongoing assessment and care plans change according to need . the treatment of alcohol and drug misuse , including substitute medication , is in line with the department of health guidelines ( 1999b ) and research evidence ( health advisory service 2001a ) . there are a number of common features that need to be acknowledged when working with this client group . they are as follows : poor medication compliance ( pristach and smith 1990 ; lehman 1995 as cited in ley et al . 2000 ) poor compliance with treatment regimes ( ridgely et al . 1990 ; lehman 1995 as cited in ley et al . 2000 ) higher susceptibility to high - risk behaviours such as sharing injecting equipment and unsafe sexual practices ( brooner et al . 1992 ) higher rates of hostility , aggression and violence ( ridgely et al . 1990 ; wilen et al . 1993 ) in the case of homelessness people with substance misuse problems , increased vulnerability to substance misuse ( ridgely et al . 1990 ; mamodeally et al . 1999 ; lehman 1995 ) increased rates of suicidal behaviour ( ridgely et al . 1990 ; wilen et al . 1993 ; lehman 1995 as cited in ley et al . 2000 ) . the health advisory service ( 2001a ) recommends a number of key standards for dual diagnosis , these include the following for the organisation of care for those with substance misuse and mental health co - morbidity . provision should be made for patients with mental illness and drug and alcohol misuse co - morbidity as part of mainstream mental health service . service users with co - morbidity in all commissioning areas should have access to the full range of specialist substance misuse services , as well as mental health services . it is a requirement that the remit of all assertive outreach services should include working with people with co - morbidity . mental health professionals should address issues of patient motivation to seek treatment for their misuse of substances . there should be specific and explicit management procedures in place to care for and support clients with substance misuse problems . service users , carers and families are involved in service delivery . 4.3.4.4 drug use in psychiatric units the use and misuse of drugs is a growing problem for mental health services . sandford ( 1995 ) found that 68 % of 187 nurses reported illicit drug use in psychiatric units . the use of substances in the psychiatric ward can have a detrimental and potential harmful effect on the patient and can have an unsettling effect on the ward regime . in some circumstances , where the effects of intoxication or psychiatric symptoms are worsened by illicit drug use , there is a potential risk to the safety of staff , other patients and the community ( the mental health act commission 1999 ) . it is best practice to instigate prevention strategies to avoid the problems associated with drug use and mental illness . it is therefore recommended that all psychiatric units introduce a treatment contract for patients to accept as part of the admission process , by which the patient agrees not to use / misuse or hold in their possession any other drugs licit or illicit unless prescribed as part of their treatment programme . this arrangement relies on the co - operation of the patient , as such policies do not have any powers of legal enforcement . a search of a patient or their possessions and also urine toxicology without consent and without lawful authority would constitute a trespass to the person . a search would be lawful if there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that a patient was in possession of substances or articles that could be used to harm themself or others or was in possession of a controlled drug in contravention of the misuse of drugs act 1971 . if it is suspected that a patient may be under the influence of illicit drugs , the obvious dangers of such substances reacting with prescribed medication or other consequences of the drug use would justify the responsible medical officer under the common law duty of care to the patient , to carry out some investigation , such as urine toxicology . the health advisory service ( 2001a ) recommends the following in relation to drug and alcohol on hospital premises : there should be protocols in place to deal with responding to substance misuse on hospital premises . protocols and procedures to control substance misuse on hospital premises should be combined with therapeutic approaches and support . mental health staff and other employees with substance misuse problems should have access to help and support . 4.3.4.5 legal framework : mental health act the act defines mental disorder as ' mental illness , arrested or incomplete development of mind , psychopathic disorder and any other disorder or disability of mind ' ( the mental health act commission 1999 , pp . 231 - 4 ) . diagnosis of substance misuse disorder is not specified under the categories and therefore patients can not be subject to detention for treatment under the mental health act . however , the management difficulties associated with this patient group who have psychiatric co - morbidity is often associated with increased violence , non - compliance with treatment and disengagement from services . due to the nature of psychiatric co - morbidity and the relative uncertainty , these patients should be subject to the care programme approach ( cpa ) . some patients who pose a risk to themselves and others may need to be considered for the supervision register under section 117 . 4.3.5 care pathways a number of organisations and agencies will be faced with the issues of dual diagnosis , including health and social services , voluntary organisations , probation services , housing departments and police . the care and management of patients with co - morbidity therefore needs to be multidisciplinary in approach . the pathways of care will be determined by the model of care approach in a particular area , which in turn will be determined by the need . while there is some evidence on the various models of treatment , the complex nature of this patient group would suggest the need to work towards an integrated approach of all the relevant services , with one lead service co - ordinating the comprehensive care package . it is important that the care pathway addresses the key role and contribution of each local provider agency concerned . this may typically include some or all of the following , depending on the particular individual : specialist mental health provider ; drug and alcohol services ( statutory and non - statutory ) ; primary care ; more generic organisations such as homeless services or youth organisations ; and prisons ( department of health 2002 ) . it is crucial that community psychiatrists work collaboratively with substance misuse services to identify the most appropriate systems for the referral , care and management of those with mental health and substance misuse co - morbidity . the arrangements may vary from area to area , but all clients should have access to a specialist mental health assessment by a suitably qualified medical practitioner . this should be guided by good practice guidelines ( department of health 2002 ) . 4.3.5.1 treatment processes/ environment steps / stages / processes all services involved in the treatment of those with dual diagnosis need to : adopt a common language operate a common referral criteria and process be in a position to provide a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment procedure have equal access to a range of treatment modalities , including access to outreach , community treatment , home visits , outpatient treatment , inpatient treatment , and day care provision , including therapeutic interventions involve the general practitioner in the care and management of the patient and be included in all correspondence on all aspects of care . the health advisory service ( 2001a ) recommends the following : mental health services should have treatment protocols for those with alcohol and drug problems . clients with co - morbidity should have access to the range of tiers 1 to 4 substance misuse treatment interventions . combined pharmacological and psychological treatments should be provided to clients ( where appropriate ) including those who are receiving shared care between mental health services and substance misuse services . clients with co - morbidity should be given help in developing better support systems within the community . there should be clear policies for the follow - up of clients who are discharged , either planned or unplanned , from inpatient psychiatric care . clients with co - morbidity should have access to residential and community rehabilitation services that are able to meet their complex needs . 4.3.5.2 special populations the health advisory service ( 2001a ) recommends that attention is given to special populations in relation to co - morbidity . mental health services for older people should explicitly tackle the misuse of alcohol and tranquillisers . the needs of young people with co - morbidity must be addressed by child - centred services . strategies should be in place to work with homeless people in the care and management of those with mental health and substance misuse co - morbidity . commissioners and providers should ensure that all local services are able to meet the diverse needs of the local populations and that the services are accessible to black and minority ethnic groups and effective at meeting their needs . mental health professionals should consider post - traumatic stress among clients with co - morbidity and among refugees and asylum seekers in particular . the assessment and care of women should take into account gender - specific issues . the care of parents with co - morbidity needs to focus on the needs of their children , assessing the need for support and interventions to prevent harm . 4.3.5.3 staff skill mix and qualifications training and ongoing professional development is important in ensuring that staff are adequately trained to work with clients with co - morbid mental health and substance misuse problems . each local area should develop a training strategy to identify the training needs of all staff and professional groups working in statutory and non - statutory organisations ( health advisory service 2001a ; department of health , 2002 ) . mental health services should appoint staff who have formal training in mental health and substance misuse co - morbidity , or ensure that staff have access to substance misuse training once they are in post . mental health services should have a substance misuse training strategy that pertains to all staff and professional groups and which is monitored and evaluated ( health advisory service 2001a ) . for staff working within substance misuse services , training should be provided which includes the recognition and care of service users with mental illness and collaborative working with mental health services . key elements of staffing issues : substance misuse and mental health service staff need to be adequately trained to assess psychiatric co - morbidity . services need to ensure they have access to all professionals in medicine , psychology , nursing and social work to work with psychiatric co - morbidity . all staff need to have training in risk assessment . all services providing care and management to those with psychiatric co - morbidity need to have a lead medical officer with experience in substance misuse and psychiatry . all nurses within the services need to be qualified registered mental nurses ( rmn ) . all staff in general psychiatric services should have some training in substance misuse . staff involved in providing the care and management of patients with psychiatric co - morbidity should have at least 12 months ' post - qualification experience . the services involved should agree which consultant psychiatrist will act as the lead medical practitioner responsible for the care of a particular patient . training of staff should incorporate three main elements : inter - agency collaboration and information exchange through inter - agency training ; theoretical and skills - based training ; and practice development and supervision ( department of health 2002 ) . 4.3.6 outcome monitoring / procedures see ' performance and outcome monitoring ' section in chapter 4 ._. _ _ first published in new learning issue 9 , spring 2001 conversing with metaphor by penny tompkins have you ever been speaking to a student and they say , " you know , it 's like ... " ? inevitably you have , because we all use metaphors to describe our experience . whatever they put in the " ... " , will be a metaphor , and will have significant meaning for them . [ note 1 ] some teacher 's disregard student 's metaphors and consider them ' throwaway ' comments . but many teachers with exquisite rapport skills have learned to listen very carefully to their student 's metaphors so that they can converse within the logic or ' frame ' of the metaphor . these teachers intuitively know that metaphor is not an occasional foray into the world of figurative language , but the fundamental basis for everyday cognition . george lakoff and mark johnson state : in all aspects of life , ... we define our reality in terms of metaphors and then proceed to act on the basis of the metaphors . we draw inferences , set goals , make commitments , and execute plans , all on the basis of how we in part structure our experience , consciously and unconsciously , by means of metaphor . [ note 2 ] special questions are needed to explore a student 's metaphors without introducing your own . these questions are called clean language , and are designed to respect and acknowledge the student 's experience by using their exact words . recently i was working with a student who was having great difficulty trying to describe why making decisions was such a problem for her ( perhaps she could n't decide on the right words ! ) . " and , making decisions is like what ? " i enquired . she thought for a moment and replied , " you know , it 's like going to the dentist . i 'm in the waiting room and i 'm dreading going in . " to this very rich description of her experience i simply replied , " and when you 're in the dentist 's waiting room , is there anything else about dreading going in ? " ( being careful to use her exact words ) . i could tell she was deep inside her metaphor by the amount of time she took to answer and in the way she finally said , " i really need courage . " " and what kind of courage is that courage ? " was my next question . " a courage that will help me go though it rather than delay any longer . " [ note 3 ] " and when courage will help you go through it , where is that courage ? " she touched her chest with her right hand and said " inside me . " " and whereabouts inside you is that courage ? " " in my heart " i continued asking clean language questions of her metaphor so that she could further develop her resource of courage . at the end of our time together she said , " if you had told me when we started that a comment like " going to the dentist " could link so directly with my decision making , i would n't have believed it . in fact , you could n't have told me , i had to experience it for myself . " in the above example , i used five of the nine basic clean language questions [ note 4 ] : " and ... is like what ? " " and when ... is there anything else about ... ? " " and what kind of ... is that ... ? " " and when ... where is that ... ? " " and whereabouts ... ? " conversing within a student 's metaphor is the symbolic equivalent of physical matching and mirroring -- except it acknowledges the student at a higher level . rather than honouring how they move in the world , you are honouring how they give meaning to their experience . try it , and see for yourself ! notes : 1 . a simile is just a metaphor that is labelled a metaphor -- by ' like ' for example . 2 . lakoff and johnson , metaphors we live by , p.158 . 3 . notice the subtle shift in the student 's metaphor from " going to " to " going through " . 4 . for the remaining four basic questions , see the other articles on this site about symbolic modelling and david grove 's clean language . penny tompkins is an nlp psychotherapist and supervisor registered with the ukcp and certified nlp trainer . she is co - author of metaphors in mind : transformation through symbolic modelling . new learning , the journal of the nlp education network . www.new-oceans.co.uk/ednet/ other education related articles by penny tompkins ( and james lawley ) on this site : shaping an nlp training course for teachers ( interview by judy baker ) the application of metaprogrammes to the classroom symbolic modelling in education learning metaphors all information on this web site ( unless otherwise stated ) is � copyright 1997 - 2001 penny tompkins and james lawley of the developing company . all rights reserved . you may reproduce and disseminate any of our copyrighted information for personal use only providing the original source is clearly identified . if you wish to use the material for any other reason please contact : penny tompkins and james lawley @ the developing company tel / fax in uk : 0845 3 31 35 31 * international tel / fax : + 44 28 9264 1655_cd _ _ lindow man , whose 2,000-year - old body was found in a peat bog in cheshire , was the victim of a simple murder and not a ritual sacrifice , according to two academics . they say that the british museum should remove the preserved body from its galleries and erase him from the history books . the museum describes lindow man as a 25-year - old man who met an horrific and drawn - out death . his skull was smashed by blows from a heavy object , he was strangled with a cord and his throat was cut . he was allowed to bleed for a time before being placed face down in a pond in the bog . but any suggestion of ritual murder is dismissed by robert connolly , senior lecturer in physical anthropology at the university of liverpool , and ronald hutton , professor of history at the university of bristol and the author of witches , druids and king arthur . mr connolly believes that the man may have been murdered in a violent attack . � this is n't an elaborate death , � he said . � he was clubbed to death . a small group of people believe it was a ritual killing , but it makes a better story . with respect to my archaeology colleagues , they like ritual sacrifices . the museum and several other people just want it to be a ritual sacrifice . � the two men say that many of the wounds could have been inflicted during peat - cutting activities or from the man having been trampled by a horse . they argue that lindow man 's throat cartilage shows no sign of the trauma associated with strangulation and that the decorative necklace , being made of animal sinew , probably shrank in the wet so that it looks like a garrotte . mr connolly said : � we do not have evidence from this body of ritual sacrifice in iron age cheshire . we musn't write it into the books until we have evidence . that is disrupting history . that is not historical evidence . it would n't stand up in court . � lindow man was found in 1984 when workers cutting peat to be used in gardens discovered a leg . the acidic , oxygen - free conditions in the bog slowed down the rate at which the body decayed . the dispute flared up this month in the times literary supplement . defending the museum 's position , j. d. hill , an iron age curator , wrote that their interpretation was based on an assessment by iain west , the forensic science pathologist , before his death in 2001 . dr hill maintains that lindow man was strangled : � there was a loop of sinew around his neck , tied with an unusual series of knots , which was extremely tight around his neck and left a well- defined mark on the front and sides of his throat . if this had been worn as an ornament in life , it would have been very tight . it was more probably used as a garrotte . � lindow man will remain on display at the british museum . dr hill said : � even if the interpretation of a ritual killing is wrong , he 's the best - preserved prehistoric or roman britain there is . he 's an everyman from britain 's past . that 's why people find him so fascinating . � source : the times online 21/03/2004 note : why do you think lindow man ended up in the bog ?

[ no comments allowed for anonymous , please register ] re : lindow man ' was a simple murder victim ' ( score : 0 ) by anonymous on wednesday , 28 april 2004 the story of lindow man maybe andy mould had a special knack that most people do n't have . or maybe it was just a coincidence . but in 1983 and then again in 1984 , he found human remains in an english peat bog known as lindow moss . the first time , he had found the head ( mostly a skull with little skin or brain remaining ) of a woman . a year later , on august 1 , 1984 , he was working with eddie slack , placing blocks of peat onto an elevator that would transport them to a shredding mill , when he looked at one block of peat and noticed what he thought was a piece of wood embedded in it . he threw it toward eddie but it struck the ground and crumbled , revealing a human foot . without hesitation , andy reported his disturbing find , and shortly the police arrived . with andy and eddie 's help , they located the area of the bog where the foot had been found . there , on the surface , was a flap of darkened skin belonging to what was later called lindow man . they covered it with wet peat until scientists could be summoned to view the body . five days later , in the presence of several paleobotanists and a biologist , the block of peat containing lindow man was cut , placed on a sheet of plywood , and transported to a local hospital . there , the authorities attempted to date the remains . after all , no one knew if lindow man was a recent murder victim or a man from the past . as it turned out , lindow man had died between a.d. 50 and a.d. 100 . the scientists learned , when the body was examined , that the man had been murdered . they determined this by examining his body visually and then inspecting x - rays of it . at the same time , they tried to create an image of lindow man 's appearance . then they looked inside - especially at his stomach - to find more clues to the mystery of his death . step 1 : examining lindow man visually a close visual examination provided obvious clues that lindow man had been murdered . head and neck . first , he had been hit twice on the crown of his head with a blunt object , probably an ax ; he had also been struck once at the base of his skull . second , he had been strangled . around lindow man 's neck was a small rope that had been twisted tightly , closing off his windpipe and breaking two of his neck vertebrae . finally , scientists found a gash at the throat , which may indicate that his throat was cut , though some scientists think that the wound occurred naturally after his death . if indeed his throat was cut , it was probably done to drain his body of blood . hair . scientists discovered some interesting details by looking at lindow man 's hair and beard . they were surprised that he had a beard , since no other male bog body had been found with a beard ; this was clearly not common at the time he lived . scientists also learned that someone had trimmed lindow man 's hair with scissors two or three days before his death . historians and archaeologists knew that , although scissors existed in england at the time , they would have been uncommon , most likely reserved for a privileged few . was the murdered man , they wondered , a dignitary ? fingernails . scientists found that his fingernails appeared well - manicured and cared for . they wondered if this showed that he was an important member of society , who was exempt from manual labor . but as don brothwell , who studied lindow man , explained , no one really knows what the manicured fingernails of a bog person would look like , since no one has ever compared the fingernails of mummies . clothing . unfortunately , lindow man was naked , except for an arm band made of fox fur and the thin rope around his neck . without clothes , he could have been a king or a laborer . as author brothwell put it : why did he have a well - developed , but roughly trimmed , beard - unique among bog bodies - and well - kept nails ? was he an aristocrat fallen on hard times , or a high - born prisoner sacrificed to the gods ? step 2 : reconstructing lindow man read the rest of this post ...

" to develop and produce a south west watersports tourism strategy and action plan and sail south west promotion working with regional partners " why a watersports tourism strategy the main impetus for engaging watersports and tourism in a joint strategy for action has been initiated by , principally , the department for culture , media and sport , visitbritain , and south west tourism . however , the strategic context within which this strategy must fit is complex and is described in a later section . visitbritain is keen to develop greater partnership working within regions of key organisations , to the economic benefit and overall success of the tourism industry within the economy of the regions . in realising the potential in the south west of the partnership between the watersports industry and the tourism industry , visitbritain is backing south west tourism in the process of developing a strategy and action plan for regional implementation . tourism is becoming increasingly competitive not only in terms of destinations , but the range of activities available for participation whilst on holiday . the south west is well placed to be the lead region for watersports activity tourism . due not only to the extensive coastline that borders much of the region , but also due to the newly developed south west lakes trust and nationally renowned facilities such as the cotswold water park , offering many water based activities at inland water sites within the region . whilst the south west does not have an extensive canal network in comparison to other regions of england , the region 's canals still provide an additional tourism resource for inland water based holidays . in addition , the climate makes the south west more inviting for water based activities ( although modern equipment has negated this argument to a large degree ) in comparison to other regions of the uk . any watersports , in particular sailing and surfing , are traditionally linked with south west locations . there is a perfect synergy between the two industries , and it is hoped that increased communication and partnership working can help to develop the south west as lead watersports tourism destination in the uk . the regional tourist board for the south west of england_nnp _ _ services > cri -

size figures and dramatic sound effects complement audio - visual presentations showing archive footage of the war in the far east . the exhibition offers a multi - dimensional experience to create a better understanding both of the events and the extreme conditions of the conflict . the exhibition is a joint project between the burma star association ( bsa ) and the imperial war museum and has special emphasis on the burma campaign in which members of the bsa fought . the burma star association , with 17,000 members , takes its name from the medal awarded to british and commonwealth service personnel who fought in the far east theatre during the second world war . the bsa , and in particular the herts , cambs and essex borders branch have been fund - raising for many years to help finance the exhibition ._. _ _ how to use to identify the events in your area , on a certain date use any the fields above . to narrow down your search use a combination of the categories such as region and month . once you have selected an event click on ' details ' for more information , such as price and how to get there . * our online booking service for rhs educational and recreation courses and events is temporarily unavailable pending the development of an improved service . if you are an rhs affiliated society and have a gardening event you wish to add to rhs event finder , then click on this link to download an adobe acrobat pdf ( 33 kb ) of the application form rhs regional events leaflets these are available as a series of downloadable documents . to find out more click here_rb _ _ to say that the sessions are long is to call the crusades � an affray ' . to say that you do n't understand what the hell 's going on is like finding babel � a little confusing ' . here in the old world the clocks can run backwards or sideways at random , and when , on the brink of despair , your turn is called � by then you hardly recognize your name . how suddenly empty the chamber becomes , how discreet the mercedes that spirit their regretful delegations homeward . now the clocks look at you pointedly . quick ! you read to seven dead bulgarians and then they read to you , and afterwards they take you to a little place they know in a hole in the wall of the graveyard . you wake now . the plates have been cleared . your hosts , obedient to curfew , have departed . the moon waits , and down at the end of the street in its washed -

wade williams . 'cos wade , unlike his nasty alter - ego , is just about the nicest man we 've ever had the fortune of spending time with . even if he does seem to enjoy watching us squirm as we beg him to let slip secrets of season two . ff : watching this box - set has completely taken up my weekend . i stormed through them in about a day and a half ... wade williams : * laughs * that 's great . that 's commitment ! ff : there 's something so theatrical about it ; it 's like watching a really long movie . ww : right . a producer friend of mine was saying that television is now where you can take chances because it costs so much money to make movies . even to make an independent film you 're looking to raise three million bucks . that 's why these shows are coming out now like prison break which is totally different from anything you 've seen before . queer as folk ; a lot of the hbo shows . deadwood , sopranos ... ff : american television is incredibly strong at the moment . ww : yeah . that 's the place to be creative now because the studios wo n't make movies like that anymore . ff : you 've had a tremendously prolific career on tv ; how did you come to hear about prison break ? ww : like a lot of actors , i was pretty much doing whatever i could get . i 've done a lot of heavies so it 's like falling off a log for me . i know how to do it ! i have a three year - old daughter and i read it and i thought , " i 'm not sure i want to play this guy ; i 've got a daughter now and i do n't want her seeing me do someone like this . " to which my manager said , " if you do n't go up for this i 'm going to kill you . " * laughs * so i begrudgingly went in and , sure enough , i got it . ff : and upped sticks to illinois ... ww : yeah , we had to move to chicago to do it because they shoot it at joliet prison which is a real place in chicago . it was in the blues brothers movies and it was featured in the old batman tv show with adam west . it 's this beautiful old building with incredibly imposing architecture . but the move was worth it and i 'm kicking myself for thinking about the project as i was back then . it 's certainly the best thing i 've done in my career and i 've done a lot of things . this is a series regular and it 's a great bunch of people to work with . nobody 's really a " star , " which makes it a real ensemble piece . you get a chance to shine and it could n't be a better group of people to shine with . ff : bellick really does shine ! ww : * laughs * you like him ? he 's horrible is n't he ? i killed the cat , right , in the episodes on the box - set ? ff : the moment that cat appeared it was fated to die and i should have guessed it would be at bellick 's hands ! ww : * laughs * it 's good to be bad ! it 's fun playing bellick ; you get to do things you could n't do in real life , you can say things that you 'd like to say to people but you ca n't . he gives me a way to work out my i d ! ff : he seems to be after pope 's job . ww : oh yeah . he 's after anything he can get ; he 's an opportunist . ff : i 'm assuming bellick might stand to profit , in that regard , from the breakout - as a way of highlighting pope 's incompetence ... ww : who says they 're breaking out ? bellick 's not going to let them break out , do n't worry . you watch ... they may think they 're going to break out but bellick has other ideas ... ff : well i 've heard rumours . ww : oh , you 've been sneaking plot synopsis ' from the us episodes on the internet ? well i 'm not going to tell you what happens but i will say that michael scofield is going to get his ass kicked by bellick . at least that 's what bellick prays for ! * laughs * ff : judging by the fact that the final episode is called flight , i 'm assuming the break out is going to have to happen to some degree ... ww : assume away , baby ... but the great thing is ; you were talking about how you watched all those episodes in one and a half days ; that 's great . that 's the great thing about these dvds coming out . a lot of people have complained that they missed a few episodes or that it 's on at a funky time for them . this way you can watch them all in full detail at your own schedule . i had a guy today talking about being a purist ; he did n't want to start watching the movie in the middle so to speak . this way you can just sit down and watch them in one jolt just like you did . we had a friend come over from england while we were shooting . i think the first thirteen had run and like you have sky+ over here we have tivo ; we had them all on our tivo and she sat down with her coffee and doughnuts . we shuffled food into her like she was on her sickbed as she was watching these shows all the way through . she did n't get up . she came up crying a couple of times , " oh my god ! i ca n't believe what 's happening ! " then she 'd go back down and watch some more . the beauty of dvd and on demand and tivo and everything is that people can do that now . ff : it 's the best way to watch a show like this because those cliff - hangers are just absolutely evil ! ww : * laughs * and there 's no commercials too , so you do n't even have to deal with the mini cliff - hangers over the commercial breaks ! we were just in los angeles about a month ago and toyota , which is a big sponsor of the show , threw a big party where they showed the last two episodes . it was a massive party where everyone was moving around and the paparazzi were taking photographs all over the place . the episodes started and everyone just sat down and shut up , talking only in reaction to the episodes . people were jumping up screaming , " oh my god ! " i love it when that happens . i used to scream at the tv when i was a kid watching i love lucy when lucy was going to do something stupid . now it 's kinda the same thing here ; people are just totally into it . i 'd never seen anyone watch it outside of my family and to sit there and see that group of people making noises and yelling at the screen and applauding ; it 's really cool . ff : absolutely . but i notice in that answer you rather skilfully dodged my original question which was leaning to pumping you for information on season two ... ww : well i could tell you , but i 'd have to either put you in the shoe or electrocute you immediately ... * laughs * what would you like me to do ? ff : well i 've seen what bellick does to people he disagrees with ... ww : * laughs * actually bellick never does it ; it 's always somebody else . that 's what i love about bellick . i think i shoved michael once and i kicked sucre 's ass but that 's about it ... ff : the last episode i saw one of the guards was caught with a roll of bills and westmoreland 's watch . ww : right , and as he 's coming out he looks at bellick and says , " i do n't know what you 're staring at , you do it all the time , " and bellick replies , " yeah , but i 've never been caught . " ff : yeah ! that 's so evil ! ww : * laughs * he 's so horrible . it 's such fun to play the bad guy ! ff : do n't you ever get to the end of your day and think , " christ , i 've got to repent for my sins ? " ww : no , i love it - it 's great ! * laughs * although i have to say when i 'm on set and someone gets my coffee wrong or something like that i want to turn bellick on them and i have to stop myself ! i think he 's going to my head a little bit ! * laughs * ff : shoe me if you must , but i really want to know what 's in store for bellick ... ww : * laughs * i 'll save you a space . i 'm not going to tell you what happens but let me just say that bellick is going to become more obsessed getting scofield and just bringing him down ... ff : i never quite understood why he has it in for scofield so badly . ww : have you ever met somebody that just pisses you off ? * laughs * like right off the bat you 're just like , " that guy pisses me off . " he ca n't figure him out right away and that annoys the hell out of him . and then ; come to find out that he 's interested in the girl that bellick likes too . also he 's pretty and he 's smart and he 's tall . plus , he 's up to something . and bellick 's not stupid ; he knows something 's up . in a way , too , i think it 's like a sport for bellick . you know how some people just like to mess with you ? that 's kind - of bellick too . i remember i worked with a director once and he just started picking on me . i could n't understand why he was giving me such a hard time . other people that had worked with him said , " well , you 're the monkey in the barrel . he picks somebody out of every cast and just picks on them and demoralises them . " i think bellick is the same personality type where he just has to have the punching bag . it 's more than just that with scofield , though . i think there 's a certain element of just genuine disgust . * laughs * ff : after talking to you i know bellick is about as far removed from wade as it 's possible to be . do you ever worry that you 're being so nasty on screen all the time that you 're going to be nasty for the rest of your career ? ww : not really . a lot of people say that , but in my experience getting typecast is the best thing that can happen to you because then you 'll get jobs . and i like to work and i like to play bad guys . especially bad guys like bellick because he 's not just all bad . it 's pretty one dimensional to play and out - and - out bad guy . there 's more to bellick than meets the eye . but the best characters , out of all of theatre , film and television , are the bad guys . richard iii . the scotsman . look at anthony hopkins in silence of the lambs . and that 's what usually puts actors on the map ; a good bad guy . really good bad guys are brilliant ; people love them . so i do n't mind playing a bad guy and i do n't mind being typecast . as a matter of fact , that 'd be a blessing if i could get typecast as a good bad guy . * laughs * as far as prison break is concerned , full credit goes to the writers because you ca n't do anything unless it 's written well . and bellick is written very , very well . the first twelve episodes of prison break : season one are out now on dvd . user comments : post your own comments re : focus on : breaking out comment by : terihatcherfan cheers for this , joe ! i 'm a huge prison break fan and it made a great read . olly :) posted : 11/06/2006 14:50:06 post comments : you must be a registered user to comment on the films on filmfocus . registration is free and easy . click here to sign up ._. _ _ i 'm on oxygen 24/7 and am wondering if there is a way for me to fly , since the airlines wo n't allow oxygen tanks on planes for obvious reasons . i miss traveling and would go back to it if it was possible . stan de sd ... apparently delta has a new policy that lets you use certain models of approved oxygen units . check with them ... = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = onboard medical oxygen service we provide supplemental medical oxygen for a service fee on our flights ( excluding delta connection � carrier and song � flights ) with at least 48 hours advance notice . this gives us time to ship the appropriate oxygen containers to the city you 're leaving from . we ca n't use the aircraft 's emergency oxygen for medical needs . once your travel plans are confirmed , please contact reservations to request supplemental oxygen service . our medical advisory partner will then contact you by phone to gather all the necessary information to work with your personal physician . you will need to present a medical certificate from your doctor when checking in for your flight to confirm the oxygen service request and flow rate per minute in liters required . we provide oxygen for in -

makers who need to - or just want to - have internet access . the ctn emerged from an earlier european - funded project to develop telemedicine and teleworking in crete . hospitals and healthcare centres were networked , and given the importance of tourism for the island , 15 hotels were wired up . telework facilities hotels involved in the ctn range from the smaller family - run enterprise to the large luxury hotel . facilites can include : touchdown points - where users can connect their laptop computers in public areas of hotels for access by residents resort office - a hotel room doubling as a fully wired up office business centres providing high - speed access and videoconferencing also offered are virtual office support and 24-hour technical help . access speed is usually by isdn or 56 kb modem , although 2 megabit links are available in some business centres . generally people use the network for internet banking , picking up and sending email and using the internet for browsing - often to find local information or catching up on news back home . the number of requests by prospective holiday - makers for such facilities is increasing rapidly . and it 's seen as one way of giving the island some competitive advantage . this particularly applies to guests who stay on the island for longer periods , which is becoming quite common over the winter months . people are staying for perhaps 3 - 4 months over the winter to enjoy the beauty of the island , and a milder climate at a time when it 's less crowded . being able to work effectively is an important element of their choice . future plans future ideas for developing ctn include : expanding the network to include more of the islands accommodation expanding the network to bring connectivity to local small businesses setting up local telecentres or telecottages to encourage the participation of more local people . the network , then , is playing a role in the economic development of the island . it provides an additional angle to more traditional approaches to tourism , and may be the basis for more innovation to come . case study find out about one hotel 's experience of joining the crete telework network the crete telework network website can be found at www.forthnet.gr/ctn from the site you can link to the hotels and apartments that offer telework facilities and internet access . for further information about the ctn , contact : manolis stratakis forthnet sa r&d department ctn project tel : + 30 -

this worksheet looks at a variety of issues to do with income tax including income distribution , the laffer curve , and how progressive or regressive the tax system is . step 1 was also covered in worksheet 1 , so obviously you may want to look back to your answers there if you have already done it . there is also a printable version of this worksheet available for classroom or personal use with spaces to fill in the answers . step 1 - how do you rate tax ? for more details on the uk tax system , you may want to look at the explanation of income tax . different tax changes will have different effects on the economy . there are two principal ways to cut taxes - cutting tax rates or increasing personal allowances - and they will have very different effects on the level of income distribution . to show this let 's try an experiment on the virtual economy . we 're going to look at the different effects of changing tax rates and tax allowances . go to the model and try the strategies given below : first - try cutting tax by increasing the personal allowance by � 2,000 . record the results in the table below . second - try an equivalent tax cut , but this time by cutting the basic tax rate by 2 percentage points . again record the results below . tax rate cut tax allowance increase effect on : macroeconomy 2001 economic growth unemployment inflation 2002 economic growth unemployment inflation 2003 economic growth unemployment inflation microeconomy single - earner couple with two children earning � 12,000 single - earner couple with two children earning � 17,000 two - earner couple with two children earning � 50,000 in the table below , work out the percentage gain for each family for the above policies . to do this go through the following steps : multiply the weekly gain by 52 weeks to get the annual gain . then calculate how much this is as a percentage of the original income level do this for both policies family weekly gain ( � ) annual gain ( � ) weekly gain x 52 percentage gain ( % ) annual gain as % of income single earner couple with 2 children earning � 12,000 tax cut tax allowance change single earner couple with 2 children earning � 17,000 tax cut tax allowance change two earner couple with 2 children earning � 50,000 tax cut tax allowance change which group has gained the most from the tax rate cut ? which group has gained the least from the tax rate cut ? which group has gained the most from the tax allowance increase ? which group has gained the least from the tax allowance increase ? step 2 - distributing the tax cuts as we have seen in step 1 , the same tax cut given in a different way can have very different effects across the income range . if the government wanted to redistribute income from better - off taxpayers to less - well - off ones , which of the policies below would be the most effective ? try ranking them from 1 to 4 , with 1 being the best policy and 4 the worst . tax change ranking ( 1 - 4 ) cut the top rate of tax increase personal allowances increase vat cut the basic rate of tax write a short paragraph outlining your reasons for these rankings . one way to show how equally distributed the level of income is in a country is to use a lorenz curve . this shows the percentage of national income earned by the different groups in society . a typical lorenz curve is shown below . the closer the line is to the 45-degree line , the more equal the distribution of income . as the distribution of income changes , so the lorenz curve will change to reflect this . draw on the diagrams below the change you would expect in the lorenz curve for the tax changes given : 1 ... a substantial reduction in the top rate of tax 2 ... a substantial increase in the tax - free personal allowance 3 ... a significant cut in the lower rate of income tax n.b. to check what is meant by the ' lower rate of tax ' , you may want to look at the explanation of income tax . step 3 - it takes a ' gini ' to measure income distribution one problem with the lorenz curve is that it is a slightly imprecise method of measuring income distribution . just looking at a curve may give a false impression . the gini coefficient measures the ratio of the area between the lorenz curve and the 45-degree line to the whole area below the 45-degree line . if the lorenz curve was the 45-degree line , the value of the gini coefficient would be zero , but as the level of inequality grows so does the gini coefficient . in the most extreme possible scenario , the gini coefficient would be 1 . in the uk , the figure is around 0.35 , and during the 1980s it grew as the level of inequality increased . what will happen to the gini coefficient in each of the cases given in step 2 above ? tax policy gini coefficient increase or decrease ? 1 ... a substantial reduction in the top rate of tax 2 ... a substantial increase in the tax - free personal allowance 3 ... a significant cut in the lower rate of income tax step 4 - all incomes are equal - but some are more equal than others ! now see how much difference you can make with your policies . go to the virtual economy model and try out policies to try to make the income distribution in the economy more equal . to test how well your policies have worked , look at how your policies have affected the sample families in the economy . fill in the table below with the policies you used , and the effect on the families : policies used : families : effect on their income ? ( � per week ) 1 ..... unemployed couple ( 2 children ) 2 ..... single - earner couple � 12k ( 2 children ) 3 ..... two - earner couple � 50k ( 2 children ) 4 ..... pensioner couple � 7k what problems do you think that your policies might cause for the economy ? what advantages might there be to the economy of a more equal distribution of income ? what disadvantages might there be from this equality ? step 5 - progressing or regressing ? use the glossary to find out the meaning of the terms progressive tax and regressive tax . note down the meanings . are the following taxes progressive or regressive ? tax progressive or regressive ? income tax vat tax on cigarettes council tax the conservative government from 1979 to 1997 shifted the burden of taxation from direct tax to indirect tax . does this make the tax system more or less progressive ? more / less ( delete as appropriate ) what are the arguments for changing the tax system in this way ? step 6 - tax - a ' laff - er ' minute ? use the income tax theories or the glossary to find out what the laffer curve is . draw a possible laffer curve on the axes below : what is the definition of the laffer curve ? if the laffer curve does exist in the uk , what implications does this have for the government when it formulates its tax policies ?_. _ _ we would also be very interested to hear from long time harmony members with photos and stories from past years events . fundraising expenses paid and contacts provided , can you spare a few hours a week obtaining application forms and filling them in ? it is vital to our organisation 's development and expansion . do you have previous experience ? if needed training is provided via council for voluntary services and the reu . this could be a first step on the road to a new career . new trustees there are a few vacancies on the board of trustees for people willing to spend a few hours a week working from home , and part of one sunday a month at a committee meeting in slough . reasonable travel expense are paid and children can come and play with toys , read books , watch a video or go to the cinema during the meeting . resources we are looking for help with updating and distributing our resources . the distribution includes responding to requests from individuals and organisations . web site volunteers needed . have you the time and expertise to work on our web ? can you design a home page ? have you some photos and a story to tell ? would you like to have some information about you / your family put on the web ? please contact us a.s.a.p at_in _ _ an it consultant from hawkinge in kent who lost nine stone is aiming to continue his fitness regime and become one of the country 's top indoor rowers . nick gittings is 36 years old and 6 ft 5 in tall and has been working out on the concept 2 indoor rower to supplement his slimming world programme and has gone from weighing 27st 11 lb to 18st 11 lb in only 18 months . a combination of working long hours and living a sedentary lifestyle resulted in nick putting on weight . his weight steadily increased over the last 10 years until last year he realised something had to be done following the need to have a custom - made wetsuit for a scuba diving trip . " i 'd learnt to skydive when i was in the army , and wishing to try this sport again in civvy street was devastated to find that my weight was miles away from the current safety limit , " explained nick . " i then thought i 'd have a go at learning to fly but my weight and size were too much for a normal two - seater training plane . my third ambition was to learn to scuba dive but not finding a wetsuit to fit was a pretty humiliating experience . " nick 's wife was already a member of their local slimming world group and was steadily losing weight . he decided to join her but with a few apprehensions : " i was expecting to walk into the little britain � fat fighters ' sketch but luckily it was n't like that at all . " after three months of attending the classes , and losing more than a stone in weight , nick decided to start going to the gym to improve his weight loss even more . he works as an it contractor for fujitsu and luckily has a gym at his office which he 's able to visit regularly . " i spotted the concept 2 in the gym and thought i 'd have a go . once i 'd started training on it , i was hooked , " said nick . " i 'm now regularly training on the concept 2 and i 'm working on my times to hopefully become one of the best indoor rowers in the country . my personal best over 2,000 m is 6 minutes 46 seconds which puts me in the top 160 in the country for my age at the moment . i 'm going to try and beat that score at the british indoor rowing championship later this year . " i 'm even hoping to get an indoor rower for my home so i can really work on my times . by continuing my training i plan to lose another two stone and get down to my target weight of 16 stone . " i do n't think i would have lost the weight i have , and at the pace that i have , without the indoor rower . anyone who is think of losing weight should use the concept 2 , the change it brings to your life is staggering .

" can you imagine the anguish of that father ? there was a grievance between him and his son and all he wanted to do was to forgive him . of course the question was , would he come ? saturday arrived and the father went with great expectation to the newspaper building . on that saturday , 800 young men named paco showed up looking for forgiveness and love from their fathers ( in other words , jan / feb 1993 , 6 ) . we have a built in need for a father . i miss my father , even if he had a perverse sense of humor . it was the kind of humor that says , " son , hold this wire while i pull the starter on the lawnmower . " you know what happens , a jolt of electricity shoots through your arm and your elbow feels as if it will jump out of the socket . and he falls on the ground laughing . but , the story does not end there . we were working under the hood of a 1964 gmc pickup truck . the truck is not running well , so my dad does a kind of diagnostic . " son , we need to see if the engine is getting fire . hold that sparkplug wire and see if you get a spark . " well , i am smart , i remember what happened with the lawnmower . so , i use a pair of pliers . but , you know what happened ? it 's that same old feeling of electricity shooting up my arm throwing my elbow out of socket . and , of course he laughs . and i learn a lesson never to be forgotten . when you hold a live sparkplug wire , use rubber handled pliers . in spite of his sense of humor , i still miss him . he shaped my life and instilled in me a sense of who i am . we all need a father . but , i think our need for a father is more than the physical need of a provider or an emotional need of one who shapes our character and instills in us a sense of self identity . i believe there is a still deeper level where we have our greatest need for a father . however , no human father can ever meet that need . it is at the center of our soul , it is a spiritual need . we have a need for a heavenly father . god revealed himself to us as father . i think that god made us with this driving need for a father so that we may seek him . jesus makes god known to us . in the fifteenth chapter of luke , jesus said that god is like a shepherd who goes and looks for a single lost sheep . he is like a woman who searches high and low for a lost coin . but the parable that is the longest and perhaps richest tells us that god is like a father . a certain man had two sons . we need to understand that this is a family parable . it is about a family . it is about god 's people . god is not the father of mankind , he is the father of his people . so , as we begin to think of this parable , bear in mind that this is a family story . all of us have fathers . that father may be the most loving person in the world or he may have abandoned you at birth or may have been a rapist or a ship that passes in the night . but we all have a father . what kind of father is god ? is he anything like human fathers ? i call god the prodigal father . the word " prodigal " means recklessly extravagant , lavish , yielding abundantly , luxuriant . this exactly describes the father . he is a wealthy man and has more than provided for his sons . he was easy going because the youngest son felt he could go and make unreasonable demands on his father . this father is highly tolerant . if i had gone to my father and implied that i could not wait until he died so that i could have my share of the estate , he would have slapped my teeth down my throat . yet , we find no such reaction . you know he had to be deeply hurt at the rebellion of his son . yet , he gives him what he wants . occasionally , good fathers let us learn the hard way . god lets us go our way . sometimes we wrestle with life issues , we know what god wants but we also know what we want . we think we win over god . we violate our conscience and act as if god has given us his ok . in reality , god lets us go . he lets us have our way so that we may learn the lesson the hard way . but , our father not only tolerates us and lets us go , he waits for us . as we read the text , we get the impression that the father does not take his eyes off the horizon . as he works , as he tends to his flocks and to his servants , his eye is always ready to catch a glimpse of his son returning home . this tells us a lot about the heart of god . his love is intense and deep . he does not forget his children even the disobedient ones . one day the father sees the son coming home . he had been watching . he saw the dust swirling on the ancient road . it was the walk of a man beaten down by life dragging his destroyed pride behind him . he was filthy , barely clothed , and yet , his father knew him . this father takes up his robes and he runs to meet his son . this is dramatic because older men did not run , it was a matter of dignity . now we see the abounding grace of the father . at the first words of repentance , he puts his arms around him , dresses the ragged son in royal robes , and he places the ring of sonship on his finger . he quickly places shoes on his dirty , bare feet . he restores him as only a recklessly extravagant father can . he calls for the fatted calf to be killed and throws a party . some say that the father kept the fatted calf on hand because he knew his son would return . our father is full of joy and grace . the very minute that the arrogant , sinful son returns , he restores him to sonship and celebrates because his beloved has come home . that 's our god . he loves us as no one else can even when we are totally unlovable . his love sometimes means letting us go to wander into the far country so that we may learn the hard lessons . we flee his reckless extravagance thinking that over the hill , in the next town , in the next lifestyle , there is something more fulfilling , more exciting . yet he never stops loving us . he waits for us , and when we return , he is watching and meets us in great joy and celebration . he is our heavenly father . this one whom we call father , whom jesus said we can call abba father , is no less than the righteous king , the creator of the universe , the holy one . it is he who gives the sun for light by day and the moon and stars for light by night , and stirs up the sea so that its waves roar ( jeremiah 31:35 ) . he is clothed with splendor and majesty , covering himself with light as with a cloak . god stretches out the heavens like a tent curtain . he lays the beams of his upper chambers in the waters and he makes the clouds his chariot . he walks upon the wings of the wind and he makes the winds his messengers , flaming fire his ministers . he established the earth upon its foundations so that it will not totter forever and ever . our father covered the earth with the oceans as with a garment . the waters were standing above the mountains and at his rebuke they fled . at the sound of his thunder they hurried away . the mountains rose ; the valleys sank down to the place which he established for them ( psalm 104:1 - 8 ) . our god is clothed in majesty and splendor and righteous . at the very sound of his voice the earth trembles . he breaks the bow and causes war to cease . there is no one like him . he is our holy god , our creator and our lord . and he is our father , a father who waits for his children to come home . what a patient god he is ! what love and grace he shows ! how awesome is our god ! how awesome are his ways ! how awesome is our redeemer and savior ! how awesome is our father who loves us and waits for us to return !_. _ _ nino bernardo in the independent on sunday 4th july 2004 martial art : be afraid , be very afraid - it 's the key to a happy , healthy life , says this fighting man a martial art for cowards ?

" if you can be in a state of fear and be so calculating that you make the right decisions every time , then you 've got something good coming your way , " he explains . in other words fear , rather than being a negative emotion , can become the basis of intelligence . bernardo developed this philosophy through decades of studying wing chun , a chinese martial art that emphasises simplicity and effective body mechanics . the core of the system is an improvisational exercise called chi sao , which can be translated as " sticky hands " . bernardo describes chi sao as a combat - style game to be played by friends . he says one of the main aims of the game is to provide intelligent answers to stupid questions . for example , one practitioner might sense a gap in another 's guard and throw a punch . bernardo would describe this punch as a question . the other practitioner must learn how to react intelligently to the punch , for example by instinctively intercepting the punch with another , more direct , punch . practitioners learn not to flinch at each punch , but to stay within striking distance , relax and accept their fear . one consequence of learning how to play this game is that skilled practitioners become much better at defending themselves . however , bernardo calls this a side effect of learning the system , and not even the most important one at that . " it would be much more sensible to hire a bodyguard than to invest all that time and money in learning wing chun if self - defence was the only reason , " he says . " how often in your life do you have to defend yourself ? " instead of presenting wing chun as a fighting art , bernardo has come to realise that learning the system helps practitioners sharpen skills in other areas of their life , as well as improving their overall health . this insight first came to bernardo in the early 1970s when he trained with wong shun leung , a legendary hong kong street fighter and bruce lee 's principal kung fu instructor . bernardo was able to train up to seven hours a day with wong as he was working nights as a guitarist at the time . as he learned the system from wong , bernardo 's friends noticed that his guitar - playing improved . over the course of the past 20 years , bernardo has noticed the same phenomenon at work among his own students . this has been especially true of other musicians , actors , comedians , sportsmen and martial artists from other styles . bernardo says that this seems to be due to practitioners ' " attitude to learning " improving as they struggle to get to grips with the system . it is n't magic , " he says , adding that it only seems to work if a practitioner already has a high level of skill in another area . bernardo says that this process was also true of his own teacher , wong , whom he describes as " a naturally gifted fighter " . wong was able to develop his fighting skills to a remarkable level through wing chun , and always marketed the system as a counterattacking fighting art , as other practitioners still do . wong made his reputation in countless full - contact challenge fights on the rooftops of hong kong in the 1950s and 1960s . he emerged from these no - rules fights as the undefeated and undisputed champion . after retiring from challenge matches , wong continued to teach wing chun in hong kong until his death in 1997 . bernardo was one of a handful of students to learn from wong before moving to london in the late 1970s . he set up an underground , word - of - mouth kung fu school called the basement in 1984 , and then moved to ibiza in 2000 . bernardo 's latest project is an alternative wing chun school called the ibiza kwoon , which he describes as " the latest stage in my evolution " . the school has dormitories for visiting students , a training hall , attractive grounds and even a swimming pool . he teaches wing chun the same way he learnt it in hong kong , with no coloured belts , no uniforms and no salutes . all levels train together , and everyone learns from each other . bernardo also tours europe , teaching wing chun seminars and giving workshops in the network of schools that have been set up by his own students , including centres in london , oxford and reading . he comes across as far removed from the stereotype of the martial artist as humourless and remote . he cracks jokes , utters profanities , teases students and goes off on tangents as he urges newcomers and old hands alike to study the system for its own sake . bernardo begins each training session by looking at a single technique . he makes all the students , whether beginners or advanced practitioners , study it in pains - taking detail until all of them can perform the action with great precision . he then shows different applications of the technique . sometimes he goes slowly , building one technique on top of another . at other times , he rushes through a series of related techniques . bernardo also explains his philosophy and insights through jokes and stories . for example , he tells his students that it is a common myth that martial artists need to bulk up by using weights as part of their training . he jokes that a martial artist lifting weights to get big forearms is equivalent to someone bashing their fingertips with a hammer before learning the guitar . he says that wing chun practitioners develop strong muscles as a side effect of repeating the exercises , the same way a guitarist will develop hardened fingertips . bernardo 's lighthearted view is that " the more beautiful you are , the more stupid you are " , because you can only develop a honed physique through endless repetition of exercises . at his seminars bernardo tells his students not to believe a word he says , but to test everything . he says that one of the most important benefits is the way that the system teaches practitioners to think with both hemispheres of the brain in a co - ordinated way . bernardo 's background as a performer is clear as he varies the pace of his teaching and delivers one - liners with expert timing . as well as his experience as a musician , he has worked as an actor and a fight choreographer . he has also travelled the world as a sailor and speaks english , cantonese , french , spanish , portuguese and italian fluently . he switches between languages instantly as he talks to students from around the world . throughout his seminars , bernardo returns time and again to the theme of fear , which he describes as an emotion that evolved to ensure the survival of early mammals . he says that humans in many societies have somehow become ashamed of their fear . " fear is regarded as something cowardly , but every war hero who ever won the congressional medal of honor or the victoria cross or whatever was wearing brown trousers at the time , " he says . " the trick is to get scared in an intelligent way .

part 1 by james lawley " all theories of organisation and management are based on implicit images or metaphors that persuade us to see , understand , and imagine situations in partial ways . metaphors create insight . but they also distort . they have strengths . but they also have limitations . in creating ways of seeing , they create ways of not seeing . hence there can be no single theory or metaphor that gives an all - purpose point of view . there can be no ' correct theory ' for structuring everything we do . " gareth morgan 1 this is a two - part article : part 1 draws on the ideas of gareth morgan , a pioneer in the use of metaphor to read , analyse and facilitate organisations to change . part 2 shows how a new approach , symbolic modelling , uses client - generated metaphors to facilitate individuals to understand and change themselves and their organisations . symbolic modelling can be used as an alternative or as a supplement to gareth morgan 's methodology . if you are a consultant , facilitator or manager interested in organisations and how they do and do n't work , then gareth morgan 's books , images of organization and imaginization are a ' must read ' . images of organization the central thesis of this book is that all theories of organisation and management are based on implicit metaphor , and that metaphors play a paradoxical role : they are vital to understanding and highlighting certain aspects of organisations , while at the same time they restrict understanding by backgrounding or ignoring others . morgan.s theoretical stance is clearly aligned with that of linguist george lakoff and philosopher mark johnson who have done so much to raise awareness of the pervasiveness and fundamental nature of metaphor . they say , in all aspects of life ... we define our reality in terms of metaphors and then proceed to act on the basis of the metaphors . we draw inferences , set goals , make commitments , and execute plans , all on the basis of how we in part structure our experience , consciously and unconsciously , by means of metaphor . 2 take for example the the very common metaphor that an organisation is like a machine . we think in terms of ' inputs and outputs ' , maximising ' production ' and making ' efficiency the driving force ' . when things are going well we say the organisation is ' running like clockwork ' , a ' well - oiled engine ' or an ' assembly line ' . when they are not , then communication has ' broken down ' and ' things need fixing ' because there is ' a spanner in the works ' . in response we want to get to the ' nuts and bolts ' of the operation and intervene at the point of maximum ' leverage ' . we conduct ' time and motion ' studies , regard people as ' cogs in a wheel ' , and attempt to quantify and measure everything . we establish human ' resources ' departments , allocate ' manpower ' and recruit to ' fill a slot ' . and all because the organisation loves ' re - engineering ' . gareth morgan says , " one of the most basic problems of modern management is that the mechanical way of thinking is so ingrained in our everyday conception of organisations that it is often difficult to organise in any other way " . 3 to open up our thinking he seeks to do three things : ( 1 ) to show that many conventional ideas about organisation and management are based on a small number of taken - for - granted images and metaphors . ( 2 ) to explore a number of alternative metaphors to create new ways of thinking about organisation . ( 3 ) to show how metaphor can be used to analyse and diagnose problems and to improve the management and design of organisations . morgan illustrates his ideas by exploring eight archetypical metaphors of organisation : machines , organisms , brains , cultures , political systems , psychic prisons , flux and transformation , instruments of domination ( see box ) . archetypical metaphors for organisations ( and associated concepts ) machines efficiency , waste , maintenance , order , clockwork , cogs in a wheel , programmes , inputs and outputs , standardisation , production , measurement and control , design organisms living systems , environmental conditions , adaptation , life cycles , recycling , needs , homeostasis , evolution , survival of the fittest , health , illness brains learning , parallel information processing , distributed control , mindsets , intelligence , feedback , requisite variety , knowledge , networks cultures society , values , beliefs , laws , ideology , rituals , diversity , traditions , history , service , shared vision and mission , understanding , qualities , families political systems i nterests and rights , power , hidden agendas and back room deals , authority , alliances , party - line , censorship , gatekeepers , leaders , conflict management psychic prisons conscious & unconscious processes , repression & regression , ego , denial , projection , coping & defence mechanisms , pain & pleasure principle , dysfunction , workaholis flux and transformation constant change , dynamic equilibrium , flow , self - organisation , systemic wisdom , attractors , chaos , complexity , butterfly effect , emergent properties , dialectics , paradox instruments of domination alienation , repression , imposing values , compliance , charisma , maintenance of power , force , exploitation , divide and rule , discrimination , corporate interest in describing how each metaphor has been used by different organisational experts , images of organisation contains a wonderful summary of almost every management theory ever expounded . if you want an overview of taylorism and time and motion studies ; organisational needs analysis , open systems and contingency theory ; organisational ecology ; cybernetic and holographic thinking ; corporate culture ; organisations as a collection of interests , conflicts and power ; psychoanalytic theory ; self - organising systems ; marxian dialectics ; or framing and reframing , they are all in this book . the final chapter presents an example of gareth morgan 's organisational analysis applied to a small firm employing 150 people . he splits the process into two stages . first he uses each of the eight metaphors described above as a " frame " through which to view the organisation and to produce multiple " diagnostic readings " . then he engages in a " critical evaluation " of each reading to produce a " storyline " that brings them together in a meaningful way and implies a course of action . imaginization while images of organisation is highly theoretical , imaginization is devoted to the practical art of using metaphor for organisational analysis and creative management . imaginization , with its cartoons and large print , has a completely different style . throughout , the principle is : " it is impossible to develop new styles of organisation and management while continuing to think in old ways " . 4 it shows how metaphors can be applied to organisational change , resolving conflicting ideas , identifying core problems , reading and reshaping teams , creativity , and rethinking products and services . although morgan is at pains to avoid asserting the supremacy of any given metaphor or theoretical perspective , it is clear that he prefers a relativistic , self - organising approach to management . to manage multiple decentralised teams and projects , for example , he offers the metaphor of a spider plant . you can use the metaphor of a spider plant ( or any other metaphor for that matter ) in the following exercise : 5 1 . select an organisational unit for the exercise ( team , department , project , company , etc . ) . 2 . list as many of the characteristics of the spider plant as you can . ( eg . spider plants begin to grow new shoots when they outgrow their pots . as the plant reaches out to search for new ground it receives nourishment from the mother plant . when the new plant has established roots and is able to sustain itself , the linking shoot is no longer necessary . ) 3 . for each characteristic , identify where there are , and where there are not , parallels in your organisational unit . 4 . consider how well the metaphor fits your organisation , and the new insights this creates . 5 . letting your imagination run wild , ' stretch ' the metaphor of the spider plant to think about how your organisation could be . in other words , use the metaphor as the basis for a new organisational design . 6 . what are the differences between the newly designed and the existing organisation ? what new insights for shaping management processes emerge ? for example , say your reading of your current company ( step 3 ) is that " unlike a real spider plant , the only thing growing in this organisation is what 's in the pot . the central plant is being fed by the offshoots . their life is being drained away " . you might realise ( step 4 ) , " if this carries on the offshoots will die , and the central plant will suffer . in fact it has already started to wither " . the metaphor can now be used to create a new design ( step 5 ) , " if the stems of the offshoots represent the flow of resources and values , they need to be strong and healthy so that resources can flow both ways . that would encourage more offshoots rather than stifle new initiatives " . you might conclude ( step 6 ) , " we 've been so focussed on the competition between the pot and the offshoots we 've never thought of developing the stems . we could even use them to integrate the whole organisation " . conclusion images of organisation was written entirely from the consultant 's viewpoint . in imaginization , however , morgan recognises that people within organisations can describe their own metaphors and create new ones . he concludes , " the challenge facing the modern manager is to become accomplished in the art of using metaphor : to find appropriate ways of seeing , understanding , and shaping the situations with which they have to deal " . 6 this is not some ' nice to have ' tool , but an indispensable skill . whether you realise it or not , you , and everyone around you , are using metaphors all the time , and are taking decisions based on those metaphors . in part 2 of this article i introduce symbolic modelling -- an approach based entirely on facilitating clients to generate their own metaphors and make use of them to effect change in themselves and the organisations of which they are a part . references morgan , gareth , images of organisation , sage , 1986/1997 . morgan , gareth , imaginization , sage , 1997 . lakoff , george & johnson , mark , metaphors we live by , university of chicago press , 1980 . lawley , james & tompkins , penny , metaphors in mind : transformation through symbolic modelling , 2000 notes 1 p.348 , images of organisation 2 p.158 , metaphors we live by 3 p. 6 , images of organisation 4 p. 63 , imaginization 5 pp . 65 - 66 , imaginization 6 p. 348 , images of organisation effective consulting is published by pentre publications , visit www.effectiveconsulting.org.uk james lawley was a senior manager in the telecommunications industry before co - founding the developing company . now he specialises in facilitating managers and teams to develop their ability to think symbolically and systemically , and to learn from modelling themselves . with penny tompkins he is co - author of metaphors in mind : transformation through symbolic modelling available at � 17.95 ( plus p&p ) and the training video " a strange and strong sensation " available at � 25.00 ( plus p&p and vat ) . related articles by james lawley ( and penny tompkins ) available on this site : what kind of a man is david grove ?

� but in fact it 's in sweden . our ultimate destination was lake myvatn in the north of iceland . the brochure billed it as a nature break , with pictures of beautiful countryside . as i was going to a country where i had never been before , my curiosity could n't let me visit without stopping off to see reykjavik , the world 's most northerly capital , with the atlantic ocean as its coast . the first thing that strikes you is that everywhere is very clean , and the air is fresh . there is very little pollution as the country is on the mid - atlantic ridge , a volcanic area which produces geothermal heat , which is used to heat 90 % of the country 's buildings . the city is very small with only 110,000 inhabitants , and only has one main shopping street . it does , however , have a backdrop of mountains , which were tipped with snow during our visit . the most striking thing about the place is that none of the buildings are very old , with most of the houses having the air of being prefabricated . dotted around you will also see the odd sculpture as the city prides itself on the variety of cultural interests that it has to offer . after a visit , you will never again complain about the british weather . apart from it being very windy one minute , it could be snowing and then raining the next . the people there have a saying � if you do n't like the weather , just wait a minute ' as it changes so fast . one of the main attractions about the place is its restaurants . we did n't have a bad meal anywhere , although you will certainly pay london prices , with wine being perhaps even more expensive . the highlight of this area was a visit to the blue lagoon , 50 kilometres or a 40-minute drive out of town . there is a public bus service which will collect you from your hotel with the cost including your visit . the fare was around � 15.50 , with entrance to the lagoon another � 9.50 depending on the rate of exchange . even with temperatures at just a little above zero , we were able to swim outside in the geothermal seawater , which is kept at 36 � 39 � c looking up the sky through clouds of steam . its distinctive blue colour comes from the blue green algae and white silica . the latter are proven natural skin conditioners , and buckets of the silica are placed around the pool for you to smear on your face as a conditioning mask . i also had a massage , which is given to you in the open air , in a reserved part of the lagoon . with a restaurant and snack bar , our only regret was not having put aside enough time to spend there . our trip to myvatn was taken in a small plane . the airport is incredibly efficient , and although you are asked to be there half an hour before departure , people were arriving virtually up until the time we took off . the wind made the short flight rather bumpy , although in the summer there is also the option to hire a 4x4 car to make the journey , which will take you through their highlands , driving in between glaciers . lake myvatn is about an hour 's drive from akureyri , and is the most idyllic spot . the star rating in iceland is unfortunately not the same as in the uk , and although the family - run hotel , the reynihlid , where we stayed , was portrayed as four - star , it was actually a very nice , but basic family - run hotel . however , we did get to eat delicious , authentic icelandic cooking , including black bread , which had been freshly baked in the ground over night , as the temperatures near the surface are warm enough in some areas ._. _ _ mon , feb 13 , 2006 17:43 gbnf returns when gonzo returns on friday feb 24th at 7 pm for those who do nt know ... gonzo is a new music show but you guys choose one classic track to be played in each show . it does nt have to be really old but as long as its not a video we play anyway at the moment - at least a year old please . * important * please let us know why you want to see your classic video so zane can read it out stop press : gbnf will now have a second part to it . we will also show a classic clip from an old gonzo show each time as requested by you . so let us know what classic interviews / moments from the g archives you 'd like to see again and why ( could be the foos , qotsa , stripes , libertines , dimitri , malkmus , alice cooper , frank black , yeah yeah yeahs , reuben etc etc etc ) hope that makes sense choaf re : gone - zo but not forgotten freenrich thu , jun 29 , 2006 22:43 play travis - love will come through awesome song ! seems to never ever get any airtime anymore though . re : gone - zo but not forgotten stop incest ban ... country music sun , jun 25 , 2006 18:36 blur park life a m8 of mine is a oasis fan an i would really enjoy mocking him with my blurtasticness much thanks re : gone - zo but not forgotten qotsa 's groupie sat , jun 24
