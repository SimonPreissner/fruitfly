taking the guess work out of setting up your subwoofer . amplifier resulting from an extensive development program , the 120wrms dc - coupled bi - polar amplifier provides the engine to power the perfectly matched 10.5 " ultra long throw aluminium woofer . the power supply has been designed to awesome requirements . we fit a 150va double insulated toroidal transformer which has been designed specifically for this audio application . the rectifier used is a 10 amp 60v bridge version ; it , of course , never sees 10 amps or 60 volts as this would equate to 600w 's but it is just an example of how over engineered this amplifier is , and substantiates why , when deep transients are required , the amplifier has enormous reserves of power to accommodate with utter ease even the deepest of explosions . to aid this the capacitors used are the large bucket type with a ripple current of 10 amps each and selected because of their high temperature and minimal loss characteristics . the transistors used are the metal oxide semiconductor bi - polar type and specifically designed for audio applications . crossover the " reference i " has the ultimate in sophisticated crossover circuits . a digitally accurate microprocessor controlled crossover circuit ( damp ) , incorporates a digital display so that the upper response limit can be set in musically accurate variable increments between 30hz and 120hz . a " straight - through " lfe bypass facility is activated at one end of the controls travel which allows the input signal to bypass the filter circuit . the lfe bypass is used where an already filtered signal is offered to the low level input sockets . an example of this would be a sub output from a dedicated control pre - amplifier such as found in a home cinema system . there are separate gain controls for high and low level inputs , a " straight - through " lfe bypass and an audibly transparent , " automatic speaker protection " ( a.s.p. ) circuit which monitors the output stages for clipping and limits the cone movement if the amplifier is being over - driven . professional neutrik speakon connectors are standard for the " reference i 's " stereo high level input . gold - plated pins inside and an approved touch proof design to cater for potentially high voltages that can be connected to it complete the high level input socketry . the " reference i " also offers a balanced low - level xlr input and output for use with professional mixing desks and suitably equipped domestic systems . additionally , gold plated rca connectors are offered to cater for input and output . there is a relay in the signal output of the amplifier which waits for 2 - 3 seconds before it connects the loudspeaker . this allows the power supply to settle and prevents a loud thump that would occur without it . when switched off , the relay instantly disconnects the loudspeaker and allows the power supply and output transistors to discharge without noise . the amplifier panel is constructed from high grade 4 mm thick aluminium sheet and has a 0.46 � c / w heat - sink rating . additionally the bi - polar transistors are bolted to this plate to further reduce the required heat build - up as output rises . this combination enables the amplifier , even under continuous high loads to run amazingly cool during operation . as an added security measure a 90 � c thermal trip is added to the platform to prevent heat stress to components when over driven . speaker using a die - cast solid aluminium chassis of monstrous proportions creates the rigidity that is so important in sub - bass speaker requirements . any distortion of the chassis under extreme load will detract from the goal of pure sound wave formation . as we all know the creation of sound waves comes directly from the movement of the cone surface through the air . the longer the movement of the cone , termed as its excursion , the more air it moves and up goes the sound pressure level . we like to think of our 10 " driver as the best of all worlds . it has agility , rigidity and declarative damping to enable the cone to move with lightning speed back and forth through the air . incorporating an optimized linear motor with progressive suspension to avoid bottoming and allow maximum linear excursion . the result is extremely low total harmonic distortion ( thd ) . the voice coil is aluminium and bonded to the aluminium cone to form a one piece structure which is much stiffer than could be achieved from a paper version . the result is a piston like action adding to the accuracy of the wave formation . better heat dissipation and further reduced thd is achieved as a result of the rigid one piece aluminium cone structure . the massive rubber cone surround together with the semi - rigid lower damping apron serve to bring the cone to an almost instantaneous return to its resting place between transients . truly , the muscle of the system and the working end of this bass producer . d.a.m.p. d.a.m.p. ( digitally accurate microprocessor ) this digitally accurate microprocessor controlled crossover circuit ( damp ) the " reference i " has the ultimate in sophisticated crossover circuits . a digitally accurate microprocessor controlled crossover circuit ( damp ) , incorporates a digital display so that the upper response limit can be set in musically accurate variable increments between 30hz and 120hz . a " straight - through " lfe bypass facility is activated at one end of the controls travel which allows the input signal to bypass the filter circuit . a.s.p. a.s.p. ( automatic speaker protection ) this circuit monitors the output and the input of the amplifier . as the output reaches close to the limit of the power supply rails the input is instantly reduced to prevent the amplifier from clipping . the dynamic range of the amplifier is not compromised as the circuit has been set to activate at a point beyond the full dynamic range before protection is activated reference i specifications : 120watt dc - coupled bi - polar amplifier speaker and line level inputs with gain control range 80db neutrik speakon connectors ( gold plated ) ( high level 100k ohm ) ( 10mtr neutrik cable supplied ) balanced ( xlr ) connectors ( gold plated ) ( low level 10k ohm ) unbalanced rca ( phono ) connectors ( gold plated ) ( low level 10k ohm ) sophisticated crossover circuit - variable increments between 30hz and 120hz " straight - through " lfe bypass filter switch phase control infinitely adjustable between 0 � and 180 � frequency response 10hz to 120hz * a.s.p.

officers ' views projects , strategies and selected examples : a typology the " support " element of the evaluation knowledge and perceptions of community relations in the wider community footnotes references preface the centre for the study of conflict is a research centre based in the university of ulster . its main work is the promotion and encouragement of research on the community conflict and to this end it concentrates on practical issues to do with institutional and community structures and change . it publishes papers and books arising out of this work including : a series of research papers particularly designed to make available research data and reports ; a series of majority - minority reports ; and a series of occasional papers by distinguished academics in the field of conflict . it has recently published a register of research on northern ireland which has been widely praised , and a termly newsletter on current research called research briefing . this new series of six research reports and papers on aspects of the northern ireland conflict represents the results of recent work as well as a reprint of an earlier work still much in demand . it includes the extensive evaluation work of colin knox and his colleagues on the community relations and local government initiative , a major experiment in the promotion and encouragement of inter - community activity through the medium of district councils ; a ground - breaking report by valerie morgan and grace fraser ( carried out in association with the centre for research on women ) called the company we keep : women , community and organisations , on the role and influence and cross - community activities of women in small towns and rural communities ; the first in a new series of reports on the concept and experience of alienation , called protestant alienation in northern ireland ; the most recent majority - minority report ( joining earlier reports on education and on employment / unemployment ) this one by martin melaugh on housing and religion in northern ireland ; a paper by ed cairns on psychology and the northern ireland conflict , one in the series of occasional papers written by distinguished scholars . finally , a reprint of the much discussed report by duncan morrow and his colleagues on the churches and intercommunity relationships first published in 1991 . a second new series of reports will be published in july 1994 on topics such as geographical segregation , education for mutual understanding , disability , community development and peace education . seamus dunn may 1994 . return to publication contents report summary section 1 : introduction and background to the programme the report begins by setting the district council community relations programme within the more comprehensive package of measures ( targeting social need , education reforms , fair employment legislation ) designed by government to achieve greater equality and equity in northern ireland . the specifics of the programme are then described in some detail . the central community relations unit ( ccru ) invited councils in 1989 to submit proposals , which had to be agreed on a cross - party basis , for a community relations programme with the following objectives : to develop cross - community contact and co - operation ; to promote greater mutual understanding ; to increase respect for different cultural traditions . ccru offered 75 % grant aid to councils for the employment of community relations officers and the provision of such programmes . by 1993 , twenty - five of the twenty - six councils had joined the initiative with a budget of � 1.3 m ( 1992/93 ) . this report is an evaluation of the district council community relations programme which : a. provides an overview of the work undertaken by community relations officers in implementing the initiative ; b. assesses the effectiveness of the various types of community relations projects within local authorities ; c. examines awareness levels of the programme within councils , and attitudes to community relations amongst the wider community ; d. makes policy recommendations arising from the formative or process evaluation of the programme . section 2 : the policy evaluation policy evaluation is a ' critical but detached look at a programme 's objectives and how they are being met ' ( h.m. treasury , 1988 , p.1 ) . this is a deceptively simple explanation for a process which is quite difficult particularly when evaluating social programmes whose aims tend to be broad - based , as in the case of the community relations programme , and not therefore easily amenable to quantitative measures of performance . recognising that the programme is still in its formative stages the report is a process evaluation which assesses ' how a policy is put into practice , what happens on the ground , and relates this to how the policy is meant to work ' ( department of the environment , 1992 , p.6 ) . section 3 : the research design and methodology the balance of the evaluation design reflects the process orientation of the study with a major emphasis on in - depth qualitative work within local councils . this is supplemented by quantitative survey data gathered as the basis for comparison between councils participating and those not participating in the initiative . six councils were selected using a three stage procedure for in - depth qualitative work . firstly , councils which were involved in the initiative for less than one year were excluded from the selection . secondly , those remaining were stratified by their political orientation and the number of councils from each grouping calculated in proportion to size of the grouping . the final stage of selection reflected variables such as per capita spending on community relations , the catholic - protestant split , the number of community relations officers employed and whether or not the council had a community services function . the quantitative work involved a 2,000 sample postal questionnaire , adapted from the 1989 british social attitudes questionnaire ( northern ireland community relations module ) administered throughout nine council areas - the six councils selected above and three councils which ( at that stage ) had not yet joined the initiative . the study also involved a support element for those councils not directly involved in the in - depth studies . although not part of the formal evaluation this was seen as an important starting point for sharing and recording good practice work in community relations . section 4 : implementation of the community relations programme - officers ' views 1 . community relations officers the role of the community relations officer is self - directive and will depend upon support at political and official levels within councils and the extent to which they can link into a network of established community groups . accessing protestants has been problematic for community relations officers . there is a degree of suspicion on the part of protestants that community relations involves a hidden agenda and making political concessions . cross - community projects are sometimes difficult to organise in the absence of neutral venues . some community relations officers have been able to generate confidence and trust within cross - community groups which break down barriers preventing the use of venues normally associated with the other community . community relations officers expressed a mixed reaction to training received to date . trainers , in turn , have to deal with officers from a variety of backgrounds working in councils which have joined the initiative in a staggered way . the community relation forum ( a network of community relations officers ) provides support to officers and has the potential to contribute in the wider debate on the future of community relations as a council function . the opportunity to use community relations money to fund existing council projects is diminishing as community relations officers gain experience and insist on an agenda which meets the objectives of their programme . some confusion exists over the funding role of other agencies such as the community relations council ( crc ) , the central community relations unit ( ccru ) and the department of education for northern ireland ( deni ) and the potential for overlap and duplication . there is a recognition by community relations officers that the community relations programme is a long - term commitment to changing attitudes and behaviour . short - term monitoring , particularly using estimates of numbers and religious make - up of those involved in projects , may provide a narrow interpretation of activity in the short - term , but obfuscates the incremental progress towards change in the long - term . 2 . chief executives and chief officers the introduction of the community relations initiative into councils had been supported by the majority of councillors with only a small group expressing opposition or hostility . community relations issues are best dealt with in sub - committees which are conducive to informal debate rather than at full council meetings . the role of the central community relations unit in training and advice in community relations was seen as supportive , although direct links between community relations officers and ccru personnel could detract from a corporate council ownership of the function . funding of the initiative was , in general , adequate although there was criticism of the central community relations unit over final approval dates and the consequences for council budgeting . chief executives repudiated the idea that substitute funding took place . community relations officers had to fulfil four main roles : developmental : initiate contact , investigation and appraisal work usually related to existing groups ; promotional : increase public awareness through the supply of information to organisations and groups , advice , guidance and encouragement ; provider : actively involved in the actual organisation and delivery of programmes ; enabler : enable groups to generate projects themselves and take on ownership of them , leaving community relations officers to concentrate on network building , co - ordination , funding , training and disseminating models of good practice . there needs to be some check to ensure agencies ( councils , community relations council , central community relations unit ) were not duplicating funding , and co - operation between other community relations providers ( education and library boards , the youth service , belfast action teams , workers ' educational association , corrymeela and northern ireland childrens holiday scheme ) . most councillors were completely convinced of the merits of the scheme by the efforts of community relations officers who had increased their credibility and gained the respect of members . its endorsement by almost every council ; the volume of cross - community projects and activity ; its acceptance across political parties . problems identified with the scheme were : concern over long - term funding ; location of the community relations officer in the council structure ; little impact in hard - line areas ; availability of neutral venues ; monitoring catholics and protestants attending events . comments on the future development of the programme included : the scheme should continue , given the achievements to date ; councils are keen to innovate beyond ccru guidelines ; community relations officers should move to an enabling role ; funding of neutral venues is important for the future . section 5 : projects , strategies and selected examples - a typology participant observation in the six councils was used to examine the process of implementing community relations projects and assessing their relative merits . the projects were classified in a 5 part typology as follows : type 1 : high profile community relations ( big telly , cavalcade of song ) . these projects are generally one - off events aimed at promoting the community relations function through public relations . they tend to attract large numbers but are not part of a long - term developmental strategy . type 2 : inter / intra community development ( cross - community development and single identity work ) . some groups have such entrenched negative social attitudes and sectarian prejudices that intra - community development is a necessary pre - requisite for cross - community work . inter - community development builds upon a network of established groups interested in pursuing common goals which straddle the sectarian divide ( health , housing , roads , economic development ) . good community relations is an important by - product of this process . type 3 : cultural traditions ( cross - community drama groups , inter - district music twinning project ) . bringing groups together on the basis of their shared interest in similar cultural traditions ( sport , music , dancing ) provides a good medium for improving awareness and increasing understanding of diverse traditions . type 4 : focused community relations ( workers ' educational association ( wea ) , protestant and catholic encounter ( pace ) workshops ) . people can interact and co - operate on an inter - personal level while maintaining latent , but potentially volatile , negative social stereotypes of other groups . focused community relations workshops confront these attitudes and prejudices . type 5 : substitute funding ( lord mayor 's show , christmas lights ) . usually events in place prior to the community relations programme which have become part of the community relations officers ' brief . their potential for community relations is limited but officers have become more adept at insisting on a community relations agenda . several key issues emerged from the in - depth examination of the various community relations projects : a. projects are more effective if part of a community relations strategy . this is unlikely to be the case in projects undertaken with schools or youth groups which tend to be one - off and ad hoc in nature . b. good community relations work can emerge from , and contribute to an on - going community development process which addresses common concerns . focusing upon what binds communities as opposed to what divides them , provides a platform for collaborative community development work which is intrinsically good for community relations . there are considerable merits in a twin - track approach . c. there is a trade - off between high profile work , which generates good publicity for councils , and more effective focused projects which have the potential to alienate or offend councillors and officials . the programme must therefore operate at two levels . on the one hand it should ameliorate the fears , misconceptions and apprehensions of councillors and officials and on the other patiently pursue the more effective if somewhat high risk and controversial focused work . d. training is crucial for community relations officers particularly as they move more towards an enabling role in councils where networking , advising and facilitating groups to undertake community relations are the norm . information sharing through case studies of good practice is an essential part of the training process . e. monitoring statistics collated for ccru are seen by the community relations officers as synonymous with impact assessment . large numbers of participants therefore equate to effective performance . compliance with this erroneous assertion may detract from working with smaller more effective groups . f. targeting sectors of the community is important given the budget limitations . in this regard there is little reason for funding work in the school and youth sectors where other organisations ( deni education boards ) have community relations responsibilities . some points of good practice emerged from the above key issues . section 6 : support element of the evaluation the support element of the evaluation was undertaken as a discrete part of the project to provide practical support for those councils not involved in the policy evaluation . community relations officers discussed their role within the council structure / system and its implications for their work in practice . the scope and nature of community relations projects , under the banner of cultural traditions work , was examined . training and support for community relations officers were considered and some direction given on the future mode of training . four elements in the support process were examined : line management the community relations officers ' forum the central community relations unit the support offered through the evaluation process : - community relations officers were reluctant to request supervision from line managers as they were busy people , but their work would be enhanced by regular formal supervision from an appropriate informed and interested in - house manager . - there was a strong endorsement and recognition of the need for a forum from the community relations officers , although it is not as effective and supportive a mechanism as it has been in the past . this has been acted upon by the creation of regional sub - groups . - there is a perception amongst community relations officers that ccru has become too ' distant ' from the district council programme as a result of changes in personnel at both official and political levels . - external independent support is an essential way to enhance their practice . several examples of project work were cited and ideas on good practice shared between community relations officers . section 7 : knowledge and perceptions of community relations in the wider community this section reports on the empirical evidence emerging from the survey work within the nine council areas . the evidence suggests : a. awareness levels are high amongst the community about the role of councils in community relations in spite of its relative newness as a function . this is particularly the case in those areas where there is a combined community development / community relations approach . b. there is a high level of support in the community for councils spending money on community relations as a functional activity . c. data gathered from the nine councils confirm the trend of improving perceptions of community relations and a degree of optimism about the future of relationships between the two communities . d. there is evidence of more positive community relations attitudes amongst the community in councils participating in the ccru funded initiative . although a causal link can not be ascribed , given the research design limitations , there is sufficient complimentary qualitative evidence to substantiate the real contribution made by the council programme . return to publication contents findings of the evaluation objectives of the programme this evaluation has been designed as a process / formative ( as opposed to an outcome / summative ) evaluation , and hence the focus has necessarily been on how the programme is being implemented in practice and the extent to which its implementation is effective in achieving the objectives of the scheme . the three objectives of the programme are : to develop cross - community contact and co - operation ; to promote greater mutual understanding ; to increase respect for different cultural traditions . given the relatively short period of the scheme 's operation and the staggered involvement of councils in the programme , councils have focused on the first of these objectives . this objective is short - term , activity based and quantifiable through monitoring returns . the second and third objectives are concerned with long - term changes in attitudes and behaviour . the evaluation found very real achievements in attaining the first objective within district councils . because the objectives are not mutually exclusive the extent to which the remaining objectives are attained will depend upon how effective and sustainable contact and cooperation are . the second and third objectives are , therefore , influenced by the type of projects undertaken by community relations officers . this is discussed in finding two . 2 . community relations projects the evaluation identified five broad types of projects undertaken by the community relations officers : a. high profile community relations - one - off projects aimed at attracting large numbers from across the communities and useful in promoting the community relations banner ; b. inter / intra community development - projects which build upon community development issues both within and between communities , focusing on what binds communities rather than separates them ; c. cultural traditions - bringing groups together on the basis of shared interest in similar cultural traditions ( sport , music , dancing ) as a means of improving awareness and understanding of the diversity of those traditions ; d. focused community relations - small group workshops , aimed at community activists / leaders , which confront sectarian attitudes and prejudices in the community ; e. substitute funding - projects in place before the initiative commenced which are now within the brief of the community relations officer but have limited potential for community relations work . the evaluation found that inter / intra community development , cultural traditions and focused community relations were the most effective in pursuing the long - term objectives of ' promoting greater mutual understanding and increasing respect for cultural traditions ' . 3 . community development and community relations a rather false division appears to have emerged between community development and community relations work , compounded by arguments that the latter is now flavour of the month and is given preference in funding terms . the evaluation found that some of the most effective community relations work emerged through community development issues . those councils with an established community services department and access to a network of local groups have benefited to a greater extent from the new community relations function . collaboration between community development and community relations produces sustainable cross - community benefits through a twin - track approach . 4 . the role of the community relations officer the role of the community relations officer is a changing one and can be described in four ways : a. developmental : initiate contact , investigation and appraisal work usually related to existing groups ; b. promotional : increase public awareness through the supply of information to organisations and groups , advice , guidance and encouragement ; c. provider : actively involved in the actual organisation and delivery of programmes ; d. enabler : enable groups to generate projects themselves and take on ownership of them , leaving community relations officers to concentrate on network building , co - ordination , funding , training and disseminating models of good practice . the evaluation found that , given the constraints on resources ( most councils have one community relations officer ) , the most effective role for the community relations officer was that of enabler . it is recognised however that there will always be a need to develop , promote and provide community relations but their future orientation should be to facilitate and enable other individuals , groups and organisations to become involved in the delivery of community relations . the support element of the evaluation stressed the importance of a link person within ccru to liaise with community relations officers and the possibility of external support to develop dialogue on good practice . this would clearly assist community relations officers in the transition to an enabling role . 5 . issues arising from the evaluation in the course of the evaluation a number of issues emerged which have a bearing on both the short and long - term implementation of the programme : a. target groups - it would seem sensible for community relations officers to target their limited resources at sectors within the community . there must , therefore , be some doubt over community relations officers working with school children and the youth sector , given the responsibility of other government agencies for community relations work in this sector . b. grant scheme - there is some confusion over the roles of the central community relations unit , the community relations council and district councils in providing grant - aid to community groups . this confusion could give rise to duplication of funding and overlap in the work undertaken . responsibilities for funding need to be more clearly defined . c. long - term funding - in a programme which has long - term objectives , the short - term three year cycle of funding is not conducive to strategic planning in community relations work . this is also reflected in the contractual nature of the community relations officers ' employment . some commitment at government / local authority level is crucial for the medium to long - term development of the programme , building on its initial success . d. monitoring - the accuracy and value of the monitoring process have been questioned by community relations officers , given the way in which figures , of necessity , must be collated . moreover , the returns encourage the promotion of large high profile events which tend to be less effective in community relations terms . the role of monitoring needs to be clearly set out so that the confusion which exists , among community relations officers , over its purpose and the use to which monitoring information is put , can be clarified . 6 . achievements of the programme the achievements of the community relations programme are significant , some of the more important are : a. the endorsement of the programme and its objectives across the political parties by 25 out of 26 local authorities ; b. the increasing enthusiasm with which councillors and officials embrace community relations as an important function of the local authority ; c. the range and effectiveness of projects undertaken by community relations officers which encourage contact , cooperation , mutual understanding and respect for different cultural traditions ; d. the growing confidence with which community relations officers undertake a sensitive task , sometimes in difficult circumstances , and their increasing credibility as professionals ; e. the improving community relations trend , evidenced in both the evaluation data and the social attitudes survey , in which the district council programme plays an important part . return to publication contents introduction and background to the programme introduction there is a recognition on the part of the united kingdom government that the seemingly intractable problems of northern ireland are best dealt with on a number of political , social and economic fronts . juxtaposed with , and in support of , such measures are initiatives aimed at tackling underlying community divisions . the government therefore places considerable importance in developing good community relations defined as " bringing two sides of northern ireland 's community towards greater understanding " ( central community relations unit , 1992 , p.1 ) . a major initiative , launched in 1989 , provided financial support for community relations programmes developed by local district councils which could command cross - party support from the constitutional parties . twenty - five of the 26 councils are now involved in the community relations initiative which , at the outset , received funding for three years , but has subsequently been extended by the same period . a condition of the funding for the programme entailed routine monitoring of activity indicators such as the type of community relations schemes undertaken , the numbers of people involved and an evaluation of the programme 's effectiveness in meeting its objectives . this report is an evaluation of the district council community relations programme and sets out to : a. describe , in detail , the objectives of the district council programme and the evaluation process ( sections one and two ) ; b. consider the research design options available to the evaluation research team , the problems involved in measurement and the approach adopted in this study ( section three ) ; c. provide an overview of the work currently undertaken by the community relations officers and their experience of the programme in action ( section four ) ; d. examine the views of other council officials ( chief executives and chief officers ) charged with responsibility for the programme ( section four ) ; e. describe in detail the types of project undertaken by local authorities and assess their effectiveness against the initiative ( section five ) ; f. report details of the support given to councils as part of the evaluation package ( section six ) ; g. record awareness levels of the programme amongst the wider community , and attitudes to community relations in councils participating in the scheme compared with those not participating ( section seven ) . the district council programme - its background the district council community relations programme must be set within the wider context of a major thrust by government " to bring about equality , to promote reconciliation and mutual respect for the separate traditions and cultures which exist within northern ireland , and to create a community which accommodates peoples ' differing beliefs , aspiration and traditions " ( central community relations unit , 1992 , p.1 ) . a clear manifestation of government intent in this regard was the establishment in september 1987 of the central community relations unit ( ccru ) , reporting directly to the head of the northern ireland civil service on all aspects of relations between the two traditions . the unit was charged with " formulating , reviewing and challenging policy throughout the government system with the aim of improving community relations " ( central community relations unit , 1992 , p.2 ) . the unit was also responsible for developing new ideas which would improve relations , and supporting ongoing efforts aimed at prejudice reduction . in short , community relations became a significant feature at the heart of the government 's decision making process . government policy for community relations is therefore designed : to ensure that everyone enjoys equality of opportunity and equity of treatment ; to increase the level of cross - community contact ; to encourage greater mutual understanding and respect for the different cultures and traditions . a number of initiatives followed which addressed this policy in a variety of ways . equality and equity measures included the targeting social need initiative , aimed at reducing social and economic differentials in the community . this included schemes such as making belfast work , the derry and rural development initiatives . the pace of fair employment reform also accelerated with the fair employment ( northern ireland ) act 1989 which strengthened previous legislation by establishing two new enforcement bodies , the fair employment commission ( replacing the agency ) and the fair employment tribunal . a cross - community contact scheme , administered by the department of education , was introduced to establish and develop contact between schools , youth and community groups . this paralleled educational reforms in schools where two cross - curricular themes , education for mutual understanding ( emu ) and cultural heritage , became intrinsic to teaching a range of school subjects under the common curriculum . a cultural traditions programme was also established to support the arts , museums and irish language groups in a way which encouraged respect for the richness and diversity of shared cultural heritage . alongside these initiatives a new independent voluntary body , the northern ireland community relations council ( crc ) , was set up in 1990 to promote better community relations and the recognition of cultural diversity in northern ireland . crc provides a forum for community relations issues , is committed to development and training work with individuals and groups involved in community relations and is a grant - aiding body which resources groups working in the field ( crc 's strategy for 1991 - 94 ) . such a cursory overview of community relations ' initiatives does not do justice to the detail of the programmes or bodies involved . it is not , however , the intention to describe the work of the community relations policy network , interesting though that would be , but to locate the district council programme in the context of a range of other initiatives with similar objectives ( knox & hughes . 1993a ) on 15 june 1989 the central community relations unit invited local authorities to submit proposals for action to improve community relations in their district areas . the timing of the initiative was apt . local government elections had taken place in may of the same year following a turbulent period of opposition to the 1985 anglo - irish agreement . a number of unionist councils adjourned business and refused to strike district rates . in the wake of a number of legal rebukes , court fines and resolve on the part of government not to concede , the adjournment policy diminished and unionist councils drifted back to normal business . the 1989 elections witnessed a movement away from the extremes on both the unionist and nationalist sides ( knox , 1990 ) . the democratic unionist party 's vote dropped by 5.6 % and sinn f � in 's by 0.6 % , and the ensuing round of elections for chairmen in the newly formed councils indicated a spirit of cooperation . eight local authorities ( armagh , derry , down , dungannon , fermanagh , limavady , newry & mourne and omagh ) appointed mayors / chairmen and deputies from councillors with opposing traditions and de facto power sharing evolved although the term responsibility sharing has been used in deference to the sensibilities of unionists . councillors also mounted cross - party opposition to the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering , which they saw as a threat to jobs in local councils and an erosion of the role of local government . the requirements of contracting - out services produced unanimity of purpose amongst all councils to vigorously compete for the right to provide existing functions . a window of opportunity opened , heralding a spirit of co - operation in local authorities . this was the context within which the community relations initiative in local government was launched . ccru invited councils to participate in the community relations programme with the following objectives : to develop cross - community contact and co - operation ; to promote greater mutual understanding ; to increase respect for different cultural traditions . these objectives are crucial to the monitoring and evaluation exercise as they are the outputs / outcomes against which the success of the district council community relations programme is measured . ccru offered 75 % grant aid for the employment of community relations staff by councils , the provision of financial support for appropriate cross - community activities and assistance with the development of local heritage and cultural activities . a budget of � 279,000 was provided for the programme by ccru in 1990/91 , increasing to � 1 m in 1991/92 and � 1.3 m in 1992/93 . the specific conditions laid down for participation were : councils had to agree on a cross - party basis to participation in the scheme ; councils had to draw up a community relations policy statement ; the policy statement and individual projects undertaken had to be agreed on a cross - party basis ; community relations officers had to be appointed to administer the scheme and their post advertised under this title ; projects had to include cross - community contact , mutual understanding or cultural diversity the political parties expressed mixed reactions to the principles underpinning the programme . the sdlp argued that the absence of trust was at heart of northern irelands problems and any improvement in community relations would come only when trust was restored . sinn f � in had an ambivalent attitude in which they sought reconciliation through constructive dialogue and debate , but claimed that this could not take place until the unionist majority veto in the six counties was removed . the alliance party fully endorsed constructive community relations work designed to promote understanding and trust between the two communities . responses from the two unionist parties ranged from qualified support in the case of the ulster unionist party ( uup ) to opposition on the part of the democratic unionist party ( dup ) . whilst the uup supported schemes to encourage the affirmation and exploration of local regional identities , it claimed that an undue emphasis on commonalities could be as misleading as the picture of a culturally polarised community . the dup saw the promotion of good community relations as no more than a political gimmick by government ministers , in which public money was squandered on over - rated reconciliation schemes . good community relations for them was the elimination of terrorism ( crc , 1992 ) . the unionist position is best described by a parliamentary question posed by an ulster unionist mp : i pay tribute to the work that the minister has done on community relations , and it is valuable work but does he agree with me that we must not fall into the trap of thinking that community relations programmes can solve the problems in northern ireland ? ... does the minister agree that the best thing that can be done to improve community relations is to defeat terrorism ? ( trimble , hansard . 11 july 1991 ) . the minister responsible responded by agreeing with the premise of the first question : there is no sense in which success in community relations terms alone will resolve the fundamental and deep - seated problems that affect the community in northern ireland . there is also no doubt that the winning of the battle against terrorism will play a significant role in easing community tensions ... there is none the less , an important role for a community relations programme , and the programme is commanding greater and wider support in the province with every passing year ( mawhinney , hansard , 11 july 1991 ) . the first council to join the scheme was dungannon in february 1990 , and by the end of that year twelve councils had entered the programme . eight further councils joined the scheme in 1991 , three in 1992 and two in 1993 . as yet north down , the only remaining local authority , has not become involved . the community relations council recently welcomed the fact that most district councils were now involved in the initiative : this has been a very positive development , particularly since it has been preceded by the establishment of cross - community consensus among the elected representatives of the councils involved ( crc , 1992 ) . cross - community consensus was certainly a pre - requisite for councils ' involvement in the community relations programme . this is not to suggest , however , that council chambers are devoid of the occasional partisan fracas ! return to publication contents � centre for the study of conflict and the author(s ) last modified by martin melaugh : back to the top of this page_nn _ _ bolivia shifts left january 12 2006 which effect will evo morales ' victory have on the working class and the political landscape in south america ?

"_'' _ _ a dash from diamond city george manville fenn | next chapter | | previous chapter | | contents | chapter xxxix . anson in a hole -- and something else . " do n't worry about the diamond charge ! " said the commandant ; but oliver west did , day after day , though he got better fast and was soon able to go and sit with ingleborough , who slowly recovered , as a man does who has had nearly all the life - blood drained from his body . west worried , and ingle borough did too ; for those were anxious days , those in kimberley , which brought strong men low , even near to despair , while the wounded , weak , and sick were often ready to think that relief would never come . west and ingleborough recovered from their wounds only gradually , to suffer with the rest , returning to duty when really unfit , while the deadly work went on , the men braving the shell and shot with more spirit when they knew that the women and children were safe within the mines . then came the day of relief , and with it the feeling that a long night of misery and despair had ended ; and that night west and ingleborough grasped hands , the former 's pale sallow face lighting up with something of his old look , as he exclaimed : " now , if the general would only march in with his prisoners , and bring anson before us face to face ! " everything , the proverb says , comes to the man who waits , and certainly it was so here , for the day did come when the general rode in at the head of his dashing cavalry brigade , and , what was more , with the prisoners , and with them anson , very much reduced in weight . there was something more than mere eagerness to be freed from an accusation which led the two young men down to the general 's camp next morning to wait until they could see him in their turn . on their way they sought out the sergeant who had had anson under his charge , and he grinned at them in recognition . " you were about right , gentlemen , " he said , " about that prisoner . " " what about him ? " said west eagerly . " about his being an englishman . i 've seen a lot of him along with the other prisoners , and he 's as english as can be . piet retif ! why , he 's got james anson written on the tails of his shirts -- that is , what he 's got left . " " but look here , sergeant , " said ingleborough anxiously : " what about his wagon ? " " oh , that 's all right , sir ! loaded up . " " has he had the run of it ? " " not he , sir . he wanted to , but i only let him get some under - toggery , shirts and such . i could n't refuse him that ! " " did he go alone ? " " yes , sir . " " quite ? " " well , not quite , sir , because i was with him . " " hah ! " sighed ingleborough , in a tone full of relief . " i 've stuck to him , by the general 's orders , ever since . like a leech , sir , " said the sergeant , in conclusion--"like a leech . " the cavalry general welcomed the young men warmly , and , as it happened , the same four officers were with him , ready to join in the greeting . " i never expected to see you two fellows again , " said one of them , laughing . " i was out with my men when you were cut off . why , you must have had a very narrow escape ! " " of course , " said the general , laughing ; " but that has been the fashion : we have all had narrow escapes . well , you got safely in with your despatch ? " " we got in with our despatch , sir ! " said west rather grimly , " but not safely ; " and he briefly told their adventures . " bravo ! well done ! " was chorussed . " why , you two will have to join the regulars ! " said the general . " we ca n't have men like you for volunteers ! think it over , and , if you decide to join , come to me , and i 'll see what i can do ! now then , do n't want to be rude ; but i have no time for ordinary visitors . you sent word in that you wanted to see me on important business . what is it ? " " you speak , " said ingleborough , and west began . " we want to know about the prisoner taken that day , sir -- the man who said he was a boer . " " i remember , " cried the general . " i have him safe . " " when is he to be tried , sir ? " " ca n't say ; he will be handed over to the authorities who see to such things now . you said he was a renegade who had joined the boers . " " yes , sir , after being charged with illicit - diamond - dealing with the kaffirs working at the great kimberley mines ; and we want you to give orders for the wagon he had with him to be searched . " " his wagon searched ? " cried the general . " how am i to know which wagon he had ? " " the sergeant knows where it is , sir , " replied west ; " and we could recognise it directly . " " but why do you want it searched -- what for ? " " for diamonds , sir , that he brought away from kimberley , and which you have brought back . " " h'm ! diamonds , eh ? this sounds interesting ! " said the general . " you think he has some there ? " " we both believe he has , sir , and of great value . " " what do you say , gentlemen ? " " oh , let 's have the search made by all means ! " cried one of the officers , laughing . " it may mean salvage and loot , and all sorts of good things ! " " very well ! take the matter up , and i 'll see the search made ! let the prisoner be present , of course . i 'll be ready in half - an - hour . " punctually to the minute the general was ready , and he walked down through the temporary camp to where the wagon stood among scores of others , while the sergeant and four men stood by with anson , who looked shifty and uncomfortable , wincing suddenly as he caught sight of west and ingleborough , and then gazing sharply about at the mounted lancers on duty as patrols , for the prisoners were many , and there had been several attempts at escape . the general looked at him sharply , and then at the wagon . " is that your wagon , prisoner ? " " it was till you took it ! " replied the young man surlily . " what do you say , sergeant ? " " yes , sir , " answered the sergeant , with military brevity . " i marked it with my knife the day that it was taken . " as he spoke he laid a finger upon a couple of notches he had made in the wood - work . " now then , " said the general , " before i have the wagon examined-- " anson 's eyes twitched . " repeat the charge you made against this man ! " continued the general . ingleborough now firmly repeated almost word for word what he had before said , and charged anson with being an illicit - diamond - dealer . " and upon what do you base this charge ? " said the general sternly . " the personal knowledge of myself and friend here , " replied ingleborough . " all lies , general , " cried anson excitedly . " those two are charging me with what they did themselves . they were illicit - diamond - dealers , and when they were found out they tried to plant the crime on me . all lies ! " " crime ? yes , " said the general thoughtfully . " yes ; i suppose it is one of the greatest crimes that a man can commit in kimberley . all lies , eh ! well , sir , not all , for it is evident from your speech that you are an englishman and not a boer . i judge too that you were in the company 's office at kimberley . " " oh yes , general , " said anson ; " that is true , and through the plotting of these two men i was turned out of my situation . " " and then deserted to the boers ? " " no , general . i was obliged to do something for a living , so i bought a wagon to go in for trade ; but i was captured by the boers and they have kept me a prisoner ever since . then you fought the boers and beat them , and took me prisoner again . that 's why i 'm here . " " an englishman -- prisoner to your own countrymen ? why did you not declare what you were ? what did he say his name was , sergeant ? " " said he was a boer and his name was piet retif , sir , " said the sergeant , with a look of disgust at anson 's fat face . " yes ; that looks black against him ! " said the general . " he is taken with the boers , while those who charge him are men of trust , being chosen to bear despatches . " " because they were not found out , sir ! " cried anson . " there never was a worse pair of cheats and tricksters . " " perhaps not ! " said the general . " so you were a prisoner with the boers , my man ? " " yes , general , and very glad to see the british troops come up and gain such a success . " " you said that you was a dealer in mealies and corn , " growled the sergeant . " well , a man must do something for his living . " " of course , " said the general . " well , you look simple and innocent enough . " " i am , sir , really ! " cried anson . " and never engaged in illicit - diamond - dealing ? " " me , sir ? never , " cried anson virtuously . " i was only charged by those two to save themselves ! then they got on , and i was trampled down . " " and joined the boers out of revenge , eh ? " " no , sir : it was all fate and accident . " " well , fate is very unkind to us sometimes , my man , " said the general . " that is your wagon and span of oxen , you say ? " " yes , sir . " " well , you have prospered by your change . what did you say you traded in ? " " provender , sir -- mealies and corn . " " and you ? " cried the general , turning sharply to west . " what do you think he deals in ? " " i believe he deals in diamonds , sir , " replied west . " why ? " said the general . " for one reason , sir , because my friend , in whom i have perfect faith , caught him in the act . " " yes : anything more ? " " i know him to be a cowardly liar , sir , and-- " " oh ! " groaned anson . " i never heard anything like it . " " go on , " said the general . " lastly , sir , because he set it about that i had volunteered to carry a despatch to mafeking so as to get away with the diamonds i had smuggled . " " and did you ? " said the general . " i got away to mafeking with the despatch ! " said west , smiling . " and where are the diamonds in question ? " " my friend and i believe that they are in james anson 's wagon , " said west bitterly , for he felt bitter then against the traitor , whose proceedings he recalled when they were prisoners . later on he felt a little sorry for his words . " oh ! " cried anson , throwing up his hands and looking appealingly at the general , who fixed him with his eyes . " well , " he said ; " what have you to say to this ? " " it 's abominable , sir -- it 's atrocious -- it 's cruel ! " " then you have no smuggled diamonds with you ? " " no , sir , " cried anson excitedly . " they charged me once before , and had my wagon searched by the police . " " and did the police find any ? " " no , sir , not one ! it was a blind , sir , so that they might carry off theirs by throwing the police off the scent . i 'll be bound to say they have a lot with them now ! " " well , i doubt that ! " said the general , smiling . " where would they carry them ? " " oh , sir , you do n't know what artful tricks are played ! " said anson eagerly . " oh , i 've heard of a few since i came to south africa ; but i do n't think it likely that a couple of despatch - riders would carry many illicit - diamonds with them ! " " have the butts of their revolvers examined , sir , and the stuffing of their saddles , " cried anson . " i have heard of the butts of rifles being bored to hold a lot . " " so have i ! " said the general ; " but i fancy a wagon would be more likely to supply hiding - places ! " " oh yes , sir , but the police inspector searched my wagon , and did not find any . " " you would have no objection , of course , being perfectly innocent , " said the general , " to some of my men searching your wagon ? " " of course , i should n't like it , sir , but-- " " but ? ah , you mean conquest gives me the right of search ? " " it 's like casting a slur on a man 's character , sir . " " but it makes it shine out the brighter when you are proved to be innocent ! here , sergeant , this case begins to be interesting ! search our friend 's wagon . " anson tried to master a wince , and merely shrugged his shoulders , standing with his hands in his pockets while the sergeant and his men commenced their task , examining every part of the wagon while the officers waited patiently , lighting up and smoking their cigars until the sergeant came back to make his report . " well , what have you found ? " " nothing but these , sir , " replied the sergeant stiffly . " tucked away behind the doubled tilt they were , sir , " and the man held out a revolver , anson 's sword - stick , and his little mahogany flute - case . " humph ! no diamonds , sergeant ? " " not so much as a pin or ring , sir , " replied the man . " are these yours , mr. piet retif ? " said the general . " the walking - stick and the flute - case are mine , " said anson coolly . " the pistol must be the driver 's . i had a rifle ; but your men took that away . " " nothing else ? " said the general . " nothing else , sir . we looked everywhere , " replied the sergeant , and he offered his superior the objects he had brought ; but the general shrugged his shoulders and looked at his officers , who each examined the revolver , stick , and flute - case , and passed them back to the sergeant . " well , gentlemen , " said the general , turning to west and ingleborough : " you hear . what have you to say now ? " " the prisoner owned to these things being his ! " said ingleborough . " no , i did n't ! " said anson sharply . " revolver is n't mine . " " only lent to you , perhaps , " said ingleborough , taking the weapon from the sergeant 's hands and cocking it , making anson wince . " i 'm not going to fire , " said ingleborough , smiling contemptuously , as he held the pistol in both hands with his thumb - nails together on the top of the butt . then , pressing the cock sidewise , the butt opened from end to end upon a concealed hinge , showing that it was perfectly hollowed out and that half - a - dozen large diamonds lay within , closely packed in cotton wool . anson turned clay - coloured . " ' tisn't mine ! " he cried . " i know nothing about it ! " " well , never mind , " said the general ; " it is ours now . an interesting bit of loot , gentlemen ! " there was a murmur of voices at this , and as soon as the pistol had been handed round the butt was closed with a sharp snap , and the general turned to ingleborough again . " well , sir , " he said : " is that all ? " " i am not sure , " replied ingleborough ; " but i am suspicious about that stick . " " you think it is hollowed out ? " " yes , sir , " said ingleborough , and , taking it in his hands , he drew it apart , dragging into the light from its sheath a handsome damascened three - edged blade , which he held against the cane , proving that the blade went right down to the ferrule at the end . " what about the handle ? " said one of the officers eagerly , as ingleborough thrust back the blade into its cane sheath . " that is what i suspect ! " said ingleborough , and he carefully examined the silver - gilt tip , but twisted and turned it in vain , for there seemed to be no way of opening it , till all at once he tried to twist the sheath portion beneath the double ring which divided hilt from sheath , when the handle turned for about half - an - inch and was then drawn off , disclosing a hollow shell lining which held another deposit of diamonds packed in cotton wool . " more loot , gentlemen ! " said the general , smiling . " what comes next ? " " the flute , " cried two voices together , and ingleborough opened the case , showing the three joints fitting tightly in the velvet - lined compartments . " a silent musical instrument ! " said the general , smiling . " can anyone play the overture to the crown diamonds ? " said one of the aides - de - camp merrily . " this is the overture ! " said another , and ingleborough took out two joints in turn , perfectly empty , fitted them together , and then took out the top joint , to put that in its proper position , before raising the instrument to his lips and running up and down the gamut . " nothing there , " said the general . but ingleborough lowered the flute , held it in both hands , and drew it apart at the tuning - slide , held it sidewise , and then unscrewed the top plug , showing an opening , out of which he shook a magnificent gem of great size and perfect make . " bravo ! " cried the general excitedly . and then : " i 'm afraid , mr. dealer in mealies and corn , the judgment will go dead against you . have you done ? " he continued , turning to ingleborough . " not quite , sir ! " replied the latter . " come , west , do n't let me get all the credit for unmasking the scoundrel . " " look here , " cried anson viciously , " i protest against being called a scoundrel ! those are my private savings , invested in what were bought honestly . " " i think , sir , you had better keep your tongue silent until we have quite done ! " said the general . then , turning to the two young men , he bade them go on . " come , west , " said ingleborough , " you suspect where our friend who is no scoundrel has hidden more diamonds , do you not ? " " well , yes , " said west , rather unwillingly , for the whole business disgusted him . " speak out , then ! i am sure it is in the same place as i think he has more plunder ; but you shall have your turn now . " " no , no ; go on , " said west warmly . " if you suspect that there is some place unsearched , " said the general sternly , " speak out , sir . " " then i believe , sir , " said west , " that if the water - cask that is slung under the wagon is opened you will find a number of diamonds hidden there ! " there was a burst of excitement at this , everyone present speaking save the sergeant , who did a bit of pantomime which meant : " of course ! " for he bent down and gave his leg a sounding slap . " yes , " said ingleborough ; " that is where i meant . " " why , i thought o ' that once , " cried the sergeant , " and then i says to myself : ' that 's too stoopid a place ; no one would hide diamonds where they 're sure to be found ' ; but i crept underneath on my hands and knees and gave it a swing so as to make the water wash about inside . that satisfied me , and i came away . " " you have hit the mark , mr. west , " said the general , smiling . " there is no doubt about it ! look at the prisoner 's face ! " anson tried hard to pull it back into its normal shape , for he had been gazing at west with a malignant look that meant anything from a rifle - shot to a stab with a bayonet . " now , sergeant , see if you can do better this time ! " cried the general , as anson 's mouth shut with a click . then he stood fast with his brow wrinkled and his hands clenched , waiting expectantly with the rest of those present until the cask was set free from the raw - hide reins by which it was slung under the hind part of the wagon , and then rolled out , giving forth the regular hollow sound of a barrel half - full of liquid . " only sounds like water ! " muttered the sergeant , and he set it running , to soak into the dry ground , and draining out as much as he could , before giving an order to the nearest man to take hold of one end while he raised the other , both men looking stern and severe in the extreme . then together they gave the cask a lusty shake , and the sound which followed was that of some shovels full of pebbles rattling in the inside . the next minute they had set the cask down on end with a grin of delight , which was taken up by their fellows , while a satisfied smile dawned upon the faces of the aides - de - camp . " here , stop that fellow ! " shouted one of the officers , for , in spite of his heaviness , anson proved that he could be active enough upon occasion , and this was one ; for , seizing his opportunity , he dived under the wagon , and by the time the soldiers had run round to the other side he was off , dodging in and out among the wagons in the mad idea that he could escape ; but before he had gone a hundred yards he came out suddenly upon a mounted man , and the next instant he went sprawling over a lance - shaft , and the steel - shod butt end was planted upon his back to keep him from rising . " pity you should have taken all that trouble ! " said the sergeant , as he came panting up , followed by his men , " because we might want you to tell us all a bit about the value of them stones ! now then , up with you . let him get up , lancer ! and see here , my lad , if you cut and run again -- being a prisoner caught in the act of trying to escape -- my men have orders to fire , and you 're so broad and fat that they are sure to bring you down first shot . " anson glared at the men 's rifles and fixed bayonets , but he said nothing , marching back between the men to the spot where he had left the general and his old fellow - clerks ; but the barrel had been carried to a place of safety , and those who had witnessed his discomfiture had gone . half - an - hour later he had been marched out of the camp , and was under lock and key in the military prison , a sentry being posted at the door . | next chapter | | previous chapter | | contents | e - books created from nineteenth century or early twentieth century texts by athelstane e - texts ._. _ _ second chance pc 's new mac upgrades web store . full compatibility information , and online sales , of a great range of upgrades for macintosh computers . want a piece of computer hardware ? or need spares / repairs for your old mac or pc ? we have spares for powerbook duos , 180s , 540c , g3 , g4 , and all desktop machines from classics onward . all pc spares in stock - motherboards , ram , processors 386 upwards please ring / email our team for details . we supply a full range of cabling to connect pcs & mac 's to the widest range of peripherals and each other . with our low postage charges from � 2 p & p why pay more ? we offer on - site installation , servicing and repairs . even if you have n't bought the machine from us ! customers in the cambridge area can bring their machines to our cambridge repair centre . we offer , servicing of old machines , pc and mac health checks and repairs for any machine regardless of age or type our experts are trained to help you with all aspects of computers . we also offer service contracts / maintenance for your office lan or computers . we have many contracts already with companies and schools across east anglia please check out our corporate services page or our education page for more details . please click on the links for more information on the service of your choice . if you want to contact us for more details on any aspect of our services , please email us or call on 01223 833 412_cd _ _ posted : mon may 29 , 2006 8:55 am post subject : mandatory draft bill snuck in - to be debated on 6 - 6 - 6 former cia analyst says iran strike set for june or july : http://www.warwithoutend.co.uk/zone0/viewtopic.php?t=53639 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- looks like the us government is even looking into getting a military draft into place ( especially for when the middle east explodes after iran is bombed for israel as well ) : mandatory draft bill snuck in - to be debated 6 - 6 - 6 6 - 4 - 6 on february 14 , 2006 , congressman charles rangel ( democrat - ny ) introduced a bill ( universal national service act of 2006 - hr 4752 ih ) aiming at drafting everyone - men and women alike - from the ages of 18 to 42 into the military for a minimum period of 2 years . or to quote the bill : " to provide for the common defense by requiring all persons in the united states , including women , between the ages of 18 and 42 to perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security , and for other purposes .

grade mineral or linseed oil , or thoroughly coat them with warm petroleum jelly . the treatments reduce the irritation , soften the scales and promote healing . it has also been suggested that the " oiling " seals the scales and forces the mites to come to the surface to breathe . the treatment must be applied to the entire affected area daily for at least 2 weeks or until normal appearance of the legs and feet returns . after letting the treatment soften the dead scales , gentle scraping or rubbing will help remove the dead scales and mites . northern mite darkened feathers due to a heavy infestation in the vent area of birds , but can not always apparent on small birds . the mites are irritating to people and sometimes cause dermatitis , they have been shown capable of persisting in the absence of a host for up to six weeks , although most starve within about three weeks . infestation seems to concentrate about the vent , although some birds suffer from a general distribution of mites all over the body high infestation levels have been shown to reduce egg production in otherwise healthy hens by 10 % . severe anemia may result in birds infested with large mite populations . death is usually the result of blood loss from 20,000 or more mites per bird . adult female northern fowl mites lay their eggs on the host bird . these eggs hatch in a couple of days , depending on temperature and humidity . the larva which hatches from the egg does not feed but , within a day , molts to the nymphal stage . the nymph has biting mouthparts , which pierce the host 's skin to obtain a blood meal . after feeding on the host for 4 - 7 days , the nymph matures to an adult . the adult mites feed on blood , as well . after mating , the female can produce eggs within a couple of days . although she lays only a few eggs ( 2 - 5 ) , a substantial mite population can develop rapidly , due to the short generation time . depending on temperature and humidity , the life cycle can go from egg to egg - laying adult female in just a week . theoretically under ideal conditions and with no mortality , a population of only ten mites on a bird could explode to over a billion mites in just ten weeks . this emphasizes the potential for development of a severe northern fowl mite problem in a very short time . mites are frequently transmitted from bird to bird by contact or by crawling onto new hosts from secluded places in the environment ._. _ _ to celebrate bristol ’s rivers , the bristol living rivers project , in partnership with bristol ’s community groups has planned a series of river walks in bristol this summer . come and discover our hidden rivers and streams , spot kingfishers along the riverbanks , listen to commentaries and short talks about the history of our waterways , whilst getting some exercise at the same time . maps : environment and planning interactive maps household waste centres planning applications recycling centres latest environment and planning news community clean up in redcliffe ( 22 jun 2006 ) 80 % decrease in smoking related litter ( 22 jun 2006 ) council laboratory opens doors to students ( 22 jun 2006 ) smoking related litter decreases by 80 % ( 22 jun 2006 )_-rrb- _ _ we held a series of stakeholder workshops and meetings from march to may 2005 . on the basis of comments and suggestions made at these meetings we prepared a draft vision which we tested with stakeholders at a conference on 15 june . full reports from each workshop are attached in the links below . 10 march 2005 workshop organised by the national trust for representatives of wider social and economic interests report [ 16 kb ] 29 april 2005 government organisations involved in managing the natural environment and delivering natural environment policy report [ 30 kb ] 4 may 2005 other interested parties report [ 23 kb ] 25 may 2005 small open forum with business ( we have also discussed our work with business at a corporate responsibility group meeting on 27 july . )_-rrb- _ _ on the lower slopes of the hills north - east of the village is a spring called lady well on the ordnance survey , and so presumably dedicated to the virgin . the well - head is completely overgrown with brambles , and may conceal some architectural fragments . beaminster st mary 's well lies part - way down a lane from the parish church of st mary . all that remains on the site is a squat black pump that has no reputation and is n't used . the name occurs in 17th century documents . bothenhampton ' on the walditch side of bridport ' there was an east - running spring ' from which people fetch water for their eyes ' ( recorded in 1893 ) . broadway in the 1820s a spring in a field by the roadside at nottington got a reputation as a spa . the documentation on the site is fairly good , because the spring soon became one of the stopping - off points for visitors to weymouth going on excursions . there is a chemical analysis of the waters , which apparently tells us more about the state of chemical knowledge at that time than it does about the spring ; and two sketches of the site exist , forming a before - and - after pair . the earlier one depicts a crude stone wall suitable for a cattle trough , and the description attached tells how gentlefolk visiting the well would be startled to find that scabby cattle and mangy dogs had been brought in the hopes of sharing a cure . in the second , all this has been swept away and replaced by a neat octagonal building of two stories , more like a folly than anything else , with a weathervane in the form of an heraldic pelican . this survives ( sans pelican ) as a dwelling house . burton bradstock two or three fields on the tithe map have names incorporating the words holy well . as i remember , the well ought to lie at the corner of the adjacent fields . cerne abbas ( st austin 's well ) the site known as st augustine 's well was originally the silver well . here st edwold , a member of the mercian royal family who left his native land to become a holy man , lived until his death in 671 , in a small hermitage . ( thus william of malmesbury ) . cerne abbey was founded in the 970s , although they may have chosen the site because of its association with the saint of an earlier century . edwold was told in a vision to travel to silver well ; when he came to cerne , he gave silver pennies to a shepherd in return for bread and water , and the man showed him the well , which he recognised as fulfilling the vision . later , in the 11th century , the monks of cerne felt a desire for a more exalted origin , and hired an itinerant hagiographer called gotselin to provide it . he composed a new legend ascribing the well to st augustine . the saint was travelling in dorset when he encountered some shepherds ; he asked them what they would prefer to drink , beer or water , and when the temperate shepherds asked for water , he struck the ground with his staff and created the spring . or , while in a vision he struck the ground to make the spring run out , crying ' cerno el ' , which is latin and hebrew for ' i see god ' and forms a pun on the village 's old name of cernel . the legend goes on to describe an adventure of augustine with the folk of an outlying village who tied fishtails onto his robes ; this is taken from a canterbury story . the well has had a triple reputation , as being an oracular , a healing , and a wishing well . ' if anyone looks into st austin 's well the first thing on easter morning he will see the faces of those who will die within the year ' ( 1897 ) . this story is now told , at cerne as at elsewhere , of waiting in the parish church . the well ' works wondrous cures . i have had a case told in all detail while sketching the lovely spring ' ( 1888 ) . it was prescribed for sore eyes and general ill health ( 1897 ) . it was thought wholesome to plunge new - born babies into the chill water , ' the infant being dipped just at the time when the sun first begins to shine on the water ' ( 1893 ) . but the sun would have to penetrate the leaves of several well - grown trees . a newspaper columnist in 1850 alludes coyly to the local belief that women drinking at the well would become pregnant . presumably the use of the spring as a wishing - well to gain husbands is part of the same belief . girls were to drink from the water , put their hand on part of the fabric known as the wishing stone , and pray to st catherine for a husband . in another version , the spring is a wishing - well pure and simple ; you are to make a cup from laurel leaves , fill it with the water and face south to the church , then drink it while you wish ( both traditions 1957 ) . these beliefs are tangled up with the custom of praying to st catherine for a husband , which was practised at the site of her lost chapel south of the village on a hill , and with the practice of invoking the cerne giant to cure sterility : giant hill lies just over a field from the well . this site is the only holy well in dorset to have had a shrine ; leland records that there was a chapel to st augustine built over the spring . this seems to have been demolished and replaced by some simple but beautiful stone channels which surround the spring 's breaking - point and lead it to the south . a few stones beside the well - one of them presumably the wishing stone - have come from the ruins of cerne abbey ; one of them bears a tudor rose , and so must date from the last great phase of re - building . the well lies in a hollow , four or five feet below the level of the surrounding field ( the parish graveyard ) . it is surrounded by lime trees , known in the village as the twelve apostles . cerne abbas ( pill well ) this lies on the outskirts of the village and was reported in 1897 to share in the curative powers of st austin 's well . corfe castle three sites in this parish are connected with the history or legend of st edward , king and martyr ; they are known as st edward 's bridge , cottage and fountain , and have been so called since the time of hutchins the county historian ( 1774 ) . the well is mentioned in a reference of 1429 to ' a stream of water at seint edwardiswateryng ' . the king was out hunting near corfe in 978 when he was betrayed and murdered by servants at the instigation of his step - mother elfthryth , who wished that her son ethelred would become king . after the crime , edward 's body was taken to the cottage of an old blind woman nearby . at midnight the cottage was filled with a mysterious light , and the woman 's sight was restored . elfthryth ordered the body to be thrown into a well , but a year later a pillar of fire descended from heaven upon the well , and the body was taken out and found to be uncorrupted ; the water of the well afterwards cured diseases . the saint 's body was taken to wareham , and thence to shaftesbury . ( thus the hagiographers . the miracle stories are amongst the later additions to the legend ) . in modern times the water of the spring was prescribed for eye trouble and the ague ( 1978 ) . cranborne a hamlet of this parish is called holwell , and in the 1950s a stone monument was placed by a spring here with an inscription identifying it as the eponymous holy well of holwell . the epns for dorset , however , derive the first element from holh , ' hollow ' but only give one form . in the 1890s a local antiquary traced the remains of a villa near the well . east stoke holy well , holy stream running from it , and holly wood through which the stream runs , all appear on the ordnance survey . evershot a crossroads here , at the junction of three parishes , is called holywell after a well dedicated to st john . none of the three adjoining parish churches is dedicated to that saint . fifehead neville a writer describing the roman villa here in 1903 states , ' the meadow immediately north - west of the villa is called holywell meadow , and still contains on its brow a strong clear stream of warm water . i have found that the flow is received into a stone basin of unknown age , with grooving for a sluice and hatch for regulating the supply ' . fontmell magna the site of the former crown inn is now occupied by a potter 's workshop within which ' is a deep well containing , if you have the requisite ailment , healing waters which you may freely imbibe ' ( 1978 ) . hazelbury bryan the tithe map of 1838 shows a holly well . the name appears as hallwell mead in 1607 . hermitage so named from a succession of hermits established on this land , a detached member of the royal manor of fordington , since the 14th century . a spring called lady 's well lies near the church , which is dedicated to the virgin , and a place nearby is called remedy on the 1811 o.s. holwell a parish which until the present century lay in somerset , though entirely surrounded by dorset , an oddity probably due to monastic ownership . the name is firmly derived from holh by fagersten in his dorset placenames , but i have met with other forms where the element is clearly halig ( holy ) . at any rate , a well with steps leading down to it is shown by the villagers as the eponymous holy well . ibberton a spring formerly called stachy 's well is now a damp patch of nettles . hutchins derives the name from st eustachius ' well , the church being dedicated to that saint . it is possible that the church dedication is a back - formation based on antiquarian speculation about the well name . lyme regis there is a st andrew 's well , lying beside st andrew 's chapel in the town , and described as ' one of the earliest and best sources of lyme 's water supply ' : it is named in the mediaeval records of the borough . portesham a charter of 1024 includes ' the holy well ' amongst its bounds . these run along a stream in the valley bottom for this part of their course . and the site of the well can only be approximately made out . portland the district here named fortuneswell was first so called in 1608 . the name presumably commemorates a wishing - well of some sort . purse caundle there is an old well behind the hall of the manor house , standing by a newel staircase , and ' a fairy , or undine , lived at the bottom ' . the staircase was destroyed in the 19th century because the family grew tired of seeing the apparition on the stairs . the well was supposed to contain treasure . when it was cleared out , some medicine bottles were found in it , presumably having been used in conjunction with healing water ( 1928 ) . radipole the hamlet of holwell in this parish appears as a manor called halegewelle in domesday . at a later date , this parish , like nottington in broadway , had a spa ; but i am not sure where it stood . sherborne at the northern edge of the town , beside a pub called the traveller 's rest , is st winifred 's well . the name may be modern as it has not been tracked down in any mediaeval documents . symondsbury ' water from a spring which rises facing due east is said to be a cure for sore eyes , especially if the water be taken at the moment the sun 's rays first light upon it . a spring rising in a field at symondsbury farm has this reputation ' ( 1892 ) . ' in 1913 the water from this spring had been diverted to a trough , or tank , lower down in the field , and no longer flows out facing the east ' . upwey the hamlet of elwell in this parish is helewill in 1212 , and is derived by the eps from haele , ' safe ' , haelu , ' health ' , or hael , ' omen ' - so that it was either an oracular or a healing well . in recent times it was known as the healing well , ' a spring in a field at the bottom of ridgeway , behind where the royal oak inn used to stand ... healing properties , especially in connection with eyes , were attributed to this spring . ' the upwey wishing well is the source of the river wey , and the most powerful spring in the south of england . its reputation as a wishing - well is reckoned locally to have begun with its use as such in a novel early this century , and the prescribed ritual - to take a cup or laurel - leaf full of the water , drink , and throw it backwards over your shoulder while wishing - may have been borrowed from cerne and elsewhere . in any case , the tea - rooms at the well are a fascinating gallery of folkloristic kitsch - plastic gnomes and lucky horseshoes etc . wareham a spring beside all hallows chapel is referred to as alhalon well in 1545 and allhollan well in 1582 . whitchurch canonicorum st wite , to whom the church is dedicated , has been the source of frequent controversy ; some have dismissed her as a back - formation from a name white - church , others have claimed her as a celtic saint gwen , and a third party hold that she was a 9th century english hermitess . her relics were found during the restoration of the church , within a 14th century casket . the most recent authorities have favoured the theory of a local english saint . st wite 's well has been in existence since 1630 , when a traveller refers to ' st white a virgin martyr , whose well the inhabitants will shewe you not farre off in the side of an hill , where she lived in prayer and contemplation ' . this well is marked on the ordnance survey and there have been recent attempts by some rich eccentric to build a shrine over it . some possible patron wells there are some instances of wells lying in or by a churchyard , which doubtless served the liturgical needs of the church and may have borne a dedication to the patron saint . these are at lyme regis , where a well by the former chapel of st mary and the holy spirit ( now a public garden ) is known as the lepers ' well : at mappowder where an unfailing sprint rising behind the church is known as morning well ; at plush , a chapelry in piddletrenthide , where a spring takes its rise just below the chapel ; and at stalbridge , where leland wrote that there was a spring walled about on the south side of the church . some wells with associated folklore ashmore there is a well here , with an ash tree growing above it , called washers pit . two stories are connected with it , one telling of a white lady who haunts the well and the nearby road , and the other recounting how the cook from the big house had a prophetic dream and rode out to this spot , coming in time to save a lady dressed in white who was hanging from the ash tree . evershot a well here is supposed to be covered with oil at certain times , and there are traditions of roman occupation in the area . loders a white lady haunts a cottage with a well in the garden here . powerstock there is a well here whose water runs red at certain times , because an unfaithful wife was once thrown in and drowned in its waters by her jealous husband ; it is either her blood that stains the water , or the red dye of her petticoat . at another well here , a man drawing water had a fleeting thought of making the pact with the devil . the devil appeared , to ask the man if he meant to do it or not ; he answered that he must finish drawing water first , but the devil pushed a burning candle into the water of the well , and as soon as it was extinguished , made off with the man 's soul . shaftesbury because this town stands on a hill , it always had in the past to get its water supply carried up in carts . ( there was more beer than water in shaftesbury then ) . the water came from some springs at a place called enmore green in the neighbouring parish of motcombe . from the 17th century onwards , there was a yearly ceremony by which the mayor and corporation of the town went down to the village , feasted and danced , and handed over a peculiar object called the shaftesbury bezant , all in recognition of motcombe 's right to the water supply . no proper history of the custom has yet been written , and the wells only appear in it as a prosaic water supply . spetisbury a field called bannell meadow is named from a spring called baunwell in 1460 , ' the slayer 's spring ' . the same etymology applies to banwell in somerset and some other places , but no satisfactory explanation of it has been founded . it may possibly allude to a dragon legend , since wells have featured in these from the 14th century onwards , but this is only a guess . steeple there is a spring called bridewell recorded on the 1811 o.s. assuming that this is not a transferred name from the london prison , it may refer to some sort of fertility or marriage superstition here , as at cerne ; but this is only more guesswork . ( it is also worth noting that there is a st catherine 's well down one of the streets of the l8th century model village at milton abbas . )_-rrb- _ _ the anglo saxons originally came to britain when they were invited to settle in kent by king vortigern in return for their help in defending britain after the romans left . the saxons soon spread northwards . by 642ad they had captured din eidyn ( edinburgh ) and stirling in scotland . lothene ( lothian ) remained a mainly saxon area even after the vikings settled in the west of scotland . the house shown opposite is built of wooden plank walls and a thatched roof . it has a pit under its floorboards which could be used as a cellar . there is also a window which is closed by a single shutter . this picture shows some metal working tools . charcoal is made by burning wood slowly in a covered pit . this charcoal burns at a higher temperature than wood and can be used for melting metals such as pewter for casting . it can also be used to heat iron up to red heat so that it can be shaped by a blacksmith . bellows made of wood and leather were used to blow air into a charcoal fire to increase the temperature . many of the tools the saxons used in metal working are similar to those used today . the early anglo saxons wore mainly woolen and linen clothes . the basic garment was a t - tunic with narrow sleeves . the wrists of the tunic might be fastened with a hook and eye or laced in to be particularly tight fitting . click here to see pattern for t - tunic men wore the tunic shorter , with trousers underneath . women wore the tunic as a longer dress and covered it with a sleeveless peplos dress , made by gathering a tube of material up at the shoulders with brooches . there is some evidence from later in the medieval period that women would have worn trousers under their dresses too , perhaps in colder weather . clothing might be decorated with braid or embroidery . the pole lathe shown opposite was used in the same way as a modern wood lathe . cutting was performed using a separate blade held in the hand . the saxons made cups , bowls , plates , spoons and many other items on lathes like this . domestic items were also made of pottery , which was baked around a fire to harden it . livestock such as the pigs shown opposite wandered freely in the village and probably took shelter in the surrounding forest at night . hens roosted in trees . the animals would eat the scraps of food discarded by the human population . they would only be deliberately fed in order to fatten them up just before they were killed to be eaten . these pictures were taken at west stow anglo saxon village near bury st edmonds in england . the village is run by the west stow trust . more pictures bibliography " anglo saxon england " -

being . this purpose is realised through a partnership between patient and doctor , one based on mutual respect , individual responsibility and appropriate accountability . in their day - to - day practice doctors are committed to : integrity compassion altruism continuous improvement excellence working in partnership with members of the wider healthcare team . these values , which underpin the science and practice of medicine , form the basis for a moral contract between the medical profession and society . each party has a duty to work to strengthen the system of healthcare on which our collective human dignity depends " . one of the most important questions raised in discussion was whether the department of health wanted doctors to act as professionals or merely to have a defined set of competencies . our responsibility is to ensure that the former view prevails . how about mcmaster ? at the end of october i visited st. joseph 's hospital in hamilton , ontario to give talks to the departments of psychiatry and of medicine . irene turpie and her colleagues told me that they were very keen to offer a fellowship to uk trainees who wanted to spend some time training or undertaking research in canada . mcmaster is famous for its early introduction of problem based learning and its emphasis on evidence - based medicine . specialist training in these areas can be offered as well as an opportunity to enrol on the masters programme there . incidentally , they too have problems with the geriatric medicine and psychiatry liaison . i had to give grand rounds twice -- medicine had theirs at 8 and psychiatry at 9 ... and could either one of them alter their times ? more on clinical excellence awards by the time you read this , the list of bgs nominations for national clinical excellence awards for england and wales is likely to have been submitted . the forms this year have been changed with candidates now being required to provide a job plan and indicate whether they are receiving extra payments . additionally extra security measures have been introduced as the process is now entirely electronic . comments have been received by members who have not been successful in achieving a nomination from the society and the nomination group will reflect on these during the year . congratulations to all those who were successful in the 2005 round . role models in academic medicine finally , congratulations are in order - first to simon conroy and marion mcmurdo on being named as academic role models by the bma . they are amongst 29 individuals chosen from over 100 nominations . secondly , our congratulations and good wishes to john gladman , our new professor of geriatric medicine ._. _ _ while it is part of zdnet 's mission to help our readers with information about technology , we are not able to offer technical support . if you have a particular problem then the best approach is send an email to mailroomuk@zdnet.com . and , if it has wider implications for other readers , then we may be able to take up your cause on your behalf . press releases do not send press releases through the post . email them to mailroomuk@zdnet.com or to the relevant editor or reporter as plain text , with no attachments . edit fax number : + 44 ( 0)207 903 6763 edit email contact : firstname.lastname@zdnet.co.uk_nnp _ _ emotional healing in minutes valerie & paul lynch conquer your fears , phobias and negative emotions with this simple proven technique . the emotional freedom technique ( eft ) is a psychological version of acupressure , incorporating methods from ancient chinese medicine and modern -

off action , and the opposition therefore failed on that ground . opposition under section 5(2 ) also failed , the hearing officer finding briefly that the opponent came nowhere near supporting its claim that its mark was well known in the uk . result : sections 5(2)(b ) and 56 : - opposition failed . sections 5(4)(a ) : - opposition failed . points of interest 1 . goodwill produced in uk from retailing activity abroad - observed that if every overseas retail outlet visited by uk residents acquired goodwill in the uk ( with associated passing - off rights ) in respect of the same or similar names , it would soon become hard to find a mark which could lawfully be used in the uk , at least for consumer goods .

" thanks to a winning combination of knowing , multi - levelled writing and perfectly cast vocal performances from an experienced and talented cast , this latter day entry into the ever - expanding field of high quality children 's tv animation , has , since 1991 , given us the world as seen from the all - accepting innocence of a child's - eye point of view . nappy wearing toddler tommy pickles is the central character of this adventurous infant ensemble . along with fuzzy - haired , perpetually scared friend chuckie , and twins phil and lil , tommy shares a playpen and endless adventures crawling around the house and neighbourhood , while indulging in a non - stop series of adventures which deftly parodies everyday life with the wide - eyed innocence of childhood , which belies the decidedly wry , adult sensibilities which informs the show 's scripting . to the rugrats , the world is a place full of mysteries ; such ordinary sights as a garbage truck chewing up refuse in the early morning effortlessly transforms in to a terrifying monster on the street outside , as their rich and active imaginations reworks the world around them into a frame of reference which they can readily grasp , if only imperfectly understand . of course , there 's a truly wonderful master - villain in the form of angelica , tommy 's malevolent three - year - old cousin who constantly delights in terrorising the mini quartet with all the gleefully open cruelty that is such a naturally accepted part of childhood . angelica is a masterful creation ; a pint - sized wicked witch of the west with a post - modern hard - nosed la attitude still being shaped by exposure to all pervading outside social influences , of which she is n't even aware , much less can she comprehend . smart , consistently funny , with a warm heart and a genuine sense of affection for the many small sorrows and joys which comprise childhood , rugrats is that all too rare event ; a children 's animated series that appeals to adults by cocking a sophisticated snook at grown up conventions , while reminding us of all that we lost when we made the transition from little to large . trivia : david doyle , the voice of grandpa played bosley in the tv series charlie 's angels christine cavanagh also voiced the pig in the move babe character voices tommy e.g. daily | angelica cheryl chase | phil / lil kathy souci | chuckie christine cavanagh | grandpa david doyle created by : arlene klasky , gabor csupo , paul germain . directors inc : jim duffy , howard e. baker , rich bugental . writers inc : john swartzwelder . theme : alf clausen . ongoing since 1995 . us nickleodeon . return to top of page_nnp _ _ i have recently bought the holle follow - on formula on goat 's milk basis but ca n't find it on your website anymore . why did you stop selling it ? on the 7th february 2006 the food standard agency ( fda ) informed us that goats ' milk based infant formulas should no longer be sold as currently marketed . this decision was made due to the efsa ( european food safety authority ) view " that there are insufficient data to establish the suitability of goats ' milk protein as a protein source in infant formula " . therefore we had to withdraw the product from our shop page . the statement regarding the assessment can be downloaded from the website of the panel on dietetic products , nutrition and allergies www.efsa.eu.int/science/nda/nda should you wish to make a complaint as a concerned parent towards the decision made by the fsa please write to : nutrition division food standard agency aviation house- 125 kingsway london wc2b 6nh can infant formula milk provide all proteins , fat , vitamins , minerals , etc . similar to those in breast milk ? breastfeeding provides your baby with the best start in life . breast milk contains all the nutrients your baby needs in the right proportion ; it contains antibodies which help your baby to build up resistance to infections like coughs or colds . your baby may be less likely to develop allergies if breast fed and therefore breast milk is the best source of nutrition for healthy babies . infant formulas must provide energy , fat , protein , carbohydrate , vitamins , minerals and trace elements . all levels of each nutrient provided are specified by law . vitamins , minerals and trace elements are added to infant formulas during manufacture to meet the infant 's nutritional needs in order to comply with legal requirements . why is infant formula milk modified ? mature breast milk contains about 7 % carbohydrate which is present as lactose . in infant formulas the carbohydrate level of cow 's milk is adjusted to match that of breast milk . the milk sugar , lactose and sometimes other approved carbohydrate sources are used for this purpose . vitamins , minerals and trace elements are added to infant formulas during manufacture to meet the infant 's nutritional needs in order to comply with legal requirements . because of their iron content follow - on milks are an appropriate alternative to whole cows ' milk . why is sunflower oil added to infant formula ? essential fatty acids can not be formed by humans . we must take them up with our food . unsaturated essential fatty acids are linol acid and linolen acid which are contained in considerable quantities in sea - fish , vegetable oil or sunflower oil . why do i need to wait 4 to 6 months before introducing new foods ? first , the baby 's stomach is not ready to digest food before this time . and second , the infants have an " extrusion reflex " which means that they instinctively push their tongues out when they are given foods - it will take time for them to lose this " extrusion reflex . " your baby will show signs when he / she is ready to begin with solids and juices , such as curiosity about the foods you eat and frequent crying between feedings . what is demeter � biodynamic ? demeter is the brand for products from biodynamic � agriculture . demeter is the only ecological association that has built up a network of individually certified organisations world - wide . demeter - international represents around 3.000 demeter producers in nearly 40 countries . today , demeter is a leader of biodynamic certification and awareness , investing in and activating self - sustaining resources that make an impact on farm communities and the consumers they serve . rudolf steiner , the founder of anthroposophy , saw a correlation between science , nature , universal laws and spiritual concerns . gravitational laws , found by isaac newton , prove that the tide is affected by the gravitational pull of the moon . this affects the water content of the soil , creates more moisture in the soil at the time of the new and full moon . seeds start to sprout and grow because of the increased moisture . a healthy environment is established when the land is worked with an understanding of the interaction of nature , universe and man . much skill is required on the part of the farmer / gardener to create a self - contained farm and garden . the ideal set - up is a mixed farm and garden with livestock and fodder crops , producing its own manure for the soil . all different ' organs ' such as fields , the animals , meadows interrelate and should not produce more than what is needed by the other ' organs ' except for human consumption . artificial fertilizers or bought - in feed , which not belong in this organism , is not introduced in the farm and garden . these ' organs ' look after the unit as a whole . this means a farm should not have more cattle than it can support itself and whose manure it can use on its own fields and meadows . conversely , only as many crops will be grown as can be fertilized by naturally produced fertilizers . all together there is an increasingly higher demand to strengthen and restore the soil and plants . preparations which are used in biodynamic farming are comparable to the effect of a homeopathic remedy and ensure that life and astral forces have better access to the whole land , farm and animal husbandry . demeter is the trademark of biodynamic standards ensuring the highest quality produce and is recognised worldwide ._. _ _ gloucester crush french resistance another french side failed to respond to the challenge of this european cup competition as the cherry and whites brushed aside a once mighty brive side with consummate ease to run in seven tries to add to the earlier ten try demolitions of toulon in previous fixtures . clearly there is little appetite or interest for the second - tier of european rugby in france and not much more outside , therefore a thorough overhaul of the heineken cup qualification criteria must now be an absolute top priority for the organisers . too many french sides are more concerned with their domestic league competition and too many celtic clubs are included at top level . great trips for supporters away from kingsholm but all too often poor rugby on offer . after a particularly depressing period of results for gloucester at kingsholm it was good to win but on reflection , although there were some positives to be taken from this game , there was not too much to get excited about , especially considering the level of opposition . gloucester 's youngsters were again to the fore with an encouraging display from an assured fly - half ryan lamb whose confident distribution won him plenty of admirers but like too many of his team mates , his kicking game was less impressive . lamb had the ideal start with a simple penalty close to the posts before james forrester demonstrated his skills with a brace of tries to ease the home side into a 17 point lead . the frenchmen did mange a couple of successful penalty kicks through maxime petitjean but that was the only time they involved the scoreboard during the first half as peter richards and mike tindall added tries for gloucester . a score of 27 - 6 at half - time underlined the home side 's supremacy and it was very much more of the same in the second period as richards got his second try , before andy hazell and james simpson - daniel kept the score moving along with further tries to finish gloucester 's scoring . brive were rarely in serious contention but did get a late consolation converted try through yves donguy . after the week 's worries concerning front row selection , both patrice collazo and gary powell were fit enough to start with jack forster on the bench among the replacements . peter richards had a better game for gloucester , as did tins and he put in some storming runs only to lose the ball in contact a couple of times but did score thanks to an unselfish inside pass from winger sinbad . sinbad moved into the centre in the second half to replace anthony allen , as james bailey , haydn thomas luke narraway , adam eustace and ludo all came on late in the game . a decent afternoon for the cherry and whites without too much trouble to earn home advantage semi - final against worcester with the possibility of heineken cup rugby still alive for next season . this particular form of european competition lacks the intensity of the premiership and is but a side -

" david grove 1 we published our first article on david grove 's clean language , less is more , in 1997 . 2 since then our model of clean language has undergone two revisions . below we document these changes and explain why they happened . by charting the development of our thinking we demonstrate how modelling over the long - term is an evolutionary process . where did clean language come from ? david grove originated clean language in early 1980 's . he noticed that his psychotherapy clients often used metaphors to describe their most traumatic or difficult experiences . he also discovered that if he asked ordinary questions about these metaphors they had a " short half - life " -- i.e. they quickly disappeared and the client reverted to their usual conceptual description . through experimentation he found that if he asked very simple questions that made maximal use of the clients exact words and minimally presupposed any other information , client 's metaphors would stay around long enough to " confess their strengths " . and when they did , clients reported that their symptoms started to heal in unexpected ways . as a result david embarked on a 20-year journey into the world of metaphor and the use of clean language . david grove 's questions are ' clean ' because they minimally ' contaminate ' the client 's perceptions with the therapist or coach 's own m.a.p . ( metaphors , assumptions and presuppositions ) . the facilitator is only allowed to use the client 's words and the precise wording of the questions . facilitators do not add any words of their own . david grove says " the i - ness of the therapist should appear to cease to exist . " instead , the aim of a clean question is to invite the client to attend to a particular aspect of their own experience . in the context of therapy or coaching , ' clean ' does not mean ' no influence ' . quite the contrary , these questions are highly influential because they are clean . this is a very different kind of influence to that of most other questions . symbolic modelling david grove is the originator of clean language . our contribution has been to specify the components of clean language : the syntax , vocal qualities , nonverbals , and clean questions . we have also categorised and explained the value of the questions , extended their function outside of psychotherapy , and situated them within a modelling frame -- called symbolic modelling . symbolic modelling is a bottom - up systemic process . it utilises clean language , client - generated metaphor and modelling . modelling is the methodology , metaphor the medium , and clean language is the means . modelling david grove we will be eternally grateful to david grove for consistently grounding his research in the experience of his clients . by the time we started modelling david in 1995 he had developed a tried - and - tested ( but ever changing ) set of clean questions . every year since then we have attended his retreats and workshops in the uk ( and a few in the usa ) . this has enabled us to observe him working with a wide range of individuals and to experience the process for ourselves as clients . one of our outcomes was to produce a model which covered the entire history of david 's use of clean language and was not related to the order in which he discovered the questions . we taped every client session we could and spent hours examining the transcripts for patterns . we also obtained tapes , videos and transcripts of him working between 1989 to 1992 so we had access to his early use of clean language . one of our modelling techniques was to take sample client sessions from across the years and count the number of times he asked each question . we discovered that he used variations of the same nine questions over and over . these accounted for as much as 80 % of all questions he asked . a breakthrough in our thinking came when we started to classify the questions by the kind of experience they invited the client to attend to . this led us to realise that clean language was ideal for modelling " the structure of subjective experience " in general , and metaphoric perception and symbolic representations in particular . version 1 ( 1996 ) because the totality of a client 's symbolic representations is called a metaphor landscape , we adopted the metaphor of a compass to show how the questions facilitated the client to navigate around their own landscape ( see figure 1 ) . the arrows of the compass indicate the ' direction ' the client 's attention moves in order to access one of five classes of information : the attributes of a symbol or a component of perception the location of a symbol within perceptual space a subsequent event ( after ) a previous event ( before ) a shift / conversion / translation from conceptual or abstract description to an equivalent metaphor or symbolic representation . the ' nine - question compass ' model was first published in the spring 1997 issue of rapport : figure 1 : the original nine - questions compass ( note : " ... " are the client 's exact words ) the basic nine clean questions are context independent and can be asked almost anytime during the process . in addition to the basic questions we identified a further 20 or so specialised questions which david grove asked occasionally , but only under certain conditions . the specialised questions are only clean when the client has stated or presupposed a relevant context exists in their landscape . for example , a client says : they 're coming at me all at once . because the client 's language presupposes there is more than one of ' them ' , the specialised question " and how many ... ? " can legitimately be asked : and how many could be coming at you all at once ? ( note : words in bold have been introduced by the facilitator . ) version 2 ( 1998 ) by 1998 we had made two modifications to our first model . we shifted " and does ... have a size or shape ? " from the basic to the specialised category . we also separated " and where is ... ? " and " and whereabouts ... ? " into individual questions . these changes resulted from two insights . first , " and does ... have a size or shape ? " is only clean when the client has referred to part of their experience as an ' it ' or presupposed that it is thing - like . perceiving our experience as thing - like is very common -- but it is not universal . for instance , in the metaphor " i need to let go of my anger , " anger is referred to as if it is some thing that can be " let go of " . therefore it is clean to ask the ' size or shape ? ' question : and when you need to let go of your anger , does that anger have a size or a shape ? whereas " i need to feel angry " characterises anger as a sensation which may or may not be thing - like . therefore it would not be clean to ask the ' size or shape ? ' question . this question requires that certain conditions exist before it can be asked cleanly , so we moved it to the list of specialised questions . second , in english ' whereabouts ? ' can either mean ' where approximately ? ' ( e.g. " and whereabouts is your future ? " ) or ' where more specifically ? ' ( e.g. " and whereabouts inside ? " ) . the difference depends on whether ' whereabouts ? ' is asked of a symbol or of an already defined location . to fill the gap left by the removal of ' size or shape ? ' from the compass we split ' where ? ' and ' whereabouts ? ' into individual questions . figure 2 shows the version of the compass which appeared in our book metaphors in mind : transformation through symbolic modelling published in 2000 . 3 figure 2 : the updated 9-basic clean question compass version 3 ( 2003 ) since metaphors in mind was published we have trained hundreds of people to use clean language and have observed how they have acquired the model . we have also observed how students who became expert at asking the questions apply the model . in addition , discussions with other trainers of clean language and symbolic modelling stimulated our thinking . as a result we have updated the model again and it has acquired a greater independence from its source , david grove -- with his blessing we might add . the criteria by which a question was included in the original model was frequency of use by david grove . in the latest version our criteria has moved away from david 's use of clean language ( he is currently developing clean space 4 ) and towards people acquiring an inclusive set of questions which can be used in a variety of applications ; naturally in psychotherapy and coaching , but also in health , business and education . we call the latest version the ' 9 + 3 basic clean language questions ' . it is possible to conduct entire symbolic modelling sessions with just these twelve . we have continued to classify the questions by what they invite the client to attend to . each category is based on a fundamental metaphor of perception that almost everyone uses to construct their model of the world and organise their experience : developing ( the current perception ) attributes and is there anything else about ... ? and what kind of ... ? location and where / whereabouts is ... ? relationship and is there a relationship between ... and ... ? and when ... , what happens to ... ? metaphor and that 's ... like what ? moving time before and what happens just before ... ? after and then what happens / what happens next ? source and where does / could ... come from ? intention desired outcome and what would ... like to have happen ? necessary conditions and what needs to happen for ... ? and can ... ? from compass to molecule figure 3 uses a molecule to depict the client 's experience . we switched from a compass to a molecule metaphor for two reasons . first we want to emphasise interconnectedness rather than direction . second , the molecule represents the client 's perception , both foreground ( inside the centre sphere ) and background ( outside the centre sphere ) . as modellers we want the client 's perceptions to be central to everything the facilitator says and does . by placing the questions around the outside we are emphasising that first the facilitator decides which sphere of perception they would like the client to attend to , and then they ask a question that invites them to attend to that part of their experience . figure 3 : attending to the ' molecule ' of perception using the 9 + 3 basic clean language questions ( the arrow signifies that the developing questions are asked of the current perception ) our thinking changes developing questions hold time still and maintain the client 's attention on some aspect of their current perception . version 3 includes two extra developing questions which invite the client to attend to the relationship between two aspects ( ' x ' and ' y ' ) of their metaphor landscape : and is there a relationship between ' x ' and ' y ' ? and when ' x ' , what happens to ' y ' ? we consider these two questions basic because human perception is a gestalt ; it is interconnected and therefore symbols in a metaphor landscape are always in relation to each other . in fact every sentence contains words which indicate relationships & emdash ; verbs and prepositions for instance . the second major change is the inclusion of a new category of intention questions . the distinction between the first nine basic questions and the ' + 3 ' intention questions is vital . the first nine are used to model ' what is ' . the three intention questions invite the client to self - model their desired outcome and the conditions under which that outcome can happen . the intention questions , coupled with the client 's desire to change , turn symbolic modelling from a ' pure ' modelling process into a modelling - based change process . this is why " and what would you like to have happen ? " is used to initiate most symbolic modelling therapy or coaching sessions . other minor revisions to the model involved deciding that ' where ? ' and ' whereabouts ? ' invite the client to attend to the same kind of experience ( i.e. the location of an item in their perceptual space ) and could therefore be regarded as variations of the same question . you may have noticed that this reverts to the formulation in version 1 of the model ! we also decided that both ' then what happens ? ' and ' what happens next ? ' invite a client to attend to an event after the one currently in their perception . in common parlance , ' forward in time ' . therefore we now classify these two questions as one . the final change in version 3 is the separation of " and where could / does ... come from ? " into its own category called source . we did this to make it clear that this question invites the client to attend to a different kind of information ( the origin of ' x ' , cause of ' x ' or from whence ' x ' came ) than simply ' moving time back ' to the previous event . example using figure 3 as a guide we take a client 's statement and show how each of the 9 + 3 questions invites them to attend to a different sphere of their experience . facilitator : and what would you like to have happen ? client : i would like to feel strong and stand up to others . at this point , as a facilitator you have numerous options depending on where you wish to direct the client 's attention . below we list these options in two broad categories : within the client 's current perception ( inside the centre sphere of figure 3 ) . outside the current perception ( to one of the surrounding spheres ) . the left - hand column indicates the sphere of experience you want the client to attend to , the right - hand column the clean question that will likely direct the client 's attention there . within the current perception attributes and is there anything else about stand up to others ? and what kind of strong is that strong ? location and where / whereabouts do you feel strong ? relationship and is there a relationship between feel strong and stand up to others ? and when you feel strong , what happens to others ? metaphor and that 's strong like what ? outside the current perception event before and what happens just before you feel strong ? event after and then what happens / what happens next ? source and where does / could that feel strong come from ? desired outcome and when you 'd like to feel strong and stand up to others , what would you like to have happen now ? necessary conditions and what needs to happen for you to feel strong ? and can you feel strong ? working systemically within symbolic modelling , clean language is applied systemically . that is with an awareness of working with the non - linear and emergent properties of a human system . clean language can be used in this way because : the simplicity of the questions enable a system 's complexity to emerge ' uncontaminated ' by the metaphors , assumptions and presuppositions of the facilitator . it works with a system 's natural tendency to display an idiosyncratic directionality , i.e. to follow a unique developmental path . it can work at multiple levels of organisation : component , relationship , pattern , and pattern of organisation . by enabling an individual or group to map a network of relationships they discover the wisdom in their own system that is not contained in any of the parts , but is embodied in the configuration of the whole . when using symbolic modelling in a therapy or coaching context , the facilitator 's role is to use clean language to invite the client to attend to various aspects of their perception so that they self - model . the client 's role is to find out how their perceptions work together as a system -- and for that to operate as feedback so that they continually learn from their own experience . and because we keep learning from our colleagues , students and clients , we can be sure that in the years to come our model of clean language with evolve still further . � 2004 , james lawley and penny tompkins 1 david j. grove and b.i. panzer , resolving traumatic memories : metaphors and symbols in psychotherapy ( irvington , 1989 ) , p. 1 . 2 penny tompkins and james lawley , less is more ... the art of clean language , rapport magazine , issue 35 , february 1997 . 3 james lawley and penny tompkins , metaphors in mind : transformation through symbolic modelling ( the developing company press , 2000 ) . 4 penny tompkins and james lawley , clean space : modeling human perception through emergence , anchor point , vol . 17 , no . 8 , september 2003 . thanks to phil swallow , wendy sullivan and marian way for feedback and helpful suggestions . penny tompkins and james lawley are ukcp registered psychotherapists , coaches in business , and certified nlp trainers . they are authors of metaphors in mind : transformation through symbolic modelling and have recently produced a training video / dvd , a strange and strong sensation . this shows a complete symbolic modelling client session with on -

reactive protein , fibrin d - dimer , and incident ischemic heart disease in the speedwell study - are inflammation and fibrin turnover linked in pathogenesis ? arteriosclerosis thrombosis and vascular biology 21 ( 4 ): pp . 603 - 610 . full text of this document is not available in this eprints service . abstract plasma levels of c - reactive protein ( crp , a marker of the reactant plasma protein component of the inflammatory response ) and of fibrin d - dimer ( a marker of cross - linked fibrin turnover ) have each been associated in recent studies with the risk of future ischemic heart disease ( ihd ) . previous experimental studies have shown that fibrin degradation products , including d - dimer , have effects on inflammatory processes and acute - phase protein responses . in the speedwell prospective study , we therefore measured crp and d - dimer levels in stored plasma samples from 1690 men aged 49 to 67 years who were followed - up for incident ihd for an average of 75 + /- 4 months ( mean + /- sd ) and studied their associations with each other , with baseline and incident ihd , and with ihd risk factors . crp and d - dimer levels were each associated with age , plasma fibrinogen , smoking habit , and baseline evidence of ihd . crp was associated with d - dimer ( r=0.21 , p lt 0.00001 ) . on univariate analyses , both crp and d - dimer were associated with incident ihd . the incidence of ihd increased with crp independently of the level of d - dimer ( p=0.0002 ) and also increased with d - dimer independently of the level of crp ( p=0.048 ) . in multivariate analyses , inclusion of d - dimer and conventional risk factors reduced the strength of the association between crp and incident ihd ; likewise , inclusion of crp and conventional risk factors reduced the strength of the association between d - dimer and incident ihd . we conclude that although these respective markers of inflammation and fibrin turnover show modest association with each other in middle - aged men , they may have additive associations with risk , of incident ihd . further larger studies are required to test this hypothesis ._. _ _ 70 south lambeth road london sw8 1rl tel : 020 7735 7845 , fax : 020 7840 5811 sms : 07921 700 089 , email : info@nrac.org.uk database of members | news and events | contact us | accessibility | resources you are here : home > resources > training courses courses in inclusive design and access the nrac does not accredit or specifically recommend any of the following courses . application to the nrac is skills based and there is not a direct link between any of the following courses and gaining membership of the nrac . these details are provided only to assist those seeking to locate courses . all details known at the time of writing have been included . short courses long courses short courses acsestra contact course director richard cullingworth , dipsurv frics nrac consultant . tel 01604 494963 or email rcullingworth@cs2.co.uk . more details on the website www.acsestra.co.uk access audit training an intensive two -

" but do you think it 's true , ingle ? " said west . " think what is true ? " " that the boers have invaded natal . " " i 'm sure it is , " was the reply ; " and before very long we shall have them here . " " why should they come here ? " said west . " because they have plenty of gold at johannesburg , and they want to utilise it for settings to our diamonds , my lad . they 're a nice , modest , amiable people , these boers , with very shrewd eyes for the main chance . they 'll soon be down here to take possession , so if you feel at all uncomfortable you had better be off south . " " is that what you are going to do ? " asked west quietly . " i ? of course not ! i shall keep with the volunteers . " " of course , " said west ; " and i shall too . " ingleborough smiled grimly and went on with his work , west following suit , and they were busy enough till " tiffin "- time that morning . their " tiffin " went on as usual ; but out in the town there was a buzz of excitement which resembled that heard in a beehive when some mischievous boy has thrust in a switch and given it a good twist round before running for his life . so eager and excited did everyone seem that west could hardly tear himself away from the main street , which was full of talking groups , everyone seeming to be asking the same question--"what is to be done first ?"-- but getting no reply . " we ought to fortify the place , " said west to himself , and full of this idea , which he intended to propound to ingleborough and anson as soon as he reached the office , he hurried in that direction , all the faster from the fact that he had been so interested in the busy state of the streets that he had overstayed his time . on approaching the office door the conscious blood rose to his cheeks , for he could hear an angry voice speaking , upon which he could only place one interpretation -- namely , that one of the principals was finding fault severely because he , the guilty one , was not back to his time . " what a fool i am ! " muttered west . then , pulling himself together , he stepped forward , muttering again : " must take my dose like a man . " the next moment he had opened the door quickly , entered and closed it , and then stood staring in wonder at the scene before him . for there was no angry principal present -- only his two fellow - clerks : ingleborough stern and frowning , and anson with his ordinarily pink face turned to a sallow white , and , instead of being plump and rounded , looking sunken and strange . " what 's the matter ? " said west , for anson , who had the moment before been talking rapidly , suddenly ceased . " you 're not quarrelling , are you ? " he continued , for no one replied . " oh well , i 'll be off till you 've done . " " no , do n't go , " cried anson , springing forward and grasping his arm . " let go ! " cried west . " i do n't want to be mixed up with any quarrels ; but you might have got them over outside . there , i 'm off . " " stop where you are ! " cried ingleborough . " you have a perfect right to hear what i have said , and you 're welcome . " " yes , stop where you are , west , " cried anson , clinging to the young fellow 's arm . " i believe that the war scare has sent ingle off his head . you never heard such a bit of scandal as he is trying to hatch up . i believe it 's all out of jealousy . " " no , you do not , " said ingleborough coldly . " but i do , " cried anson . " it 's scandalous . he 's trying to ruin me . " " how ? " " by hatching up a story which , if it got to the principals ' ears , would mean me being turned off neck and crop , no matter how innocent i am . " " how what ? " replied ingleborough ironically . " innocent ? why , i 've suspected you for some months past . " " oh , my gracious ! " cried anson . " hark at him ! he does mean it -- he must mean it , unless we can bring him to his senses , west . you will help me , wo n't you ? " " how can i tell till i know what it 's all about ? what 's the quarrel , ingle ? " " ask him , " answered the young man addressed , frowning . " very well , then ; i 'll ask him . what 's the row , anson ? " " i have hardly patience to tell you , west , " was the reply . " but i suppose i must , though it makes my face burn with shame . " " humph ! " grunted ingleborough . " then it is something you are ashamed of ? " said west quickly . " me ? oh no , west ; i 'm not ashamed . i 've nothing to be ashamed of : only being accused by a fellow - clerk , a brother - clerk , i might say , of doing a terrible thing . " " and did you ? " said west sharply . " i ? good gracious , no ! i was out in the main street about half - an - hour ago , being of course interested in the news , when i saw a couple of kaffirs talking , and it made me wonder what would become of them if it came to fighting , and i naturally enough asked the poor fellows whether they 'd stay in kimberley or go back to their own country . " " well ? " said west , for the speaker stopped . " well , that 's all as far as i 'm concerned , " said anson ; " only just then ingleborough , who is never happy without he 's mixing himself up somehow with the police folk , and who must have been watching me in a miserable underhanded way , suddenly pounced upon me ; and you 'll never believe it , my dear west , he actually accused me of illicit - diamond - buying from the kaffirs . " " and that means very severe punishment , " said west . " well , were you doing it ? " " was i ? oh , for shame , west ! how could you think such a thing possible ? my dear fellow , i could n't do such a thing ? is it likely ? " " ingleborough says it is , " replied the young man addressed , shortly . " yes , but only because he is absurdly jealous of me , and dislikes to see me in the office . it would ruin me for ever if it were reported , and he says he is going to , although i have been begging and praying him not to do such a thing . what do you say ? " " if it 's true , and ingleborough says it is , i do n't see how he could help , reporting your conduct to the directors . " " but it is n't true ! " cried anson , almost in a whine . " oh , west , how can you ? you know i could n't do such a thing ! " " do you mean to say that you are quite innocent ? " " oh , quite ! " cried anson . " it was as i told you . i only asked the two poor hard - working fellows what they meant to do , and then to my utter astonishment ingleborough pounced upon me with that terrible charge . help me , my dear friend , to make him see that he has deceived himself ! " " do you hear , ingle ? " cried west sympathetically . " it is a terrible charge to bring against a fellow . " " terrible ! " said ingleborough sternly . " and you have thought what it means ? " " of course . " " his dismissal and imprisonment ? " " yes . " " but-- " " there is no room for buts , my lad , " said ingleborough harshly . " diamond - buying from the natives is , as we all well know , penal ; and we know , too , that it is our duty to help to protect the property of our employers , and to see that the laws are obeyed . " " of course , my dear ingleborough , " said anson ; " and that 's what i have always tried to do , as you know . " " i know that you have been playing a false game for months -- that is , i feel perfectly sure you have , though i can not prove it . but this i can prove : that you were buying stolen diamonds from two natives this afternoon , all parties choosing the time because you believed the excitement would secure you from notice . " " oh , west , hark at him ! " cried anson , in a piteous tone . " ingleborough , you do n't know how wrong you are ! " " that 's true ! " said their fellow - clerk . " look here , anson , " cried west angrily ; " what 's the good of going on like a great girl -- oh - ing , and making weak appeals ? why do n't you speak out like a man ? is it true , or is it not , that you bought these diamonds ? " " it 's all a mistake of ingleborough 's and as false as false can be ! i could n't do such a thing ! " " nor yet throw them away as soon as you found that you were seen ? " " of course not ! " cried anson excitedly . " what are these , then ? " cried ingleborough sternly , as he took a couple of rough crystals from his trousers pocket and held them out in his hand to the astonished gaze of his comrades . " those ? " said anson , whose face began to turn of a sickly green ; " they look like diamonds . " " yes : they are the two that you threw away , and which i went and picked up . " " oh ! " cried anson , with a piteous groan ; " hark at him , west ! i would n't have believed that a man could have been so base as to hatch up such a plot as this to ruin his brother - employ � . west , i assure you that i never set eyes upon those diamonds before in my life . it 's all a cruel , dastardly plot , and i-- oh dear ! oh dear ! oh dear ! is it possible that a man can be so base ? " he took out his handkerchief and applied it to his eyes , uttering a low piteous groan the while . " you hear this , ingleborough ? " said west . " yes , i hear , " said ingleborough sourly , as he thrust the gems back in his pocket . " so do you , and you know now what it is my duty to do . " west was silent . " oh , do speak and help me ! " cried anson . " do n't stand by and see me ruined , west ! you know how he has taken up lately with the new superintendent of police , and been always with him , and watching the poor natives till he is half a detective himself , and goes about suspecting innocent people . i am innocent , west , and it 's all a horrible mistake of his , or a cruel trick to ruin me ; and i 'm afraid i 've been mistaken in him altogether , and that it is a wicked conspiracy . " " ingleborough would n't do a mean thing ! " said west warmly . " that 's what i want to believe , " whined anson ; " but he 's got hold of two diamonds , and he 's going to charge me with buying them , and he 'll get me sent to cape town breakwater . " " not if you are innocent ! " said west . " well , that 's what i am , and he ca n't prove that i 've any of the precious stones about me . come and search me if you like ! " " you will be searched by the police authorities , " said ingleborough sternly . " what!--oh , it 's abominable ! " cried anson . " here , west , are n't you going to do anything to help an innocent man ? " " what can i do , " said west , " but look on ? i 'll tell you this , though : i do n't believe it possible of you ! there must be some mistake ! " " thank you for nothing , " cried anson bitterly . " it 's the old story -- and you call yourself a friend ! well , i 'm not going to be bullied . i 've given you both a chance to own that you are all wrong ; but you always were both of you dead against me . i 'll do now what i ought to have done at once -- go to the principals . i shall get justice there . " saying this , he clapped on his hat , giving it a fierce cock on one side , passed out , and banged the door after him . ingleborough paid no heed to his companion 's enquiring look , but crossed quickly to the window and looked out . " anson thinks he is going to make a bolt , " said ingleborough , half to himself ; " but he 'll soon find out his mistake . " " how ? " said west eagerly . " norton is outside with a couple of the police , " ingleborough replied . " but this is very horrible ! " cried west . " once more , are you quite sure that you have not made a mistake ? " " quite ! i am certain ! " " but is it wise to be so certain ? " " yes , " replied ingleborough quietly . " surely i can believe my own eyes ! " " but might he not have been questioning the kaffirs , as he said ? " " certainly , " replied ingleborough , with a grim smile ; " but i do not see why he should receive two diamonds from them and give them money in exchange , and lastly why he should flick the two diamonds away into the dust as soon as he caught sight of me . do you ? " " no , " said west thoughtfully . " well , i am very sorry . what will be the next proceeding ? " " the next thing in an ordinary way would be that the scoundrel would bolt ; but , as he must have found out by this time that he is carefully watched , he will no doubt go straight to the principals and brave it out by telling them his own tale and trying to persuade them that i have hatched up a conspiracy against him . " " and of course he will not be believed , " replied west thoughtfully ; " for it is next door to high treason for anyone to be found buying diamonds illicitly from the natives . " " high treason ? " cried ingleborough , laughing . " why , my dear boy , it 's much worse than regicide . the authorities in kimberley look upon diamond - smuggling or stealing as the blackest crime in the calendar . " " hallo ! " cried west just then . " so soon ? " for there was a sharp rap at the door , and a man entered to announce that the principals of the great company desired the presence of ingleborough and west directly . " i do n't see why they want me ! " said west . " i know nothing about the matter . " " you 'll have to go all the same , " said ingleborough . " he has dragged your name into the case , and he trusts to you to speak in his behalf . " " and of course i shall , " said west ; " for i 'm horribly sorry for the poor fellow . he could n't withstand the temptation to buy the diamonds for a mere nothing and sell them at a heavy price .

we abseiled in , and found it was actually not all that deep . if you stood on tip toes on the highest point of the floor , your head nearly poked out of the entrance . as we had two lengths of rope , we sent everyone on ahead to get down the next pitch while i pulled through the entrance rope , or at least tried to . it would not budge . i prussiced back out and rearranged it much further up the tree trunk it was wrapped around , and went back down . it still would not budge ! paul reappeared to see what was taking me so long . two of us could not move it . the friction of the tree bark plus the angle the rope pulled over the lip of the entrance was too much . so paul ended up testing the free - climbability of the pitch and pulled the rope down from near to the top . the second pitch was no problem . the third was somewhat vertical and around 8 m deep . quite possibly free climbable , but not for the faint hearted . we decided to leave it rigged with the spare rope just in case . the subsequent pitches were all easily climbable , and we did not need to abseil many of them . i was taking the occasional photograph in the streamway while waiting for gary to rig climbs ahead . i was surprised that we had got as far as we had without any sign of sheila wanting to head back , when we reached the final pitch . this was permanently rigged with a nice traverse out along the left wall to a nice 12 m drop back into the stream . i took a number of photographs of people doing the traverse and descending the pitch . it was at this stage that it became apparent that sheila was really tired . we were so close to the bottom of the cave here that it seemed the easiest option was to carry on . i remembered a short muddy flat out crawl leading into easier going which connected via a rope climb with the grand salle of the trou du vent . from there the way out was well known to us now , and easy going compared to the long narrow descending streamway of the trou mile . what i had forgotten was that the rope climb was bloody awkward , and followed by a long awkward ascending slope which was all coated in what appeared to be a mixture of fine mud and cooking oil ! paul , caroline and gary proceeded to help sheila up all of this , leaving martin and i stuck at the back in a muddy chamber . then martin noticed a cave millipede on the wall . he said these were quite rare , and we spent a happy hour trying to photograph it while the sounds of struggling came down from above . while we were chasing the millipede around the wall with the camera , we discovering two more of them ! by the time we were all up the greasy climb it was clear that sheila was now very tired indeed . once in the grand salle , we could gain half the total ascent back to the surface by walking up the steep slope of the chamber . sheila was finding this difficult going , struggling to put one foot in front of the other . the last time i saw someone this exhausted at the bottom of a cave was with tony trauma on the legendary rift pot - large pot exchange . we decided that caroline and paul should head on out to get some pulleys and extra food from the car , while we plodded along with sheila . it took a long time to reach the bottom of the pitches , and it was clear that sheila needed a hauling system setting up . this needed to be done in three stages on the bottom pitch because of the changing angles of the descent . more of a long ramp than a proper pitch . having done training sessions in gyms and chapel some years ago , i was glad that with some helpful suggestions from gary i was soon hauling away with sheila safely ascending . paul and caroline reappeared as we neared the top of the pitch , and the pulleys they brought down really helped to reduce the friction in the haul rig compared to the bobbin and karabiners they replaced . it took a few more hours to haul sheila up the remaining three pitches . caroline and paul helped haul and reassure sheila . gary made sure she was safely attached at the bottom of each section , and martin single handedly derigged the pitches behind us ( all 3 tackle bags worth ! ) . we were entertained in the entrance pitch by bats which flew orbits around our heads . on the surface we found the bats would chase after pistachio shells when we threw them ! we had everyone out of the cave by ? am , and i reassured sheila that she had not broken the record set by tony trauma of a 7 am exit ! overall the trip was a big success in it 's way . a superb team effort where everyone played a valuable role , and our first practical underground application of those rescue skills we hope we have learned in training sessions but had not previously used in a real life situation . apart from sheila i think we all really quite enjoyed ourselves , and after a good night ( and days ) rest sheila was recovered too , although strangely reluctant to take up our offers of more caving !

includes picture !_. _ _ below is a series of brief descriptions of some of the more serious diseases that international travellers may encounter . fortunately these diseases are rare and the vast majority of travellers will never come across them . there are also effective vaccines available for immunisation against most of them . typhoid fever typhoid fever is a life - threatening illness caused by the bacterium salmonella typhi . it belongs to the salmonella group which contains nearly 2,000 different types causing mild diseases such as food poisoning , through to the more serious disease of typhoid fever . paratyphoid fever is a similar but less severe variant . it is a common illness in the developing world , where it affects about 12.5 million people each year . typhoid fever occurs in most parts of the world except in developed countries such as the united kingdom , western europe , usa , canada , australia , new zealand and japan . therefore , if you are traveling to the developing world , you should consider taking precautions . travellers to asia , africa , and latin america are especially at risk . the typhoid fever bacteria is carried in the bloodstream and intestinal tract of infected persons . a small number of persons , called carriers , recover from the fever but continue to carry the bacteria . both ill persons and carriers shed the bacteria in their feces . diagnosis requires medical opinion and examination of the blood . you can get typhoid fever if you eat food or drink beverages that have been contaminated by a person who is shedding s. typhi or if sewage contaminated with s. typhi bacteria gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food . therefore , typhoid fever is more common in areas of the world where handwashing is less frequent and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage . the incubation period depends on the quantity of the bacteria swallowed and can vary from one to three weeks . persons with typhoid fever usually have a sustained fever as high as 39 � or 40 � c. they will also feel weak , have stomach pains , headache and loss of appetite . in some cases , patients have a rash of flat , rose - colored spots . treatment : typhoid fever is usually treated with antibiotics such as ampicillin or ciprofloxacin which are very effective but should ideally be given under medical supervision . hospital admission may be more appropriate abroad . persons treated with antibiotics usually improve within 2 to 3 days , and deaths rarely occur . however , relapse is not uncommon and patients may develop the carrier state after treatment . it is therefore very important to have your stools examined on your return if you have been treated for typhoid abroad . without treatment this illness can be fatal!!. persons who do not receive treatment may continue to have the fever for weeks or months , and as many as 20 % may die from complications such as peritonitis resulting from perforation of the gut wall . typhoid fever can be prevented and can usually be treated with antibiotics . if you are planning to travel to a region where it exists , you should know about it and what steps you can take to protect yourself . there are two basic actions that can help to protect you from typhoid fever : 1 . get vaccinated against typhoid fever . 2 . avoid risky foods and drinks . watching what you eat and drink when you travel is just as important as being vaccinated . this is because the vaccines are not completely effective . avoiding risky foods will also help protect you from other illnesses , including travelers ' diarrhoea , cholera , dysentery , and hepatitis a. tetanus tetanus is a potentially fatal disease which is caused by an infection of the bacterium clostridium tetani . the bacteria enter the body through a wound where they grow and produce a powerful toxin which circulates in the blood and causes muscular rigidity and painful muscle contractions . death is usually caused by respiratory problems and exhaustion . tetanus spores are present in soil worldwide and may be introduced into the body during injury through a puncture wound , burn or trivial , unnoticed wounds . tetanus can be contracted quite easily through a small wound such as a scratch through which the organism can get into the body . there have been reported cases of tetanus in which the patient can not even remember the injury since it was so small and insignificant . while vaccination has largely diminished the incidence of tetanus , the disease has not disappeared . if individuals are not fully immunised there is always the risk of tetanus developing in wounds contaminated by soil . the incubation period is between four and twenty one days , commonly around ten days . the first sign of tetanus is when the patient may notice jaw stiffness and difficulty in opening the mouth ( lock jaw ) . treatment : requires medical supervision in hospital . prevention : all wounds , even minor ones should be thoroughly washed with clean water and soap taking particular care to remove all dirt and loose tissue . immunisation against tetanus is highly protective and adults and children should ensure they are in date for it . booster doses should be given at ten year intervals . booster doses in addition to five doses are not recommended except in the case of the treatment of a tetanus - prone wound . the department of health advised in 2002 that tetanus vaccine is to be replaced by the combined tetanus / low dose diphtheria vaccine for adults and adolescents for routine use and for travel vaccination . stocks of single tetanus vaccine are now exhausted and companies are no longer supplying this product . poliomyelitis ( polio ) poliomyelitis , normally referred to as polio is caused by a virus which is spread from person - to - person primarily through faecal contamination of food and water although it can also be spread by droplet transfer . initially , infection of the gut can spread to the spinal cord or brain where it can cause paralysis . in the days before widespread vaccination it tended to occur in epidemics . travellers who have not been immunised or whose immunity has waned are at risk if they are travelling to areas of the world where polio still occurs . ie . nigeria , niger , india , pakistan and afghanistan are particularly high risk . in many cases infection with the polio virus is asymptomatic . when symptoms do occur , the onset of polio is sudden with fever , headache , nausea and vomiting as the virus multiplies in the gut . the virus then invades the blood stream and nervous system . paralysis occurs in less than 1 in 100 cases of infection . this risk increases with age . the patient may die if the respiratory and swallowing muscles are affected . those who survive may develop residual paralysis . severe pain , and wasting are common in paralysed muscles . recovery can take up to a year . the incubation period is 7 - 14 days . a blood test for antibodies will confirm the diagnosis , although this is not always available abroad . patients are infectious by close contact and should be isolated for at least a week . treatment : the development of paralysis is clearly an emergency and medical help should be sought without delay . if the paralysis affects the breathing muscles , artificial means of respiration may be required . extreme care should be taken when disposing of excreta for up to 6 weeks . prevention : there is an effective vaccine available . ten yearly boosters should be given to ensure maximum immunity and travellers should ensure they are in date for polio immunisation . past infection with polio does not always give complete protection as there are three strains of the virus . as the disease is usually spread through close contact , try to avoid crowded places in high risk areas as much as possible . ( buses , trains , public swimming pools ) . this could prove difficult in some countries such as india . therefore vaccination would be imperative if travelling there . the world health organisation is making great efforts to encourage widespread use of polio vaccine in an attempt to eradicate polio from all the countries of the world . many countries have already been certified polio free by the who . by 1994 , the americas were certified as polio - free . hepatitis a this is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver . it occurs worldwide and is especially prevalent in areas of poor sanitation and hygiene . many children in developing countries are infected with the virus at an early age , usually without symptoms . past infection with hepatitis a virus gives life long immunity . however , in the developed world where sanitation is better , fewer people are contracting the disease during childhood and are therefore at risk when they become adults from the more severe form of the disease , which they could catch when they travel to areas of the world where hepatitis a is more common . the map below shows the global incidence of hepatitis a. the virus is transmitted from person - to - person by the faecal - oral route particularly in areas with poor sanitation and overcrowding . it is quickly spread through close contact , particularly within families and institutions and is commonly associated with eating and drinking contaminated food and water . food outbreaks are often linked to raw or undercooked shellfish and raw vegetables although almost any food can be implicated which has been poorly cooked in sewage - polluted water . hepatitis a has a wide range of symptoms , from an infection without any noticeable symptoms through to jaundice , liver failure and death . unlike hepatitis b , there is no chronic carrier state for hepatitis a. symptoms include fever , chills , weakness , loss of appetite , nausea and abdominal discomfort , followed within a few days by jaundice ( yellowing of the skin and eyes ) . the urine becomes dark and the stools pale . jaundice may be severe and prolonged and complete liver failure may occur . prevention : avoid contaminated food and water . hepatitis a can be prevented by vaccination . the immunisation schedule consists of a single dose of vaccine followed by a booster dose six to twelve months after the first dose to give immunity up to ten years . cholera cholera is a bacterial infection of the gastro - intestinal tract caused by the bacterium vibrio cholerae . these bacteria are typically ingested by drinking water contaminated by improper sanitation or by eating improperly cooked fish , especially shell fish . about one million vibrio cholerae bacteria must be ingested to cause cholera in normally healthy adults , although increased susceptibility may be observed in those with weakened immune systems , individuals with decreased gastric acidity ( as from the use of antacids etc . ) , or those who are malnourished . the incubation period is usually two to three days but may only be a few hours . symptoms range from the mild to the severe which may be fatal and include ; diarrhoea , abdominal cramps , nausea , vomiting , and dehydration . vibrio cholerae causes the disease by producing a toxin that induces severe painless watery diarrhoea of sudden onset , occasionally accompanied by vomiting , which rapidly leads to dehydration . the profuse diarrhoea allows the bacterium to spread to other people under insanitary conditions . the bacteria are transmitted in water or food contaminated with infected faeces and the disease can occur in large - scale epidemics where sanitary conditions have broken down such as those in areas of natural disasters . cholera is rare amongst travellers as they tend to avoid the insanitary conditions which would put them at risk . treatment : medical help should be sought without delay . cholera is treated with rehydration and antibiotics , but in severe cases , can lead to death . fluid replacement is essential and should be started as soon as symptoms occur . the patient should aim to drink as much non - alcoholic fluid as it takes to maintain a good output of normal looking urine ( this may be as much as six or seven litres a day ) . prevention : avoid contaminated food and water , especially raw or undercooked seafood from polluted water . there is a new vaccine ( dukoral ) for immunisation against cholera for people travelling to highly endemic or epidemic areas , particularly emergency relief and health workers in refugee situations . the vaccine may be considered for the following : people working in areas where there are known cholera outbreaks ( e.g. aid workers ) . travellers staying for long periods in known high risk areas and/or where close contact with locals is likely , and who do not have access to medical care . travellers to risk areas who have an underlying gastro - intestinal disease or immune suppression . the vaccine is taken as a raspberry flavoured drink and can be used in adults and children over 2 years . it is not currently licensed in the uk for travellers diarrhoea . meningitis ( meningococcal ) meningitis is an infection that causes inflamation of the membranes and fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord . it can be caused by a viral or bacterial infection . viral meningitis is generally less severe and resolves without specific treatment , while bacterial meningitis ( meningococcal ) can be quite severe and may result in brain damage , coma or even death . it can occur in epidemics , especially where large crowds are gathered , as it is acquired through direct contact or inhalation of bacteria in droplets coughed or sneezed into the air . early diagnosis and treatment are very important . if symptoms occur , the patient should seek medical help immediately . medical supervision is required since large doses of antibiotics are employed . treatment should be started without delay . identification of the type of bacteria responsible is helpful for the selection of correct antibiotics . high fever , headache , and stiff neck and a blotchy rash are common symptoms . these can develop over several hours , or they may take 1 to 2 days . other symptoms may include nausea , vomiting , discomfort with bright lights , confusion , and sleepiness . as the disease progresses , patients may develop seizures before going into a coma . sporadic cases of meningitis are found worldwide . in temperate zones , most cases occur in the winter months . localized outbreaks occur in enclosed crowded spaces ( e.g. dormitories , military barracks ) . in sub - saharan africa , in a zone stretching across the continent from senegal to ethiopia ( known as the african � meningitis belt � ) , large outbreaks and epidemics take place during the dry season ( november � june ) . bacterial meningitis is contagious . the bacteria are spread by direct person to person contact including aerosol transmission and exchange of respiratory and throat secretions ( i.e. sneezing , coughing , kissing , etc . ) . fortunately , none of the bacteria that cause meningitis are as contagious as the viruses that spread the common cold or influenza , and they are not spread by casual contact or by simply breathing the air where a person with meningitis has been . the risk to travellers is generally low . however , the risk is considerable if travellers are in crowded conditions or taking part in large population movements such as pilgrimages eg . the haj to mecca . localized outbreaks occasionally occur among travellers ( usually young adults ) in camps or dormitories . backpackers who use crowded hostels will be at greater risk during an outbreak prevention : avoid overcrowded places and close contact with the local population . there are two vaccines used to protect travellers . the meningitis a + c vaccine and the meningitis acwy vaccine . the latter is required for pilgrims and seasonal workers visiting saudi arabia . effective treatment is undertaken with a number of antibiotics . it is important , however , that treatment be started early in the course of the disease . this will reduce the risk of mortality to below 15 % , although the risk is higher among the elderly . diphtheria diphtheria is an infection caused by a bacterium called corynebacterium diphtheriae that causes a moderately sore throat . sometimes the lining of the throat may swell to form " a false membrane " which can cause difficulties in breathing . in its early stages , diphtheria may be mistaken for a severe sore throat . in severe cases the neck tissue may become very swollen and in tropical countries the infection can occur in skin ulcers . it is mainly spread by droplets expelled from the nose and mouth usually by breathing in diphtheria bacteria after an infected person has coughed , sneezed or even laughed . it can also be spread by handling used tissues or by drinking from a glass used by an infected person . nearly one out of every ten people who get diphtheria will die from it . most cases occur among unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated people . the bacterium produces a toxin which can seriously damage the heart muscle and the nervous system . after two to six weeks , the effects of the toxin produced by the bacteria become apparent with severe muscle weakness , mainly affecting the muscles of the head and neck . inflammation of the heart muscle can cause heart failure . death usually occurs either from respiratory failure , heart failure or a build up of toxin in the nervous system . whether or not the patient dies depends on the severity of the illness , their level of immunity and the speed with which treatment is started . one of the regions where diphtheria is present is eastern europe , including russia and the former states of the soviet union . cases of have occurred in finland , estonia , poland and belarus and even germany , belgium and the uk resulting from imported infection . treatment : this is specialised and requires medical supervision in hospital . prevention : try to avoid too close contact with people in crowded places when travelling in endemic regions ( particularly kissing and sharing bottles or glasses ) . diphtheria can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine . a vaccine is now available for travellers to provide protection against both diphtheria and tetanus . immunisation is very effective and uk children are immunised within their first year . boosters are required every 10 years for travellers and those at risk . rabies this is a viral infection that is acquired from the saliva of an infected or rabid animal , usually a dog or cat . in most cases infection results from a bite but even a lick on an open cut or sore may be enough . symptoms start with itching and tingling at the site of the healed bite and then rapidly progresses to include headache , fever , spreading paralysis , confusion , aggression and hydrophobia ( fear of water ) . it may take many weeks or months for symptoms to develop although it is usually two to eight weeks . animals may be infectious for five days before they develop symptoms . treatment : thoroughly cleanse all bites with soap and water and do not allow the wound to be stitched . limited bleeding should be encouraged . apply alcohol if possible . if available human immunoglobulin ( hrig ) should be given especially for bites to the head / face . the disease can almost always be prevented , even after exposure , if the vaccine is administered without delay . you should therefore seek medical advice immediately and have a course of 5 injections of purified chick embryo cell vaccine ( pcec ) or human diploid cell vaccine ( hdcv ) . this can be difficult to obtain abroad and if necessary the british embassy or consulate should be contacted for a supply . if you have had a pre - exposure course of vaccine you should still have a ' booster ' course of 2 doses of vaccine without delay . prevention : never approach or handle animals you do n't know , particularly if they are acting strangely . pre - exposure immunisation against rabies is recommended for long - stay travellers / residents and those who intend to travel to rural and remote areas . in the event of a bite , your body 's responses could be quickly activated by booster doses of vaccine . there are rarely any side effects or discomfort from the new type of vaccine unlike the old types . tuberculosis ( tb ) tuberculosis ( tb ) is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis and is one of the leading causes of all adult deaths worldwide . the disease is usually spread through infected sputum but there is a form spread through milk from infected cows . the bacteria that cause tb are inhaled in the form of microscopic droplets that come from a person infected with tb . when coughing , speaking or sneezing , small droplets are expelled into the air which quickly dry out but the bacteria can remain airborne for hours . however , the tuberculosis bacteria are killed when exposed to ultraviolet light , including sunlight . after the tuberculosis bacteria have been inhaled , they reach the lungs , and within approximately six weeks a small infection appears which rarely gives any symptoms but sometimes general malaise , weakness and weight loss are characteristic during the incubation period which may be up to twelve weeks . after this , the bacteria can then spread through the blood . the infection remains dormant in most cases in people who are otherwise healthy and does not do any obvious harm . months or even years later , however , the disease can become reactivated in different organs if the immune system is weakened . the lungs are the favourite place for the illness to strike . symptoms of tb include cough , blood in the sputum , weight loss , fatigue and night sweats . the bacteria can spread to the blood in individuals who have weak immune systems ( especially when caused by alcohol ) . tb is primarily a disease of the lungs causing persistent cough with fever and sweating . however , the infection can spread via blood from the lungs to other organs in the body , the bones , the urinary tract and sexual organs , the intestines and even in the skin . lymph nodes in the lungs and throat can also get infected . sometimes the disease can be overwhelming ; producing meningitis and coma ; this particularly dangerous form is usually found in children and those who have not previously been vaccinated or exposed to the disease . three million deaths occur each year from tb , which is more than any other single infectious disease . the disease is more common in areas of the world where poverty , malnutrition , poor general health and social disruption are present . the disease has been commonly found in places of crowding such as hostels and prisons where healthcare is poor . treatment : treatment with is effective but is prolonged . it is also expensive and effective and affordable antimicrobial drugs to treat tb disease have been available for decades but these must be taken for six to eight months under medical supervision because if treatment is not completed , the emergence of drug - resistant strains of the tb bacteria may be encouraged . these medicines may not always available abroad . prevention : avoid overcrowded places , particularly where spitting is common . never drink unpasteurised milk . if in doubt , boil it before drinking . there is a vaccination against tb which can give a valuable degree of protection , particularly in children . those who have not received bcg immunisation are advised to do so and if for travel purposes , at least six weeks before departure to ensure a protective level of immunity . schistosomiasis also known as bilharzia , is a disease caused by parasitic worms called schistosoma . they belong to the family of flat worms known as trematodes or flukes . there are several different species e.g. s. mansoni , s. haematobium , and s. japonicum . about 200 million people are thought to be infected world - wide . the infection occurs when the skin comes into contact with contaminated fresh water which contains a certain type of snail that carry the schistosomes . fresh water becomes contaminated by schistosoma eggs when people who are infected urinate or defaecate in the water . the eggs then hatch , and if the snails are present in the water , the parasites invade the snails and grow and develop inside them . the parasites eventually leaves the snails and enter the water where they can survive for up to 48 hours . schistosoma parasites can penetrate the skin of persons who are wading , swimming , bathing , or washing in contaminated water . within several weeks , worms grow inside the blood vessels of the body and produce eggs . some of these eggs travel to the bladder or intestines and are passed into the urine or stools . symptoms : within days after becoming infected , a rash or itchy skin may develop . fever , chills , cough , and muscle aches can begin within 1 - 2 months of infection . most people have no symptoms at this early phase of infection . eggs travel to the liver or pass into the intestine or bladder . rarely , eggs are found in the brain or spinal cord and can cause seizures , paralysis , or spinal cord inflammation . for people who are repeatedly infected for many years , the parasite can damage the liver , intestines , lungs , and bladder . the symptoms of schistosomiasis are caused by the body 's reaction to the eggs , not by the worms themselves . anyone travelling to areas where schistosomiasis occurs and whose skin comes in contact with fresh water from canals , rivers , streams , or lakes , is at risk of getting schistosomiasis . if someone does develop any of the symptoms after visiting one or more of the countries where schistosomiasis is found and was in contact with fresh water , they should go immediately to their doctor and describe in detail where and for how long they travelled and that they may have been exposed to contaminated water . they will need to provide a stool or urine sample for analysis to see if you the parasites are present . a blood test has also been developed but there should be a six to eight week interval after the last exposure to contaminated water before the blood sample is taken . prevention : avoid swimming or wading in fresh water when you are in countries in which schistosomiasis occurs . swimming in the ocean and in chlorinated swimming pools is generally thought to be safe . drink safe water . because there is no way to make sure that water coming directly from canals , lakes , rivers , streams or springs is safe , you should either boil water for 1 minute or filter the water before drinking it . boiling water for at least 1 minute will kill any harmful parasites , bacteria , or viruses present . iodine treatment alone will not guarantee that water is safe and free of all parasites bath water should be heated for 5 minutes at 65 degrees celsius . water held in a storage tank for at least 48 hours should be safe for showering . vigorous towel drying after an accidental , very brief water exposure may help to prevent the schistosoma parasite from penetrating the skin but you should not rely on vigorous towel drying to prevent schistosomiasis . there is no vaccine available . treatment : a safe and effective treatment of schistosomiasis is available . praziquantel is effective against all human schistozomes . treatment is usually for one or two days and no serious toxic effects have been reported . areas of the world where schistosomiasis occurs:- africa : north africa , southern africa , sub - saharan africa , lake malawi , the nile river valley in egypt . south america : including brazil , surinam , venezuela . caribbean : antigua , dominican republic , guadeloupe , martinique , montserrat , saint lucia . the middle east : iran , iraq , saudi arabia , syria & yemen . southeast asia : india , bagladesh , central indonesia , the philippines , thailand , laos , cambodia , vietnam ( the mekong delta ) , southern china & japan . leptospirosis leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by bacteria of the genus leptospira . it affects humans and animals and causes a wide range of symptoms , including high fever , severe headache , chills , muscle aches , and vomiting , and may include , red eyes , abdominal pain , diarrhea , or a rash although some infected persons may have no symptoms at all . if the disease is not treated , then kidney damage , meningitis liver failure , respiratory distress and even death may result . outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to water contaminated with the urine of infected animals . many different kinds of animals carry the bacteria such as cattle , pigs , horses , dogs , rodents , and wild animals . humans become infected through contact with water , food , or soil containing urine from these infected animals . this may happen by swallowing contaminated water or through cuts and contact with broken skin . the disease is not spread from person to person . the incubation period is anything from two days to four weeks . the illness usually begins abruptly with fever and other symptoms . leptospirosis may occur in two phases ; after the first phase , with fever , chills , headache , muscle aches , vomiting , or diarrhoea , the patient may recover for a time but become ill again . if a second phase occurs , it is more severe ; the person may have kidney or liver failure or meningitis . this phase is also called weil 's disease . diagnosis of leptospirosis is confirmed by laboratory testing of a blood or urine sample . leptospirosis occurs worldwide but is most common in temperate or tropical climates . it is an occupational hazard for many people who work with animals , such as farmers , sewer workers , veterinarians , fish workers , dairy farmers , or military personnel . it is a recreational hazard for campers or those who participate in outdoor sports in contaminated areas and has been associated with swimming , wading , and whitewater rafting in contaminated lakes and rivers . leptospirosis can be effectively treated with antibiotics , such as doxycycline or penicillin , which should be given as early as possible in the course of the disease . intravenous antibiotics may be required for persons with more severe symptoms . persons who are thought to have symptoms suggestive of leptospirosis should seek medical help immediately . lassa fever , ebola & marburg viruses lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in west africa . the illness was discovered in 1969 and named after the town in nigeria where the first cases originated . the virus , a member of the virus family arenaviridae is animal - borne and is acquired from a particular kind of wild rodent known as the multimammate rat . in the areas of africa where the disease is endemic , lassa fever is a significant cause of mortality . while it is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 % of people infected , the remaining 20 % contract a severe multisystem disease . lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics , during which the case - fatality rate can reach 50 % . the disease is known to be endemic ( constantly present ) in nigeria , sierra leone , liberia , guinea and the central african republic , and there is evidence of infection in nearby countries including mali , senegal , and the democratic republic of congo . however , because the rodent species which carry the virus are found throughout west africa , the actual geographic range of the disease may extend to other countries in the region . the virus is shed in the urine and droppings of infected rats ( which are infected for life ) , and most infections arise through contact with materials contaminated by these . lassa fever may also spread through person - to - person contact . this type of transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with virus in the blood , tissue , secretions , or excretions of an individual infected with the lassa virus . the virus can not be spread through casual contact ( including skin - to - skin contact without exchange of body fluids ) . the virus is present in semen for up to three months after the disease begins , thus sexual transmission can also occur . it may also be spread by contaminated medical equipment , such as reused needles etc . ebola virus ebola hemorrhagic fever is a severe , often - fatal disease that has appeared sporadically since its initial recognition in 1976 . the disease is caused by infection with ebola virus , named after a river in the democratic republic of the congo in africa , where it was first recognized . the virus is one of two members of a family of rna viruses called the filoviridae . there are four identified subtypes of ebola virus . three of which have caused disease in humans . infections with ebola virus are acute . there is no carrier state . because the natural reservoir of the virus is unknown , the manner in which the virus first appears in a human at the start of an outbreak has not been determined . however , it is thought that the first patient becomes infected through contact with an infected animal , usually a primate . after the first case - patient in an outbreak setting is infected , the virus can be transmitted in several ways . people can be exposed to ebola virus from direct contact with the blood and/or secretions of an infected person . thus , the virus is often spread through families and friends because they come in close contact with such secretions when caring for infected persons . people can also be exposed to ebola virus through contact with objects , such as needles , that have been contaminated with infected secretions . the incubation period for ebola hf ranges from 2 to 21 days . the onset of illness is abrupt and is characterized by fever , headache , joint and muscle aches , sore throat , and weakness , followed by diarrhoea , vomiting , and stomach pain . a rash , decreased kidney and liver functioning , red eyes , hiccups and internal and external bleeding may be seen in some patients . researchers do not understand why some people are able to recover from ebola hf and others are not . however , it is known that patients who die usually have not developed a significant immune response to the virus at the time of death . there is no standard treatment for ebola hf . patients receive supportive therapy . this consists of balancing the patient � s fluids and electrolytes , maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure , and treating them for any complicating infections . the prevention of ebola hf in africa presents many challenges . because the identity and location of the natural reservoir of ebola virus are unknown , there are few established primary prevention measures . there is currently no vaccine that protects against the ebola virus . education regarding infection control measures to prevent the spread of the virus is paramount . unless you are travelling to an area where an ebola outbreak is occurring and you have direct contact with an ill individual infected with ebola , the risk of acquiring ebola virus is extremely low . marburg virus marburg haemorrhagic fever is a rare , severe type of haemorrhagic fever which affects both humans and animals . it is caused by a genetically unique rna virus of the filovirus family , and its recognition led to the creation of this virus family . the ebola virus is the only other known member of this family . marburg virus is indigenous to africa but the actual geographic area to which it is native is unknown , but could include parts of uganda and western kenya , and zimbabwe . as with ebola virus , the actual animal host for marburg virus also remains a mystery . just how the virus is first transmitted to humans is unknown . however , as with some other viruses which cause haemorrhagic fever , humans who become ill with marburg fever may spread it to other people . possible geographic distribution of the marburg virus after an initial incubation period of five to ten days , the onset of the disease is sudden and is marked by fever , chills , headache , and myalgia . around the fifth day after the onset of symptoms , a rash appears , most prominent on the chest , back , stomach . nausea , vomiting , a sore throat , chest pain , abdominal pain , and diarrhoea may then appear . symptoms become increasingly severe and may include jaundice , inflammation of the pancreas , severe weight loss , delirium , shock , liver failure , multi - organ dysfunction and even death . because many of the signs and symptoms of marburg fever are similar to those of other diseases , such as malaria or typhoid fever , diagnosis of the disease can be difficult , especially if only a single case is involved . a specific treatment for this disease is unknown . however , supportive hospital therapy is required . this includes balancing the patient 's fluids and electrolytes , replacing lost blood and clotting factors , maintaining their blood pressure , and treating them for any complicating infections . due to our limited knowledge of the disease , preventive measures against transmission from the original animal host have not yet been established . measures for prevention of secondary transmission are similar to those used for other haemorrhagic fevers . people who have close contact with infected humans or animals are most at risk ._. _ _ home > the bridge > december 2004 > developing links developing links by liz marshall liz marshall talks about how she hopes to develop links as the gsd representative on the association of women solicitors ( aws ) . i agreed to become a co - opted member of the association of women solicitors ( aws ) in may 2003 to help build closer links between the aws and group for solicitors with disabilities ( gsd ) . the aws and gsd have a shared interest in promoting the development of a more diverse legal profession that is responsive to the needs of its members and clients and more accurately represents the community that it serves . we have a lot in common so it makes sense for the two groups to work together to raise the public profile of equality and diversity issues and pursue other issues of mutual interest . however , there are some notable differ - ences between the aws and the gsd . for example , the aws is positively sedate by comparison with the hot blooded atmosphere of the gsd meeting ; there is no reed to shout above the noise of the crowd in order to make yourself heard ! but the calmer approach of aws members debating issues is matched by a strong commitment to representing the interests of women in the legal profession . another difference between the gsd and aws is that the aws has permanently established working parties focusing on specific issues . such as publicly . " the link " magazine and policy issues , that meet prior to each main meeting . this helps to move forward key issues on the agenda and is a good means of allocat - ing responsibility to group members according to their particular areas of interest and/or expertise . the policy working party responds to relevant consultation papers on behalf of the aws . such as the recent department of constitutional affairs consul tation on the reform of the judicial appointments system and the consultation on proposed changes to the law regulating cohabiting couples . this year . the aws and young solicitors group ( ysg ) undertook a joint research project into the reasons for women leaving the legal profession and failing to be promoted into partnership at an equivalent rate to their male colleagues , which revealed that many women still face discrimination when they seek to combine professional and family responsibilities . i hope that there may be scope for the aws to collaborate with the gsd on appropriate joint initiatives in the future , as they have done with the ysg . in the meantime , i will continue to keep the aws and gsd informed of issues of common interest . � the group for solicitors with disabilities , 2005 . terms & conditions_nnps _ _ calling all aromatherapists by carole preen - aromatherapy consortium administrator the regulation work towards voluntary self - regulation of the aromatherapy profession is now well underway . at a recent meeting the department of health stated that it is � generally supportive of the ac 's direction of travel � . concerns expressed about full representation are shared by the aromatherapy consortium representatives who highlighted the work being done to bring the profession together . the qca and skills for health said that they � would continue to involve the ac in developing national occupational standards and in the process of accrediting qualifications � and this would also include other professional bodies . a full transcript of these minutes is available on the ac website . the ac register this is a voluntary register of competence for all aromatherapists practicing in the uk and costs just � 25.00 per annum to join , the average cost of one treatment . the profession has agreed not to pursue statutory regulation at this time , but to concentrate on voluntary self - regulation first . this is why we need all aromatherapists to register themselves now ; to show support for regulation of their profession which will give us the strength to move forward . if we do need to eventually pursue statutory regulation as a result of pressures on the essential oil trade from european legislation , then all aromatherapists wanting to practise will have to be registered . � the more aromatherapists there are registered , the stronger the profession will be � many aromatherapists are already on registers so why do we need to be on another one ? this is a single source register that members of the public and the health profession can recognise as being the one to use when seeking the services of an aromatherapist . each association has its own register , but the public do not understand what the different letters mean and it is not always easy to know at what level someone has trained . gp 's also feel that they can not refer patients because the therapy is unregulated and they are not assured of standards of competence . this register therefore shows that the aromatherapist is nationally recognised as competent at an agreed standard ( nos ) . you will use � ac registered � behind your name as well as the initials denoting the association to which you belong , which will unify aromatherapists . it also gives us credibility and a single source for everyone to access when it comes to aromatherapy . this is not the regulatory register , it is a register to show support for regulation . the consortium 's role is to set the structures for the regulatory body , which will be called the aromatherapy council . by setting up this register now it helps us to set the entry requirements for the eventual regulatory register . it also enables you to have available the necessary paperwork to make your application for the regulatory register as straightforward as possible . what if i do not belong to a professional association ? we urge you to join an association so that you are then able to come onto the ac national register . you need to belong to an association , which can be an aromatherapy association , or a statutory regulated body , just as long as you are covered by insurance for aromatherapy , a code of ethics and are answerable to disciplinary procedures . you can find a list of associations / organisations who can offer you membership on our website at www.aromatherapy-regulation.org.uk concerned about how regulation will affect you ? regulation is for protection of both the aromatherapists and their profession and more importantly protection for the public at large . up until now it has been difficult for people to choose an aromatherapist because , as stated above , they do not know what the letters are behind their names and of course there are so many different types of training from week - end introductory courses and internet courses all the way up to full - time diplomas and degree courses . therapists have voiced concern about regulation costing them too much money and preventing them from being able to afford registering with different disciplines , bearing in mind that therapists often practice more than one therapy . the ac is working with other therapy bodies to seek to minimise the costs . registering now will help keep costs down as well as showing your support for regulation . why is regulation necessary for me as an aromatherapist ? in a press release issued by us as the aromatherapy regulation working group two years ago ( january 2002 ) it explains that � given the increasing popularity of aromatherapy , it is vital for its continued development that the public has confidence and trust in those who practise it and are offered the protection they expect � � � � we expect that a fully regulated profession will increase access to treatment , including we hope , through the nhs . � the aromatherapy consortium is the body that is developing the regulatory structure for aromatherapy and it is envisaged that once the work has been completed , we will be able to set up the aromatherapy council , which will be the voluntary self regulatory body for aromatherapy in the uk . it is envisaged that consortium can develop the structure for a council within about 12 - 18 months , so aromatherapists will still be ac registered under the aromatherapy council . the current register is therefore helping us to develop and pilot the standards , structures and costings for the eventual regulatory register . you can download the application form on our website at www.aromatherapy-regulation.org.uk or telephone our office on 0870 7743477 to request a form be sent out in the post . or you can write to us at : the aromatherapy consortium , po box 6522 , desborough , kettering , northants nn14 2yx tel / fax : 0870 7743477 website :_: _ _ this article originally appeared in the time higher education supplement , 2 june 1995 ' my brain ? it 's my second favourite organ , ' quips woody allen in his 1973 film sleeper , homing in on the central role that sex plays in human psychology , behaviour and , not least , reproduction . but what is it that brings men and women together for casual flings or lifetime commitments ? and why do the sexes so frequently misinterpret each others ' intentions ? david buss , professor of psychology at the university of michigan , reckons he can provide answers to these and many other fundamental questions about human mating . for buss , one of the leading lights in the rapidly growing field of evolutionary psychology , the answers point clearly to our evolutionary roots . our ancestors , he argues , faced many of the sarne problems people face today in attracting , keeping and sometimes discarding a mate . his central argument is that the sexual tactics that have been employed by men and women over human evolutionary history surface in our behaviour and desires now . this conclusion results from a global survey carried out by buss and 50 collaborators between 1984 and 1989 . the research led to a controversial book by buss , evolution of desire : strategies for human mating , which aims to show that what women want differs fundamentally from what men want and that when sexual strategies conflict , misunderstandings rapidly occur . men seeking casual sex without commitment upset women while women who withhold sex in order to get commitment and resources anger men . the book also explores the role of sexual conflict in areas such as divorce and sexual harassment . in an interview with the thes on a recent trip to london , buss explained that when he initiated the mating study , ' practically nothing was known about our fundamental desires ; no one knew whether the desires of people in the zulu tribe were the same or different from people in china . no one knew whether men and women differed in the fundamentals of their desires and no one knew to what extent they differed from culture to culture . basically there was a huge gap in the knowledge base for this area . ' his goal in setting up the study was to get as many different cultures from as many different racial , ethnic and religious groups as possible . cultural variations of mating systems - polygynous , monogamous - were eagerly sought . he ended up with 37 distinct cultures - large enough to make sensible conclusions - and a total of 10,047 subjects . ages ranged from 14 to 70 . looking back , buss finds it ' amazing ' that he was able to get the data needed . he was fortunate , for example , in having an iranian graduate who was so fascinated by his ideas that she volunteered to go to iran and smuggle the data out . data collection by a collaborator in an eastern bloc country - the study was launched before the fall of communism - started promisingly but was soon discovered by the government which quickly shut down the operation . the collaborator charged with collecting data on the zulu tribe was exposed to some very violent reactions . the basic findings of the survey can be grouped in three distinct ' clusters ' . the first cluster covers universal desires which show no sex differences . the key finding here is that everyone wants a mate who is intelligent , kind , healthy , dependable and a relationship where there is love or mutual attraction . the second set of results deals with desires that are universally sex differentiated . men place a greater emphasis on physical attractiveness or good looks . they also universally desire women who are younger than themselves . the size of the preferred age difference , however , varies . in largely polygynous cultures , men preferred women who were dramatically younger than they were by seven or eight years . but in britain , norway and sweden , for example , the ideal age difference was less . in all cultures though , men in general desire younger partners . for women , the key concern in choosing mates revolves around the male having good financial prospects as well as having the qualities that lead to those prospects being fulfilled - such as a man 's ambitions , industriousness and social status . women also universally desired men who were older than they were with older age being linked to greater resources . the third cluster of findings focuses on cultural variability , with the desire for chastity being the most culturally variable finding . cultures like the ( mainland ) chinese viewed virginity as indispensable in a mate , while people in countries like ireland and japan placed intermediate value on virginity . for the scandinavians , virginity was an irrelevance . as well as helping to provide powerful insights into human relationships from an evolutionary perspective , buss regards the findings as further evidence that the theories that have dominated the social sciences over the past 50 years are wrong . he explains that these have revolved around the notion that we are born with ' domain - general , content - free minds with general intelligence and general ability to calculate needs and relationships ' . these theories carry with them the implication that we are born with a brain that lacks the specific neural architecture to enable , for example , mating strategies to be executed . buss says : ' it is becoming more and more apparent that the domain - general , content - free model of the mind is wildly inaccurate and that what we have is in fact just the opposite . ' he cites research into the process of learning as lending powerful support for the ' scientific revolution ' that is taking place in our understanding of why we are what we are : ' there are some things , like food aversion , that you can learn through a single trial . there are other things that you can test thousands and thousands of times yet stili you can not get the organism to learn . so what that tells you is that we come into the world prepared to learn some things easily and rapidly but that there are other things where this is not possible . there is also the specificity of response associated with phobias and fears - there are plenty of people who are scared of spiders , snakes and heights but they do not develop fear of cars or electrical outlets . ' evidence of ' specificity ' is also piling up from fields such as artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience : ' in brain science , researchers are revising their models of the brain and in a way it is really satisfying because what they are ending up with are models that correspond exactly to what is being predicted by evolutionary psychologists . ' buss also points to the powerful conceptual framework that has been erected to support the empirical work of evolutionary psychologists by colleagues including leda cosmides and her husband jobn tooby at the university of california at santa barbara . the central argument here is that in order to solve an adaptive problem you need specific mechanisms to do it . buss cites don symons , a fellow evolutionary psychologist , who has said that there are no general solutions because there is no such thing as a general problem . buss often likes to use thc carpenter 's tool box as a metaphor for explaining this argument . saws , a variety of planes , a marking gauge , a mallet - these are just some of the tools a well stocked carpenter box would boast . one can not expect a carpenter to have just one tool to do all the tasks that are performed by all his tools separately . similarly , he argues , in order for us to be able to solve different adaptive problems , we need different solutions . conceptually therefore one should expect a variety of specific neurological mechanisms . when he first started publishing his results on mating strategies from an evolutionary perspective , they were met with outright hostility from quarters of the psychology and social science communities : ' the findings contradicted the dominant thinking in the field to such a flagrant degree and were erroneously perceived to be incompatible with the dominant political ideology among academics . some urged that i suppress my findings . i refused to do so . i am a strong believer in facing the truth , regardless of whether it is popular or not . ' buss says that his work is particularly upsetting to older scientists trained in an older paradigm . the sex study also inflamed a lot of people outside academia . he says : ' women get upset at the findings that men are so prone to casual sex , for example , because they do n't want men to be that way . but i say do n't kill the messenger . we need to confront reality so that we can deal with it . ' creationists , who are antagonistic to evolutionary theory in general , have been heavily critical of his work . and it also riles ' those who believe in the infinite plasticity of humans and have been brainwashed in outmoded ways of thinking such as all human behaviour is ' cultural ' or ' the product of socialisation ' . in fact , there is something in my work to upset practically everybody ! ' he says laughing . as for future research , buss is planning to dedicate the next few years to topics including conflict between the sexes - which he regards as one of the most important social problems of our time . he also wants to take a close look at the ' fascinating , complex and understudied ' field of status , prestige and reputation . born in indianapolis , indiana , 42 years ago , buss 's youth did not obviously mark him out for the heights of academia in later years . he dropped out of high school at 17 , totally alienated , he says , from his school , family and academia . at the age of 18 though he met a women en route to amsterdam who totally changed his life . during the three years they were together , he resumed school and went on to the university of texas at austin where he became enchanted with evolutionary theory . ' i went from being a terrible student to the top of my class and became a psychologist . ' he gained his doctorate at the university of california , ending up inventing a new technique for personality assessment which was well enough received to land him a job at harvard as an assistant professor . there he met other leading evolutionary psychologists including cosmides , tooby and martin daly . his own private life revolves around his two children from a previous marriage and his partner cindy . ' she is my soul mate . marriage is too pallid a concept to describe the depth of our relationship , ' he says laughing . one of his primary academic objectives is the laying down of firm foundations in the discipline upon which future researchers can build . he says : ' in social science , work tends to be faddish - here today , gone tomorrow . i try to do work that is important enough to stand the test of time and which will still be read and cited a 100 years from now . of the work i 've done so far , i think the study of mating desires in 37 cultures may end up qualifying .

" he asked me when had i started to pass blood from my back passage ? " god " , i thought , he knew about the time that i 'd run the neighbours cat over in the alleyway between the two houses . " what the hell are you on about ? i 've come for you to look at my foreskin , and disappearing manhood " . " so , your name is n't mr ------ " ? " no , it 's edwards . " " nurse " , he shouted , " err , we appear to have the wrong notes . " as i thought , nothing ever changes . once he had the correct notes he looked at the offending object : " aha , yes , that 'll have to be removed . " " er , under local anaesthetic ? " i asked . " believe you me sir , you do n't want to be around when we do that . " judgement day arrived . christine drove me to the infirmary for 8 . i thought , " well , at least it 's only day surgery " and the doctor had assured me that post operatively i would only feel uncomfortable for 5 - 6 days . why do i always fall for their bull ? the hospital had sent me a variety of forms , one of which i always refuse to fill in - and that 's the one on ethnicity , and disability . i 'm english that 's all you need to know . so the ward clerk was n't to pleased with me seeing as i would n't play her games . anyway , after several doctors had trouped through to see me , all standing there going um , yes , and disappearing . then the anaesthetist arrived , and asked if i would like a nerve blocking injection ? " yes . gimme some of that . " god i 'm a coward . anyway , i woke up after the deed was done to find my tail wrapped in a green gauze ; a bit like that green stuff plumbers use on pipes . the next morning the problems really began . not only was the pain excruciating , but yellow spots began appearing on the head of my manhood ( which , much to my relief , seemed to begin to come out of hiding . my manhood was finally being restored to it 's former glory . there 's a bit of a paradox here though , seeing as how my ' manhood ' had been surgically removed , if you get what i mean ) . later that day the district nurse called to see if all was well . by now the spots were united into one blob covering the entire head . " i 've never seen anything like that before . if it 's no different tomorrow i 'll phone your gp " she said . the following day the pain was so bad ( or i 'm so soft ) christine phoned the doctor , who arrived in minutes ( at least one of the few members ' of that profession i still admire ) .

" the restriction , in clause 56 of the data protection bill , makes the release of information about identifiable businesses or individuals an offence unless it is " for the purposes of , and ... necessary for the discharge of .... any functions under this act " . mr frankel said that disclosures to a journalist or even an mp will usually not be " necessary " in these terms , adding : " if they are not ' necessary ' they will be illegal . the prospect of committing an offence is likely to prevent the commissioner disclosing any information about such matters " . the registrar herself has said that the restriction will cause her staff " to be unnecessarily guarded in future " . under the government 's proposals for a freedom of information act , the public will have a right to any official information , unless disclosure would cause " substantial harm " to specified interests such as commercial confidentiality or personal privacy . the government has said that wherever possible existing legal restrictions on disclosure will be amended to bring them into line with this approach . mr frankel says the new data protection restriction " goes against this trend , not only by establishing a new secrecy provision while government policy is to remove them , but by applying its scope so widely and indiscriminately " . its effect will be to prevent the public obtaining access to information about the data protection commissioner 's work , even though other regulatory bodies will have to disclose such information . the government says the restriction is necessary because the european data protection directive , which the bill implements , requires that regulatory authorities be bound by " professional secrecy " . however , the campaign questions whether the directive requires such absolute secrecy , pointing out that it specifically states that " the principle of public access to official documents ... [can ] be taken into account when implementing the principles set out in this directive " . the campaign says that if there has to be a new offence it should apply only to disclosures which cause " substantial harm " to a company 's commercial interests , and not to any and all information about an identifiable business . the data protection registrar has herself questioned whether a new offence is required at all . the data protection commissioner will have a limited public interest defence to any charge of improper disclosure of information . but the campaign says this is drafted in extremely restrictive terms . the disclosure will have to be " necessary " in the public interest , not just desirable . and it will only apply if the public interest is " substantial " . the campaign points out that most of the bill 's public interest provisions - such as that which allows a newspaper to publish personal data , in the public interest - do not use the term " substantial " , and are much easier to meet . notes the data protection bill has completed its passage in the lords and is near the end of its commons committee stage . it implements the european data protection directive , which improves the protection given to personal information held on individuals . the directive must be in force by october of this year . the new act will replace the existing data protection act of 1974 which applies primarily to personal information about individuals held on computer . the new act will extend to some manually held records as well . the 1974 act does not prohibit the registrar from disclosing information . the government 's freedom of information proposals were published in a white paper last december ( your right to know , cm 3818 ) . the government has promised to publish a draft freedom of information bill for consultation by the summer ._. _ _ tales of horror and the supernatural -

colour " printing that comprises the majority of magazines and marketing materials you see every day . at some stage your rgb file must be translated to cmyk in order to print it on a printing press . it 's best if you do the rgb - to - cmyk conversion of your images you will have more control over the appearance of your printed document if you convert all of the images from rgb to cmyk before sending them to your printer , who normally will do a standard - value conversion to cmyk , from your rgb file , which may not be perfectly to your liking . it is worthwhile to take time to prepare your files correctly , as your printer wo n't be responsible for sub - par results when images are supplied in rgb . � although monitors always use rgb to display colours , the colours you see on your monitor will more closely match the final printed document if you view them in the cmyk colour space . be aware that it is possible to see colours in rgb that you ca n't make with cmyk . they are said to be " out of gamut " . what happens is that the rgb - to - cmyk translator just gets as close as possible to the appearance of the original and that 's as good as it gets .. so it 's best to select any colours you use for fonts or other design elements in your layout using cmyk . here are some examples of how various rgb colours convert to cmyk : rgb colours ( will look like this ) cmyk colours ( printing inks will do this ) rgb colours ( will look like this cmyk colours ( printing inks will do this ) you probably wo n't notice this kind of colour change in a colour photograph . it is more likely to happen if you pick a rich , vibrant colour for a background or some other element of your layout . it probably wo n't look bad , it just wo n't look exactly the same ._. _ _ when will blair go ? join the socialist unity sweepstake going ... going ... oh no , he 's staying ! when will blair eventually pack his bags and get out ? here at socialist unity we believe in celebrating the ending of rogue demagogues , so we 're running a sweepstake on when will blair go . but to make the moment sweeter we also want to raise money for no one is illegal one of the many campaigning organisations that are fighting the effects of blair 's neo -

bearing programmes and changes to existing programmes 1 the role of the faculty in programme developments the faculty scrutinises all new and revised undergraduate , postgraduate instructional and postgraduate research programme developments , along with developments at sub - degree level ( defined as levels leading up to , and not including , level 3 undergraduate ) . the role of the faculty is to ensurethat new programmes proposed are appropriate to the university 's mission and the school 's strategic plan , so that a wide range of educational opportunities is provided to meet the needs of diverse groups of students . . the faculty should also ensure that opportunities for collaboration across schools are identified , and that there is no internal competition 2 procedure for approving new award - bearing programmes schools must complete a preliminary planning information ( ppi ) form for all new award - bearing programme proposals . the submission of this form begins the consultation process between faculties and services which is required over all new award - bearing programmes of study . the full consultation process is described below . 2.1 information requirement the preliminary planning information ( ppi ) form is available in the section 2.1.3.1 . electronic copies are available from the educational development service while it is recognised that due to the early deadline for submission of ppi forms , the development will not necessarily have been scrutinised and approved by the relevant school committee or board , the signature of the authorising officer is expected to indicate that the proposal is progressing through the appropriate quality assurance processes of the proposing institution or faculty . ppi forms lacking such a signature will be returned to the school . 2.2 the consultation process the consultation process entails the originating school producing the preliminary planning information ( ppi ) , normally by 30 september . ( a ' fast track ' route outside this period is available when external deadlines dictate that this is necessary - see point 2.6 . ) the faculty will forward the ppis to designated contacts in each of the following , for action and response within one calendar month . each faculty ( feo ) each school chair of education policy committee chair of academic quality and standards committee business and community services ( for accommodation office planning department hartley library iss head of admissions and student data office , student services educational development service ( relevant eds link ) consultation and consideration of ppis within each group above is not a concern of the originating faculty . each group should ensure that no omissions have occurred in its internal consultation process . parties are encouraged to direct enquiries to the originating programme originator during this period of formal consultation and to refer to the paper ' collaboration and competition ' developed by the university when considering whether a proposal will create harmful competition . copies are available from the educational development service . 2.3 outcomes of the consultation process any party that considers that the proposal may raise issues of concern should express its concerns in writing to the originating faculty and school and copy the correspondence to the educational development service . this must be done within one calendar month of the submission of ppi forms , i.e. normally before 30 october . silence from a party will be taken as assent . 2.3.1 uncontentious proposals where no concerns have been registered during the one - month period of formal consultation , the originating faculty can approve the proposed programmes at its next meeting ( normally in late november ) . 2.3.2 contentious proposals if any party has registered a concern , the faculty will try to resolve the concerns informally , through discussions with the relevant parties . involving the relevant schools and the associate dean ( education ) of the objecting faculty . where agreement between providers can not be reached , the originating faculty may require further discussion between the parties concerned , before making a decision on the proposal . such situations should be referred to the educational policy committee for further action . where appropriate discussions may take place outside the meeting with the chair of academic quality and standards committee . 2.4 seeking academic approval faculties will inform the academic quality and standards committee of new programme proposals that have received strategic approval . while faculty and college internal academic approval procedures are expected to continue through the autumn , in parallel with the faculty approval procedure , the faculty will not normally scrutinise school proposals or college validation reports until the spring , after the new programme proposal has strategic approval . 2.5 timetable for approval in summary , the normal timetable for gaining strategic approval of programme developments is as follows : by 30 september submission of ppi form to the faculty , followed by circulation to faculties , college and services by 31 october deadline for recipients of forms to express concerns about competition ; early november cognate - area task forces consider programme developments in the light of any specific concerns expressed ; late november faculty approves uncontentious developments and takes forward any discussions where isssues of concern have been raisedp . early february academic quality and standards committee considers any proposed mid may developments still outstanding 2.6 late submission of ppi it is recognised that it will not always be possible for schools to produce preliminary planning information by 30 september , especially when responding to external agencies ' initiatives . in such circumstances , ppis may be taken forward using the above procedures and submitted to the next scheduled faculty meeting . 3 changes to existing programmes the faculty has an interest in significant changes to existing programmes where these might have a strategic impact . these include : i ) changes to the title of a programme of study ; ii ) introducing a new mode of study ; iii ) introducing a new pathway to the award . 3.1 information requirement it is not necessary in most cases to submit a ppi to the faculty for changes to existing awards , but written notice and rationale of the proposed change should be given to the faculty and reported to academic quality and standards committee . 3.2 timetable for approval it is recognised that changes to existing programmes can arise throughout the academic year from annual monitoring and programme review or initiatives of professional accrediting bodies . schools are advised however , to seek strategic approval as early as possible in the year . 3.3 the consultation process for changes to existing programmes , limited - scale consultation between relevant parties in the faculties and services as listed above may be sufficient and the faculty can circulate written notice of the proposed change . recipients are asked to discuss with colleagues the strategic impact of the proposed change and expressions of concern that may arise . the educational development service can advise proposers of the correct procedure for seeking strategic approval of changes to existing programmes ( see also section 2.1.2.8 ) . 3.4 seeking academic approval for changes to existing programmes , school internal processes and those of the faculty are expected to progress in parallel , to avoid delay . revised august 2001 , july 2003 june 2005 in the light of rraa and updating_vbg _ _ as the final stage in the art of mediation project , a second , more internationally focused conference was organised . the conference was aimed at a wide range of individuals and groups from policy makers , community and residents groups , members of the loyal orders , negotiators , politicians , academics and mediators alike and ran over 2 days , the 13 and 14 of november 1997 . the conference began with an evening session at which a keynote panel of speakers presented international perspectives on conflict transformation and mediation initiatives from a number of distinct regional perspectives and experiences . dr paikiasothy saravanamuttu began the session by highlighting the experiences of attempts at mediation in sri lanka . professor naomi chazan talked about the many difficulties which faced mediators in the arab israeli conflict as well as highlighting the needs of a reconciliation process and the techniques of mediation which must be involved . professor adel safty presented some examples of mediation from the middle east experience and considered the linkages between leadership and mediation and finally giandomenico picco spoke of his own personal experiences as a mediator for the united nations . the following is a summary of the main points of their papers . the sri lankan ethnic conflict dr paikiasothy saravanamuttu , centre for policy alternatives , colombo , sri lanka 1 dr saravanamuttu began by highlighting the fact that there have not been many attempts made at mediation between the parties in sri lanka and , in fact , the one initiative which was partly attempted ended in failure . as a result of this failure , subsequent mediation efforts and views on mediation in the country have not been positive . however , the main problem with mediation in sri lanka appears to be that the principle protagonists to the conflict still see the use of force as their most potent tool . they are not , therefore , at a stage where they feel mediation is either effective or necessary . there are also few local actors who can act as mediators in this context . in sri lanka the very notion of mediation is deemed ' foreign ' and it is actually foreign external mediators who have become involved in any mediative attempts . this involvement carries with it its own emotional baggage which must be dealt with in the first instance . the one example of mediation which occurred in sri lanka took place in 1987 when india intervened in an attempt to solve the conflict . however , this involvement was viewed differently , depending on the perspective . the sri lankan government saw india as acting out of of imperial design , while the tamil tigers perceived india as assuming the right to negotiate on their behalf . india saw itself as an honest broker attempting to bring together the warring factions . this intervention failed and the ltte resumed hostilities , targeting indians . dr saravanamuttu suggested that here was a significant lesson to be learned from this one attempt to mediate the conflict ; that mediators should not have had any prior involvement in the conflict ( as india had had ) . for mediation to succeed , the third party must be an actor from outside of the region . however , reliance upon external forces for mediation has problems of its own . governments fear that external interests will favour the tamil tigers and are thus suspicious of it . . there is a circularity about the issue ; although sri lankan are suspicious of foreign mediators , they do not seem willing to use local mediators to solve the dispute . in addition , there is a lack of local actors who can play a mediatory role in the conflict . as a result of the pervasiveness of the conflict , a diverse range of actors are caught up in the actual conflict , including religious leaders . the media 's involvement in the conflict is also perceived to be rather negative . furthemore , many sri lankans do not appear to understand the complexities of the conflict fully , partly due to the fact that it is mainly confined to the north and east of the country . this creates the added problem of attempting to develop a powerful peace constituency among the citizens of the country . the arab - israeli conflict professor naomi chazan , deputy speaker of the knesset , israel 2 professor chazan began her presentation with a brief description of the arab israeli conflict , highlighting its long term nature which was punctuated with intense violence on both sides . due to the fact that it is a highly emotional conflict , where two sides live on one land which they believe they both have an exclusive right to occupy , a certain power symmetry is created between the israelis and palestinians which makes negotiation difficult . a number of measures are needed before reconciliation processes can be effective : the political outcome must be clear . unless there is political agreement over the main issues , nothing else is effective . these agreements must lead to long term changes being made which will lay the groundwork for reconciliation between people on the ground . those involved in the reconciliation process can not exclude themselves from their own community - they have to identify with their own communities . some outline is needed as to where the solution lies . it is difficult to go into negotiations without some sort of political agreement between the parties . one should never negotiate over history . overcome the demonisation of the other . human contact and a personal involvement is a very important element in this . many initial steps of negotiation are informal and secret but they are meaningless unless the participants have some access to power . discretion is very important . be aware of media intrusion . you do not want to compromise your position in your own community . peace needs to be at the centre of the public agenda . keep it there . there has to be a commitment to reaching an accommodation . a full understanding that there is no alternative to building firm relationships . this is the most illusive quality . recognition must be given to the rights of both sides . the main elements which have proved necessary in the arab - israeli context : every israeli peace treaty has had third party involvement . it appears the protagonists need this type of intervention from another party . direct negotiations are needed . without this , the process is meaningless . non - governmental activity has been crucial . mediation and leadership professor adel safty , director , unu leadership academy , jordan 3 professor safty began his presentation by briefly describing the background to the leadership academy conference held in june 1997 when potential ' leaders ' from a wide variety of countries and backgrounds came together to learn more about ' leadership ' . he highlighted the differences there are in definition of ' leadership ' and the way in which the united nations university and the leadership academy deals with the concept of leadership , as a service to the community . he sees a clear connection between leadership and mediation , recognising that a mediator must have a number of personal traits including a clear vision , a commitment to certain values and vast amounts of energy . the leader acting as mediator must also possess credibility , be able to approach the fundamental causes which are inherent in the dispute and recognise the relationship of power which exists between , not only the protagonists , but also the mediators . mediating for the united nations giandomenico picco , gdp associates , new york , usa 4 mr picco began by explaining to the conference participants that he does not come from an academic setting , where mediation is studied and analysed as a distinct concept but is ' a manual worker ' who has acted as a mediator in a diverse range of settings . according to mr picco , the basis of success for a mediator lies in the credibility he or she possesses . complete impartiality is not necessary and it is a trait he has yet to find in a mediator . these two concepts are not irreconcilable and one does not have to be impartial to be credible in the eyes of the disputants . for example , the americans can not be seen as being impartial in the middle east ; they are part of the scenario because they can ' deliver ' the israelis . if they could not perform this task , they would be useless . the importance of the individual is tremendously important . institutions , history and religion do not rape and murder . individuals do . decisions are not made by institutions but by individuals and it is time to make individuals accountable for their actions . as an italian , mr picco looked on in horror at what was occurring in the neighbouring regions which made up the former yugoslavia . by looking back at history it was clear that serbs and croats never fought each other on the basis of their ethnic origin . this is a recently created myth . history has helped the process of mystification which covers the actions of individuals . in a concluding point , mr picco asserted that the most important lesson that a mediator must learn is that , if you take on a mediation role , you must also take on all the responsibilities that that entails . the challenges and complexities of mediation initiatives day 2 the following day , the main findings of the research into mediation of parades disputes was presented , and subsequently participants broke into working groups in order to discuss the issue of mediation more fully . the afternoon session consisted of two speakers , naomi chazan and pakiasothy saravanamuttu , who both responded to the research and provided their own insights into the differences and similarities between the situations in their own countries , israel / palestine and sri lanka . the following is a synopsis of their presentations . professor naomi chazan respondent from the middle east firstly , i wish to begin by making a preliminary comment about my following response to the report on mediation of parades disputes in the northern ireland context . i do not intend to give any advice , rather i hope to highlight the importance of comparative politics which lies , not only in finding the similarities between conflicts , but often more importantly , in highlighting the differences . therefore , this response takes the form of an exercise in a comparative analysis of differences . definition the first major difference relates to an issue hinted at in the morning sessions - definition . the term mediation has been used in the report in ways that i associate with other terms and not necessarily with mediation . in some instances the way it has been presented relates more to arbitration . to my mind the major differences between mediation and arbitration is that arbitration is binding . arbitration is a decision - making exercise , mediation is not necessarily so . therefore , to confuse arbitration and mediation is not helpful . i prefer precision to fuzziness . i have also found that sometimes mediation had been used in the report to refer to facilitation . mediation is not facilitation . facilitation means getting different sides together , but not doing their job for them . there is a great deal of difference between facilitation and mediation . frankly , therefore the first difference i have found is in terminology . as an academic , terminology is tremendously important , as practitioners like to know what they are doing . i think essentially in northern ireland you are doing all of the above - mediation , negotiation , facilitation , arbitration . however , each one has a different outcome . tone . i have been following the conflict in northern ireland from afar and i do not know enough about it . however , i can comment on tone . when we , in the middle east , discuss politics and are at odds with each other we are very nasty , very rude and very provocative . we can kill each other with words . you are so polite here it is amazing . i listen to the words behind the tone and find it is so different from what i am used to . i am not sure which tone is better , however , i am pinpointing the fact that there is a difference . i have always found that tone is an integral part of conflict resolution . sometimes yelling and screaming at each other is very helpful , as it means that you are not doing other things which can be much more destructive . sometimes if you are overly polite it may lead you to actions which are far less acceptable . there is , as far as i can see , a major difference in tone between northern ireland and the middle east . predicable and communal having followed the discussions over parades it seems to me that they are one of the most ritualised forms of conflict i have ever seen . it is a conflict focus which is totally outside of my experience , for two major reasons . firstly , our problems come up when we are least expecting them , rarely where we know they are going to happen . while i listened to the presentation this morning i was nearly envying you because you know where the conflict is going to happen and i do not . there is a large measure of predictability to the parades disputes , to my mind . the second major difference is in the form or type of the disputes . the parades disputes immediately makes the dispute a communal dispute and not necessarily a political one , even though everyone talks about politics in northern ireland . in my rather naive mind , communal disputes are identity disputes and sometimes involve identity confusion . i can understand this very well because , for fifty years as an israeli , i had the luxury of knowing exactly who i was because i could define the enemy very precisely . when the peace process began in our area i found myself , both personally and in society , for the first time in fifty years having to define myself in terms of myself and not in terms of an enemy . we are beginning to experience communal disputes within israel that we did not have to deal with before because we never had to look in the mirror and wonder who we are , where do we want to go , or what the values are that guide us . identity crises are the most painful problem that i have experienced ; more painful than trying to overcome conflict with palestinians . prevention or alternatives ? a lot of the activity around the parades disputes , be it arbitration , facilitation or mediation is about prevention - nothing more . for me prevention is almost the last thing that i devote a lot of effort to , because i know very clearly in israel what failure means . failure means violence , failure means conflict . therefore , i do not engage in trying to prevent this by putting it on the table ; i try to find alternatives to it because that is a constructive endeavour for me . i know this is a painful point but it seem to me that in northern ireland you spent an enormous amount of time and energy on prevention . i am not sure which way is right - to put your energy into prevention or to put your energy into alternatives . however , i do sense this as a big difference between our experience and your experience . in israel i feel that we may be better at providing an alternative political vision . for many years people compared south africa , palestine - israel and northern ireland . these comparisons have filled libraries and have provided many with successful academic careers , tenure and more . the comparison has always been there . nobody who has been making the comparison has been unclear about two of the three problems in terms of political solutions . it south africa it has been clear for many years that the political solution would lie in a democratic , multi - ethnic , multi - racial state . the question was how to overcome apartheid and achieve a fully democratic , representational , integrationist solution . in the arab - israeli situation there is no one who has seriously dealt with the conflict who does not understand that the political solution in our region is separation , the precise opposite of the political solution in south africa . in the arab - israeli conflict we are trying to find out how to successfully disengage so that we can interact in different ways . i am unclear as to what the political vision is in northern ireland . my hunch is that it is somewhere in the middle , between disengagement and integration . however , it is not precise and this absence creates a great discrepancy between the communal efforts and the political ones , because the communal efforts are not linking up to a political vision . it is very hard to constantly make an effort unless you are somewhat clear where you are going . highly structured . in many respects the groups involved in the communal efforts mediating the parades disputes are standard groups that have been known ahead of time , as well as individuals that represent them in one form or another . what i have found very absent , and for us what has become a crucial source of change , has been the introduction of civil associations which are not structured along conventional or traditional lines . for example , both women 's peace associations and professional associations ( such as business people , lawyers , teachers and nurses ) have broken away from the standard divisions and , by establishing these groups , have brought new organisational structures into the scene at crucial points . the civil society aspect , which is sometimes innovative for very important reasons , i find is absent in northern ireland , in many cases . it appears that the emergence of new civil associations which cut across standard divisions has been significant in israel and may be lacking here . civil associations deal with parts whereas traditional and religious associations are holistic - they have all the answers to all the problems and that is why they are very dangerous and complex situations . therefore , i pose the question : is there enough of a proportion of partial groups in northern ireland ? education and timing i noted this morning that you spent a long time talking about long - term education - either directly or indirectly . in our experience , in palestine - israel this is a chicken and egg question . political solutions are urgent ; they do not do not suffer too much delay . politics are never static and political time frames are very tight . educational efforts are long - term . if there is not some kind of alliance between the political timeframe and the educational timeframe , education for change occurs in a vacuum and therefore everything around defies what one is educating for . however , you know if you do not educate towards something else you will also face problems . it may be a paradox but timing is so important that we have to go very quickly in order to go very slowly and therefore we have to calibrate the timing all the time . even children relate to what is going on around them , so we have to make sure that what is going on around them is different , in order to make the education work . compassion and emotion we have learned that during conferences between those involved in the middle east conflict , be they israelis , palestinians , jordanians , egyptians or others , the first day must entail a venting of emotions . people must first be allowed to express their emotions before any serious discussions can be reached . this ventilation of emotions is , to my mind , extremely important because you have to recognise the emotions in others . i feel in northern ireland you may have a capacity not to do this . you may be right - i am merely highlighting this as a difference . the media the media is marvellous ; if it did n't exist we would invent it . however , the media is seen as a common enemy by all sides in a conflict who believe that the media is discriminating against them . a failure in our conflict as regards the media ( and i suspect here in northern ireland too ) is that the meeting points for real communication are very absent . the media does play a role in the conflict . i have noted that when the cameras are turned on in the knesset the tone changes , the language changes , the substance changes and the outcome changes . i am not sure if i want to blame the media . i am sure that i want to use it for my end . power vacuums you can not do without politicians . however , politicans do seem to lose their own personalities and become collective ' you ' . it is very difficult to do without politicians . we must raise questions about what kind of connections they have with people on the ground and how much they represent the people . if there are more opinions there should be more politicians to deal with them . i find in northern ireland a certain lack of connection which , for better or worse , we do not suffer from . our conflicts move , at least much more openly , from the personal all the way up to the political much more consistently than i sense here . dr paikiasothy saravanamuttu respondent from sri lanka i think a lot of what i am going to say is , in some senses , a reaffirmation of what professor chazan has already said , in terms of differences of contexts . there are a number of points that i wish to make : predictability an interesting observation made by professor chazan regards the predictability of the whole parades question . there is very definitely an annual symptom that you can expect which gives expression to the conflict and perhaps also serves as a barometer of the intensity of the conflict at any point in time . we do not in the sri lankan context have a comparable situation like that at all . there is no particular event that crystallises attitudes , which involves the community , where there is an expectation of violence , somewhere you can look to see an event played out , as some kind of gauge of the health of the conflict resolution process , on an annual basis . community involvement another comment i wish to make as regards the report into the mediation of parades disputes is that it does involve a fair amount of community involvement at a local level . there is , from what i can gather , at least a feeling amongst the community that this is something that does affect them very directly and that they have a role to play in its resolution . there is an assumption of empowerment which leads community leaders and local activists to take part in that process in a very direct way and indeed in some of the case studies presented , has succeeded . in the sri lankan case it this does not happen , for a number of reasons . the most important point which must be taken into account is the simple fact that we are a developing country in which the degree of empowerment amongst the people is very low . when there is a conflict or dispute there is an expectation that it is something for the government to resolve - not for those at local level . there is not the same sense of taking responsibility and affecting change at a local level and , in that sense , civil associations and civil society organisations do not play the type of role that they would get in the northern ireland situation . as a corollary of that , because you have this expectation that you must have either government or institutional sponsors to be effective , civil society can also be defined according to their partisan loyalties rather than have any space to manoeuvre it , to manage or be able to guide it into processes of resolution . in sri lanka , the independent civil society does not exist in the same way as northern ireland . the civil society organisations which do exist are involved in conflict resolution processes in a more indirect way , in terms of being able to earn their livelihoods , live on a day - to - day basis in a context of conflict . this existence requires them to ad hocly acquire some mediation techniques . for example , in an impoverished border village in the conflict zone in sri lanka ( mainly the north and eastern provinces of the country ) villagers often have to dig wells in order to get water . once they do that the well becomes a resource for that area . because it is a border area the army also has access to the well . as far as the villagers are concerned they need the water . on a day - to - day basis they are forced into a situation where they must negotiate with the army and the guerillas over the use of this resource . in dealing with these situations the villagers are making it clear that although the army and the guerillas are allowed to use the well , this does not mean that they are either pro - government or pro - ltte . in this instance the villagers are gaining a certain level of local empowerment on the basis of day - to - day existence . the macro or strategic issues , the political vision is something that psychologically is relegated very much to the politicians and they do notsee themselves particularly involved in that . political discourse in sri lanka at the present moment there has been a tremendous preoccupation at the highest levels with the whole question of the structure of the state and the social contract and the relationship between the majority and the minority . should we be unitary ? should we be federal ? terms such as asymmetrical , federalism and others are being thrown about and been accepted however unpleasant they are . however , this debate has a role to play in the resolution of the conflict . i do not see that kind of debate with regard to the conflict in northern ireland . i think that this might well stem from the fact that , at a local level , the sense of empowerment leads you to resolve an issue at a local level , as a self - contained issue . maybe in the case of sri lanka a lot of hot air is being expended trying to define what a federal state is , whether we should be federal or not , or what the relationship between majority and minority should be . whilst these conversations are taking place a lot of violence is occurring at the grassroots level between communities . perhaps our way of doing things may be more foolhardy than yours and yours might make day - to - day existence probably more manageable for people caught up in the conflict than ours . for us , we see very strongly an exercise in which all of society is involved in terms of wanting to change itself . the paradox is that you place a much greater role and responsibility on the politicians to be able to resolve this than at the community level . the church i have already made the point that civil society organisations do not have that sense of empowerment and consciousness of being effective that exists in northern ireland . a great tragedy in the sri lankan situation is that the whole society has been caught up in the conflict and there are some crucial distinctive features that prevent the obvious categories that have been outlined in the report , like the media , the church , religious leaders from being able to perform the role of mediators . there are 12 million singhalese in sri lanka of a population of 18 million . we say that we have a majority with a minority complex . the singhalese do believe that there is no other place on earth where singhalese live and can call their home . there are muslims elsewhere in the world , there are tamils elsewhere in the world , and closely associated with this notion is the particular type of buddhism that they practice . you have 72 % of the population , its religious representation , very strongly committed to a notion of majoritarian democracy . amongst the christian religions , there is a distinction between the catholic and protestant organisations . the catholic church is much more representative of the population at large , in class terms and is a much larger church . there is a perception that the catholic church is veering towards the ltte . this perception stems from the fact that you have parishes in the northern and eastern regions and their ability to be able to function arises from having to make certain compromises both with the army and the ltte . more importantly , the clergy themselves come from the society and from the population and therefore , they too are caught up and share perceptions of discrimination along ethnic lines . the anglican church , on the other hand , is disproportionately influential in sri lanka because it is very much a product of british colonial rule . in class terms it is much more influential and in economic terms and their position and perception of them is probably best illustrated by the fact that the last time the government of sri lanka negotiated with the tigers the anglican bishop of columbo was a member of the negotiating team . so that effectively draws lines in terms of public perception as to which side people are on . the media another factor which was highlighted in the report was the question of the media . it is very easy to slam the media but we can not do without them and they do not always do what you want them to . unfortunately , in the sri lankan case , the problem of the media is compounded by the fact that this is a conflict that , in rhetorical terms is fought in three languages - the language of the majority community ( sinhala ) , the language of the elite ( english ) and the language of the minority ( tamil ) . there is no attempt to support a trilingual or inter - community dialogue between them . you will have one publishing house which will have media organs in english , sinhala and tamil , and these organs often emphasise in their broadcasting and publications , sympathises , prejudices , biases , which will be favourable to that linguistic community . there is no attempt to have any kind of dialogue amongst them and as a consequence , the media too becomes part of the problem . external influences there are , at the same time , internal resources for conflict resolution or mediation , be it in terms of the kinds of symptoms or localised disputes or in terms of pushing towards an eventual political settlement . however , the record is such that nothing has happened without external influence . being a developing country with no particular global , geo - strategic significance , the reason why external influence will be so powerful in terms of mediation or facilitation is an economic one . the localised business community , having been bred in a culture of state control of the economy and only a decade since liberalisation , still relies upon the state to do things . our business community will bleat about the destruction of the war but will not take any initiative in terms of conflict resolution which they see as the role of the politicians . i have been involved in a couple of initiatives , trying to draw them in , but time and again , they come out with this argument . added to this , there is a small but significant minority of them making money out of arms and so they have a vested interest in the continuation of the conflict . however , is it the use of economic leverage to be able to establish to the government and to the ltte that going further will only be more destructive in terms of political interest and agenda . definition of mediation there is one other point in regard to the report and that is the broad flexible definition of mediation . at an academic level , it is tremendously important to be very particular about the definition of these terms . however , from a particularly conflict resolution point of view i sometimes wonder whether the fuzziness is helpful and constructive . in the sri lankan context , mediation is a dirty word because it carries with it at the connotations of intervention etc . we have had to use these words like facilitation . facilitation is seen to be particularly neutral and part of the members of the peace constituency at home ( and it is a very small band of us ) do not want to spell that out too much because facilitation is also going to involve the parity of esteem argument with regard to the tamil tigers . the moment that this is mentioned the champions of the sri lankan state asserted that there was absolutely no way they could sit around a table with a terrorist group . so , we have not yet been able to find a term that encapsulates all the apprehensions and concerns , but one thing we are sure about is that arbitration is definitely out because there is nothing to arbitrate . negotiation is possible , mediation is to be avoided , and facilitation should be accepted only as a last resort rather than as the answer to the problem as such . so , in conclusion , at one level yes you do have a conflict resolution process which does have a predictability which you can respond to . in our case we do not . as a half - serious point , the last week in november is the week in which the tamil tiger leader has his birthday and it is also designated martyrs week by the tamil tigers . the entire political and security establishment is sri lanka expects there to be a terrorist attack in this week . this has been going on for the last ten years . it never happens . all the precautions are made , and as soon as the week is over we relax them and then the tamil tigers strike . so , any attempts to impose a predictability have not quite worked out . what we have in our situation is a real serious attempt to restructure the nation and the state . that is what it is about . we are not dealing with the symptoms . we are trying to tackle the causes and my guess is that by a process of sheer exhaustion we might well come to succeed . notes dr paikiasothy saravanamuttu is executive director of the centre for policy alternatives . he is also a visiting lecturer in international relations at the university of colombo . professor naomi chazan was first elected to the knesset on the metetz ( democratic israel ) list in june 1992 . she was re -

day landings and the bravery of our soldiers , sailors , and airmen . i would like to tell you about an incident that happened not on the first day of the end of the war , but the last day of hostilities . at midnight in a german town of oldenberg , i was stood in the main street with rifle and fixed bayonet along with my comrades of the 21st anti tank reg , guards armoured division , on the opposite side of the road were german soldiers , also carrying arms . at the stroke of twelve the enemy laid down their weapons on the floor ; they were marched off to a prisoner of war camp . i was chatting to a pal ( smugger smith ) that is the name we all knew him by , a german gentleman approached us and in excellent english invited us into his home , at the time there was a fraternization ban which forbade us to speak to the enemy , we felt rather embarrassed but we followed him in to his house , he introduced his wife and we sat down in a very comfortable lounge . he told us that he was a doctor and that he had lost a leg as a tank commander in the africa corps , he returned home and returned to his doctors practice , after a while smugger asked if he minded if he played on the grand piano which stood in the corner of the room . i must tell you that smith was a professional pianist in civilian life ( he played for a very famous band ) , lou praeger was the bandleader 's name , he was a household name in the forties , i spent the most wonderful hour listening to music by beethoven . mozart , chopin and other composers . i must say our host was a lovely gentle person , that night i sat in my tank thinking , twenty four hours ago we were trying to kill each other , hating the very name german and now all i could think of was what a terrible waste of human life ( approx twelve million people dead ) all because of a few idiotic people lusting for power . when will we ever learn tom . the preston masher another treacle mine overseer 1866 posts posted -

( and this is the bit that worries me a bit ) uncontrolled astonishment and as it all sank in , hilarity . at first reading , he left australia on 25th november 1916 , arrived in uk 29th january 1917 . joined training battalion 30th january 1917 . to hospital on 20th february 1917 , discharged back to battalion 6th of march 1917 . crimed for conduct prejudicial on 12th march ; 7 days field punishment . 18th may 1917 transferred to 1st light railway operating company . embarked for france 29th may 1917 . 31 may 1917 to hospital , discharged back to unit on 1st of august 1917 . 27th of october 1917 back in hospital , discharged 7th november 1917 . sent to england on leave and the next mention is he is in hospital in uk on 27th july 1918 with a dose of clap picked up from ' a professional ' in glasgow . discharged from hospital 12 october 1918 and back in with same complaint on 19th october 1918 , discharged to staff of 1st adh ( australian imperial force depot headquarters ) on 26th april 1919 . on 12th october 1919 he went absent and was declared illegal absentee on 1st april 1920 . discharged 21 july 1920 as illegal absentee . also in the docs is evidence that he left a wife in australia that we never knew about . her entitlement to his pay was stopped on 19th february 1920 . it 's early days and i have only just read this lot . i suppose my prime reaction should be shock , he told me he had been at gallipoli ! he had n't even left oz then . but the more i read the more i laughed , there is something quite surreal about starting the day with a war hero for a dad and ending it with absolute proof that he spent most of his service in dock with the clap ! my reckoning is that there is a possibility he was in france between december 1917 and july 1918 but even this is uncertain ( there is a large rubber stamp ' forfeits ' that obscures what might be a date that could give a clue ) and we know that for part of this he was in hospital . so , not exactly a glorious war service but for all his faults he is still the father i knew and i just find it so surreal to find that all my perceptions of his life during ww1 have to be modified . the bottom line is that when you start to dig in the closet you may well find skelingtons ...... scg/11 november 2005 stanley challenger graham barlick view stanley@barnoldswick.freeserve.co.uk cathy supreme member ( 1000&#043 ; posts ) 1249 posts posted -

cultural contexts within which it occurs . the centre for the study of conflict is pleased to add this thoughtful and imaginative study to its list of internal publications . seamus dunn july 1999 contents introduction chapter 1 : research on sectarianism and children introduction defining sectarianism research on children and sectarianism in northern ireland critique of research on children and sectarianism conclusions chapter 2 : learning from research on children and prejudice introduction research on children and ethnic prejudice applicability of research on children and prejudice to the study of sectarianism and children in northern ireland conclusions chapter 3 : research on the contact hypothesis introduction current debates and controversies research on the contact hypothesis new directions for research on the contact hypothesis conclusions chapter 4 : towards an alternative methodological approach introduction the present study ethical issues validity of the data conclusions chapter 5 : sectarianism and children 's perspectives introduction the children 's experiences of the conflict protestant children 's perspectives catholic children 's perspectives developing anti -

to - day lives remain significantly influenced by sectarianism and the effects of the conflict ( smyth 1998 ) . it is not surprising that children and young people should provide the focus of so much academic and political attention . most fundamentally , they represent � the future ' . while there may exist a relatively pessimistic attitude towards the ability to mend bridges and resolve conflict among the adult population , children and young people are often regarded as less � entrenched ' and more receptive to new ways of thinking . it may well be because they are seen as holding the key to the future that some of the most concerted and sustained attempts at community relations work has been aimed at this age group . this is most evident in terms of the official sanctioning of community relations strategies at this level through the introduction of � education for mutual understanding ' and � cultural heritage ' as cross - curricular themes within the national curriculum . while the actual impact of these statutory requirements on schools has been variable ( smith and robinson 1996 ) , there is no doubt that they have at least contributed to an increasing focus on the need � to do something ' with children and young people in respect of community relations work . the most significant and widespread practical response to this perceived need has undoubtedly been the use of cross - community contact schemes . since the department of education for northern ireland ( deni ) first provided funds for such schemes between schools in 1987 , the number of schools participating has risen from 15 percent at that time to 45 per cent in 1995 ( smith and robinson 1996 ) . a similar picture also emerges within the youth service where it is has recently been reported that 65 per cent of full - time youth clubs , 32 per cent of part - time youth clubs and 38 per cent of uniformed organisations currently participate in cross - community contact schemes ( youth council for northern ireland 1998 ) . moreover , the same report goes on to show that when the use of single identity work is also taken into consideration then the clear majority of youth organisations have been found to involve themselves in some form of community relations work ( 85 per cent of full - time , 60 per cent of part - time and 68 per cent of uniformed organisations ) . overall , the effects of such work certainly appears to be encouraging with a significant majority of young people surveyed believing that � their involvement had resulted in a more positive perception towards those from other religious traditions ' and , for those involved in more frequent and sustained community relations work , they were � significantly more likely to have inter - religious friendships , and less likely to perpetrate sectarian bullying than those not involved ' ( youth council for northern ireland 1998 : iv ) . the outlook for community relations work with children and young people , at least for the foreseeable future , also appears to be extremely positive . in relation to schools , for example , deni 's current strategic plan for 1996 - 2000 underlines its own continuing commitment to � community relations work by identifying it as one of the four key priorities for action for the education service . as deni reiterate : schools have a vital part to play in strengthening the cohesion of northern ireland society . the ethos imparted in the school environment has an enduring impact . contact between pupils of different backgrounds will continue to be promoted through the cross - community contact scheme , so as to build respect for , and understanding of , different cultural traditions . education for mutual understanding will remain an important theme in the northern ireland curriculum . integrated schools also contribute to this important objective ( deni 1997 : section 4.19 ) . the recent publication by deni of a revised curriculum for youth work appears to afford community relations an even stronger role in relation to the work of the youth service ( deni 1998 ) . in identifying personal and social development as being the central theme of youth work , deni identify three core principles that should underpin the curriculum of youth work in order to achieve this . one of these three principles is the � acceptance and understanding of others ' . in offering a rationale for the identification of this core principle , deni argue that : it is important that youth workers appreciate that they are valuable role models and they have the potential to impart to young people the values of compassion , understanding and acceptance of others . by their example , they can do much to promote these values within their own units and can encourage the extension of such acceptance and understanding to other groups of young people within and beyond their local communities ... youth workers can not ignore the major features of life which , in the context of northern ireland , polarise and divide young people , allow them to stereotype and categorise each other , and lead many of them into direct confrontation . over the past 28 years , initiatives to promote greater acceptance and understanding of difference have emerged under a variety of community relations initiatives . this is vital work , if a tolerant and peaceful society is to be created . youth workers are often well placed to help young people to arrive at a better understanding of their own beliefs , culture and sexuality , to acknowledge and accept the diversity of their own communities , to challenge prejudice , and to pursue equality of opportunity for themselves and for others ( deni 1998:10 - 11 ) . interestingly , we have now reached a significant point in the development of community relations work for children and young people . deni has recently engaged in an informal consultation process with regard to its own strategic plan . this is hoped to pave the way for a formal review of the plan in april / may next , subject to the establishment of a ministerial executive as part of the northern ireland assembly . moreover , the youth service is , itself , coming to the end of a fundamental review of its future role and scope . it is not only reviewing the current objectives set for the service but also , more fundamentally , the age - ranges the service should target , how to include young people and the wider community more centrally in the service and how the service relates to other agencies and organisations ( youth service policy review 1998a , 1998b ) . the final report is due at any time with an anticipated policy statement by the minister in march 1999 . it therefore also seems an opportune moment to reflect upon and evaluate the contribution that research has made to community relations work with children and young people and to consider its future role . this is the main purpose of the current report . in offering a detailed review of research on children and sectarianism and on the contact hypothesis more generally , the report will draw attention to the continuing gaps in our understanding and will suggest alternative directions for future research in terms of methodology and focus . in then drawing upon data gained from an exploratory qualitative study focusing on the experiences and perspectives of 10 and 11 year old children , the report also aims not only to � model out ' a more effective research approach to the study of sectarianism , children and community relations work but will also offer some tentative indication of the nature and extent of the issues to be addressed . chapters one to three , therefore , offer comprehensive reviews and evaluations of existing research on sectarianism and children and on the contact hypothesis respectively . chapter four draws together the main implications of these preceding reviews and sets out the central elements of an alternative methodological approach to the study of sectarianism , children and community relations . it also provides details of the specific methods used in the present exploratory study . chapters five and six then provide an example of how this alternative methodology can be applied by offering the main findings of the exploratory study . chapter five focuses on the nature and forms that sectarianism takes among the children while chapter six offers a brief analysis of the impact and effects that a particular contact scheme organised between two respective youth clubs has had on the children 's attitudes and behaviour . finally , chapter seven , provides a summary of the key issues raised by the report in terms of both the general research approaches that have been adopted in relation to sectarianism , children and community relations work and the issues arising from the exploratory study with respect to policy and practice . the chapter concludes with a number of recommendations in relation to the implications of this for future research , policy and practice in the area . publication contents � centre for the study of conflict and the author(s ) last modified by f. mckenna : back to the top of this page_nn _ _ wherever you find a sacred well or mention of a well in a place name , it indicates the existence of ancient well worship . throughout the millennia wells have primarily been dedicated and rededicated to different goddesses of healing and fertility and tended by female guardians . sometimes with creative inspiration you can contact the essences of well priestesses in the celtic tradition in even the most neglected urban well shaft or pipe that may be the only sign that the sacred waters still flow . but occasionally archaeologists and historians have pieced together archaeological evidence to shed light on those who came to seek healing and fertility � and those who tended them in an unbroken tradition . the isle of sheppey in kent where water , sky and earth converge is perhaps best known for the heavy industrialisation of the surrounding river thames or the caravan and chalet sites that provide a haven for londoners . but local historian , author and archaeologist brian slade has pieced together the story of the sacred wells of sheppey and the ancient abbey , monasterium sexburgha and in doing so has come across evidence of the druidesses who once tended the sacred waters . other historians share his view that sheppey may have been the last remote stronghold of the old druidical rites in england . excavations and investigations , carried out by mr slade 's archaeological team over a period of ten years revealed that the anglo saxon st sexburga chapel , more than one thousand three hundred years old , stands in the centre of a former druidic ( and pre - druidic ) place of worship . the druidic site is marked what is called the minster triangle , formed by a trinity of extremely ancient healing wells . down all three wells , the archaeological team discovered artefacts that provided evidence of a triple headed celtic or even pre celtic fertility goddess worship . most significant was the discovery of a three - headed metal cast , depicting a heavily pregnant goddess squatting in the ancient position of giving birth in what is now called the well of the triple goddess . from similar broken beeswax images of the same goddess , also found in the well shaft , it seems that women once broke these beeswax images into pieces and dropped them in the well as a private offering to the goddess for fertility . local evidence speaks of an indigenous ancient goddess called brid or bridget in kent and of her later cross pollination with ireland 's st bridget , the incoming saxons , the abbess sexburga and her nuns , said brian slade , would have inherited and absorbed the local tradition of the strong fertility associations of the well waters . dr thirsk another archaeologist historian pointed out in 1987 how in kent there is a high concentration of churches dedicated to female saints and how they are often associated with reputed holy wells and springs in the area . this may signify the christianisation of pagan shrines dedicated to a widespread celtic/ pre celtic water goddess cult in kentt mr slade noted that the ancient references to sexburga , abbess of minster abbey , indicated that like the triple goddess brighid and the later saint bridget , she was also one of three sisters , all of whom became saints and so she was the ideal candidate to take over the healing / fertility wells and celtic triple goddess worship . sexburga likewise became famed for her healing powers and healing wells ; the wells continued to be a focus site of pilgrimage , especially for barren women throughout christian times . when in 640 - 664 ad st sexburga adopted the minster site , a number of her nuns , especially those drawn from the local region ( absorbed , perhaps , from a local priestess tradition ) may have been secret druidesses and in essence practical religious changes under sexburga to the former pagan well reverence were probably few . the most famous of the three wells excavated by brian slade 's team is sexburgha's / the triple goddess well within the old abbey grounds . since 1990 when the fertility image first was found in its waters , it has been credited with helping the birth of more than more than twenty babies , born to couples who were having difficulty conceiving or women who could not carry an infant to full term . in the first , and most remarkable case , when the well was first excavated in 1990/1991 archaeologist ian touched the fertility symbol while waist - deep in mud , without realising its significance . sharon , his wife who previously been unable to carry a baby to full - term , gave birth to a daughter emily in june , 1991 exactly nine months later she and ian went on to have another healthy daughter . though sexburgha and her abbey are long gone , the goddess / druidess links have remained . on a column , at the present minster abbey , built on the site of sexburgha 's old abbey and its grounds , is an image of a goddess with three wheat stalks , a fertility symbol . what is more the � s ' of the saint 's name appears in a triangular stone above the priest 's door in the sexburgha chapel , entwined with the image of pagan fertility god , the green man . the green man stands on a direct pathway / ley line between two of the wells .._. _ _ this article argues that the constant necessity to re - ink one 's pen provided the opportunity for scribal distraction at the level of eye , memory , judgement and pen , and would thus have been an occasion for the introduction of unintentional copying errors . this conclusion is suggested by writing practices in antiquity and confirmed by several striking examples in p. oxy . 657 ( = p13 ) where observable re - inking practices correlate with the introduction of new singular readings . i. introduction new testament textual critics customarily discuss scribal errors under two headings : intentional errors and unintentional , accidental , or involuntary errors . intentional errors are those made deliberately in order to improve or correct the text and involve corrections made to spelling or grammar , harmonisation to other passages ( whether in the immediate context , in a parallel passage , or in an old testament source ) , and liturgical or theological enhancement . these might all be traced to the conscious activity of the scribe . [ 1 ] unintentional errors , on the other hand , can be distinguished ( in theory at least ) as arising not from conscious scribal activity but from involuntary mistakes of eye , ear , memory , judgment , pen or speech . [ 2 ] these errors involve accidental additions , especially dittography ( writing twice something that is only once in the exemplar ) ; omissions , either by haplography ( writing once something that is twice in the exemplar ) or through homoioteleuton ( a confusion due to similar endings of words or lines in the exemplar ) ; or other sorts of confusions of letters or words . [ 3 ] in considering the causes whereby unintentional or accidental errors were introduced by scribes , scholars have often attributed them to factors such as tiredness or distraction , following jerome who referred to mistakes made by ' copyists more asleep than awake ' . [ 4 ] as the alands wrote , ' it is certainly no secret that a scribe engaged in copying a manuscript is susceptible to fatigue , especially when copying continuous script . ' [ 5 ] kenyon deduced from the extremely varied quality of scribal workmanship the truism ' that scribes are capable of anything ' and suggested that some mistakes ' are mere incalculable blunders of a wandering eye , of inattention , or of misplaced invention . ' [ 6 ] our aim in this paper is to document and support the suggestion that , in addition to the general issue of scribal weariness , another factor , namely the constant necessity to re - ink one 's pen , provided the occasion for distraction at the level of , at the very least , eye , memory , judgment and pen . we shall argue that such a suggestion is clearly plausible in general and that specific examples of errors introduced in the re - inking process can be detected in p. oxy . 657 , an early manuscript of hebrews . ii . pens and writing in antiquity throughout the greco - roman era it seems that scribes writing on papyrus or parchment characteristically used the hard reed pen ( greek : ka / lamov ; latin : calamus ) , with the point split into two equal parts to form a nib and constantly sharpened . [ 7 ] unless one needed the facility of easy erasure , for example in composition or school - exercises where a wax tablet and stylus would be used , [ 8 ] the reed pen was widely used . [ 9 ] greenlee asserted that ' it is safe to assume that virtually all extant papyrus mss . , both of the n.t. and of other documents , were written with a reed pen . ' [ 10 ] this assumption is supported by several accounts involving the procurement of writing materials . p. oxy . 326 , a letter ( of cca ad 45 ) about the procurement of writing materials , provides a list of the basic requirements , including ' the ink pot and the reeds and the pen - knife so that he can split the reeds for writing and the rubber ' . [ 11 ] the accounts of the record office at tebtunis ( ad 45 - 57 ) show numerous purchases of sheets or packets of papyrus ( at an average of 4 drachma ) ; as well as regular purchases of ink ( p. mich. 123 verso iii.11 , 24 , 25 ; v.25 ; ix.7 ; x.8 ) , and single purchases of a ka / lamov ( verso x.8 ; cf . rect xii.39 ) and a sponge ( verso ii.30 ) . [ 12 ] the main drawback in the use of such a pen was perceived by quintillian to be the problem of constant re - inking : ' it is best to write on wax owing to the facility which it offers for erasure , though weak sight may make it desirable to employ parchment ( membranarum ) by preference . the latter , however , although of assistance to the eye , delays the hand and interrupts the stream of thought owing to the frequency with which the pen ( calamus ) has to be supplied with ink . ' [ 13 ] other factors were also involved , persius flaccus ( ad 34 - 62 ) , in a satirical illustration of the wasted opportunities of youth , but which must presumably resemble reality , wrote : we now take up our book ( liber ) , and the two - coloured parchment ( membrana ) , well cleansed of hair ; some paper ( chartae ) too , and the knotty reed - pen ( calamo ) . next we complain that the ink is thick and clots upon the pen ; that when water is poured in , the blackness disappears , and that the tube sprinkles the diluted stuff in blots upon the paper . ... how can i work with a pen like this ? [ 14 ] the constant need for re - inking is also suggested in two wall paintings from pompei which depict various types of writing materials . in one of these a reed pen is balanced on a hexagonal ink pot next to a half unround scroll . [ 15 ] in another ( naples museum inv . 4676 ) a reed pen is shown resting against a double ink - well next to a partially written scroll . [ 16 ] the close association in the literature of the reed pen and the necessary ink , as attested in the phrase " pen and ink " ( 3 john 13 ) is significant in this regard . [ 17 ] the literary evidence suggests , following quintillian in particular , that the re - inking of the reed - pen could easily have served as an opportunity for distraction from the task at hand . in the next section we shall argue that several examples of this generally plausible suggestion can be seen in the re - inking practices of a particular scribe . iii . evidence for re - inking in p. oxy . 657 the best scribes clearly took care that the process of re - inking their reed pen did not adversely effect the presentation of their document . among less competent scribes , however , the gradual fading of the letters is sometimes followed by a dramatically bolder word or two . [ 18 ] in the early period very clear examples of this can be found in p. oxy . 657 , a manuscript containing portions of hebrews and dated to around ad 300 . [ 19 ] various lines of evidence suggest that the scribe responsible for this manuscript should be classified as ' non - professional ' . in the first place , an analysis of the manuscript reveals a distinct lack of discipline in column width and a wide variation in the number of lines per column , neither of which would characterise a professional scribe paid by the line . the available evidence is summarised in the table below ( in most cases the column widths have to be estimated by extrapolation from the extant width ) . column column width ( mm . est . ) lines of text height ( mm ) mz ( 47 = 1 in gh ) 135 - 140 27 200 mh ( 48 = 2 in gh ) 135 - 140 26 205 mq ( 49 = 3 in gh ) 145 - 150 25 195 n ( 50 = 4 in gh ) insufficient evidence 25 192 cb ( 63 = 5 in gh ) 150 - 155 24 205 cg ( 64 = 6 in gh ) insufficient evidence cd ( 65 = 7 in gh ) 170 - 175 23 195 [ ce ] ( 66 = 8 in gh ) 170 - 175 23 195 cv ( 67 = 9 in gh ) insufficient evidence 26 200 ch ( 68 = 10 in gh ) 170 - 175 24 205 [ cq ] ( 69 = 11 in gh ) insufficient evidence a further indication of the scribes ' non - professional ' behaviour is the marked deterioration in the writing in the course of the extant london fragment : letter formation becomes increasingly erratic and the individual letters increase in size , while lines begin to slope up at the end and the lower lines become longer . the scribe takes some care with the content of the text , as is clear from the twelve corrections he makes to single letters or diphthongs by overwriting or superscripting the correction , but he takes less care with the general appearance of his manuscript . [ 20 ] a careful survey suggests that our scribe needed to re - ink his pen at least once every line and possibly more often ( the edges of the manuscript have been damaged and so beginnings and ends of lines are often either not extant or rather damaged , hence most of our examples come from the around the middle of the line ) . a number of these occur at natural divisions in the text , often corresponding with punctuation marks of one form or another . the gradual fading of the lettering is followed by a very dark serious of letters which eventually tails off into faint lettering again . such an appearance can not be attributed to wear of the manuscript or preservation problems as there is no pattern to their location on the page . as our earlier discussion suggested the scribe must have very often had to stop writing in order to dip his pen into the ink and , having re - inked the pen , resumed writing . many dozens of clear examples can be observed in this manuscript . the following examples are of particular interest as they suggest a correlation between the re - inking procedure and the introduction of new variants into the text . the four examples are found in columns two and three where the re - inking procedure is most clearly observed , and are each extremely obvious , practically undeniable , examples of the use of a freshly re - inked pen . in the list below we note the beginning of the re - inking in bold type : example 1 . col 2 . line 4 ( heb 3.10b ) : aei [ pla ] n [ w ] ntai en th kardia autwn dio ouk egnw [ san example 2 . col 2 . line 6 ( heb 3.11 - 12 ) : ... thn katapausin mou : blepetai a [ del example 3 . col 2 . line 9 ( heb 3.13 ) : para ] kale sate eautouv kaq ekasthn hme [ ran example 4 . col . 3 . line 8 ( heb 4.3 - 4 ) : kos ] mou genhqentwn eirhken pou peri thv these four passages are of particular interest due to the fact that in these places evidence of re - inking coincides with singular readings ( readings attested in no other greek manuscript ) in p. oxy . 657 . the presence of unique or very unusual readings at the same point in the text as a renewed bold text clearly suggests that , at least for this scribe , the physical process of re - inking his pen provided the opportunity for inattentiveness when writing resumed . we shall discuss these in reverse order , as examples 2 , 3 , and 4 are fairly straightforward . example 4 . col . 3 . line 8 ( heb 4.3 - 4 ) : kos ] mou genhqentwn eirhken pou peri thv this variant involves the omission of the connective ga / r from heb 4.4 at the very point where the boldness of the ink indicates the scribe has re - inked his pen ( cf . ei1rhken ga / r pou peri\ th = j e9bdo / mhj ou3twj , kai\ kate / pausen o9 qeo\j e0n th=| h9me / ra| th=| e9bdo / mh| a0po\ pa / ntwn tw = n e1rgwn au0tou= ) . although a similar omission is found in some non - greek witnesses ( some vulgate manuscripts and the syriac peshitta ) , the correlation of re - inking and apparent omission should be noted . example 3 . col 2 . line 9 ( heb 3.13 ) : para ] kale sate eautouv kaq ekasthn hme [ ran this variant offers an even more clear cut example , one of comparatively few which occur in the middle of a word . in this case there is also an unusually long space between the eta and the sigma , consonant with the probability that the scribe has lifted his pen from the page . here p. oxy . 657 offers a clear example of a singular reading , para ] kale sate ( cf . na27 : a0lla\ parakalei = te e9autou\j kaq 9 e9ka / sthn h9me / ran ) ) at the very point of re - inking . the aorist indicative of p. oxy . 657 hardly makes sense in the context and loses the assonance with kalei = tai in the second half of the verse . once again we have a notable correlation between re - inking and the introduction of a singular reading . example 2 . col 2 . line 6 ( heb 3.11 - 12 ) : ... thn katapausin mou : blepetai a [ del this example shows that at a natural place to pause , as marked by a punctuation sign ( : ) ; after the conclusion of the citation from psalm 95 in verses 7 to 11 , our scribe has dipped his pen in the ink - well and produced a unique reading , blepetai ( cf . na27 : ble / pete , a0delfoi/ , mh / pote e1stai e1n tini u9mw = n kardi / a ponhra\ a0pisti / aj e0n tw=| a0posth = nai a0po\ qeou= zw = ntoj ) . this is hardly of great textual significance , as it corresponds to a standard phonological variation : ' there is a very frequent interchange of ai and e in all phonetic environments from the beginning of the roman period on , indicating the identification of the short diphthong / ai / with the simple vowel / e /. ' [ 21 ] although this last variant may be a simple phonetic error , independent of the re - inking process , the correlation between the bold ink and a singular variation in these three cases supports the suggestion that re - inking one 's reed - pen might lead to confusion or distraction at some level . our final example is more complicated , but once again the re - inking practice of our scribe is an important factor which must be taken into account . example 1 . col 2 . line 4 ( heb 3.10b ) : aei [ pla ] n [ w ] ntai en th kardia autwn dio ouk egnw [ san here p. oxy . 657 ( p13 ) offers a text differing from others at a number of points . this can be observed most simply in the following table : na27 p. oxy 657 ( p13 ) kai\ ei]pon , 0aei\ planw = ntai th=| kardi / a| kai\ ei]pon , 0aei\ planw = ntai e0n th=| kardi / a| au0tw = n au0toi\ de\ ou0k e1gnwsan ta\j o9dou / j mou dio/ ou0k e1gnwsan ta\j o9dou / j mou in his recent commentary h. w. attridge has argued , albeit tentatively , for the originality of the text given by p. oxy 657 here : ' although p13 may display a simple idiosyncratic corruption , it is likely that the process of making the text of the psalm conform to the lxx was operative and that the unusual wording is original . ' [ 22 ] in support of attridge it is undoubtedly true that scribes often conformed their nt text to readings they knew from the lxx . [ 23 ] nevertheless , the opposite case , that the readings of p. oxy 657 result from ' a simple idiosyncratic corruption ' , might be supported by the observation that the relevant line of script in p. oxy 657 contains two clear cases of re - inking which relate to the singular readings already noted : in the first , having writen planwntai our scribe adds en boldly ; in the second case the boldly inked dio stands in contrast to the otherwise universally attested de . consideration of this problem suggests that even if one took these two cases as involving accidental errors correlative with the distraction caused by re - inking , the implied exemplar for p. oxy 657 would not necessarily have reflected the text represented by na27 . p. oxy . 657 's e n th kardia autwn ( cf . na27 : th=| kardi / a| . au0toi\ ) is not a simple alteration but a re - organisation of the thought of the verse , so that the pause for re - inking corresponds precisely with the end of the clause ( for p. oxy 657 although not for na27 ) . one might argue that , having made that alteration , de would no longer make sense and so dio is substituted by the scribe . but such a view would necessarily attribute the text of p. oxy 657 to the conscious activity of the scribe ; if the variants reflect deliberate alteration this would strengthen the argument that conscious assimilation towards the text of the lxx is more likely that otherwise inexplicable conscious departure from it , and thus strengthen attridge 's case . for the purposes of our argument it is sufficient to note that the presence of indications of scribal re - inking in p. oxy 657 must be taken into account in the evaluation of the readings of this manuscript , that several cases exist where clear indications of such re - inking correlate with singular readings in such a way as to suggest that the re - inking process served as an opportunity for distraction , and that the peculiar character of this particular manuscript demands , in the well - worn but still fitting words of f.j.a. hort , that ' knowledge of documents should precede final judgement upon readings ' . [ 24 ] we are not by any means proposing that distraction caused by re - inking provides a revolutionary key to textual criticism by which every slip can be attributed to the individual scribe . our brief discussion of example 1 shows that no easy answer appears available at the moment . iv . conclusion the specific examples of scribal re - inking of the reed - pen coincident with singular and non - original readings observed in p. oxy 657 , combine with the mechanics of the scribal setting and the comments of writers cited above to support the contention we began with , that the constant necessity to re - ink one 's pen provided the opportunity for scribal distraction at the level of eye , memory , judgment and pen . just a note that after presenting a preliminary version of the findings of this paper to keith elliott 's textual criticism seminar in leeds , lionel north mentioned a recollection of a discussion between tregelles and tischendorf on the subject of pen - dipping . on 26.10.98 he kindly sent me a copy of the page in john eadie , the english bible : an external and critical history of the various english translations of scripture , with remarks on the need of revising the english new testament ( london : macmillan & co. , 1876 ; 2 vols . ) ; vol . 2 , p. 364 . this recollects that tischendorf excluded john 21.25 on the grounds that in sinaiticus it appeared to be written with fresher or darker ink . eadie reports : � when he showed the page to tregelles , the english scholar at once exclaimed , � o yes , i see ; the scribe took a new dip of ink after writing verse 24 th . � home [ 1 ] for examples see l. vaganay & c .- b. amphoux , an introduction to new testament textual criticism ( et ; cambridge : cup , 1991 ) 57 - 61 ; b.m. metzger , the text of the new testament : its transmission , corruption and restoration ( new york & oxford : oup , 1968 2nd edition)195 - 206 ; k. & b. aland , the text of the new testament : an introduction to the critical editions and to the theory and practice of modern textual criticism ( et ; grand rapids : eerdmans , 1987)284 - 286 .
