the bloods results . i thout something like that was an emergency . i 'm an artist , i ca n't afford to lose my sight . i rang a&e but they were no help . replies debbie - cumbria 07/04/2006 email : tigger112@hotmail.com hi di this is serious and if you ring the eye clinic at your local hospital and explain they should see you the same day . i am very very short sighted and at high risk of retinal detachment . two years ago i suddenly got flashing lights round eye when i moved my eye and i rang the eye clinic and although i had not been there for years when i explained i was seen within two hours without even seeing my gp . i had a virtreous detachment and the danger is that as it detaches it can tear the retina and that is the medical emergency as they can not mend retinas after so long- if you have any holes in your vision or black areas then please please go to a&e and tell them all this , let them know you know what the dangers are . i was lucky in that my vitrious detached without tearing my retina at the time but i had to go to the eye clinic every two weeks for three months to check on it . a year ago i woke up one morning and had a black hole in my vision in same eye , again one phone call and i was at the eye clinic that morning and i had had a retinal bleed . again had to have appts every month then every three months for a year to make sure all healed well . i was told the bleed was probably due to my severe short sightedness but the vitrious detachemtn the year earlier had probably weakened it . if you have had vitious detachement do not worry ifyou vision suddenly becomes patchy blurred as i panicked and rushed back to the eye clinic and was told that the vitrious had gone into clumps and was floating round my eye obscuring my vision . as can only happen to me it was the worst case they have ever seen and i am still as bad now as was when it happened . eventualy the vitrious will renew itself but this takes many years . i am terrified it will happen in my other eye the same because then i would not be able to drive but that s my problem . please ring your local hospital eye clinic . your optician was right to tell you to go to a & e they know much more about eyes that your gp ever will , my gp told me he had one day training on eyes so he always send people to the experts . sorry if this is frightening you but i am sadly very well informed of the risks with eyes because i was born with severe short sight . please let us know how you go on . di - lancashire 09/04/2006 many thanks debbie . vitreous detachment is definitely what i have although i haven#t even been sent to a specialist . i eventually got an eye test at a different optician this morning . i have no damage to the retina thank goodness . the blood test for temporal arteritis was negative . however , he has written a letter for my gp telling him i must see an eye specialist urgently to check the rest of the retina that he could n't see and i do know to get to a&e if i have any missing vision anywhere . right now the only problem is the floaters . i 'm being extremely watchful . when i phoned for the blood test results , the gp had n't made any further suggestions and unless i go in on monday and demand to see someone , he wasn;t even going to refer me . inga - notts . - notts . 09/04/2006 hello di , just a thought - have you had a change in your medication recently ? the reason i ask this is because just before christmas my g.p. prescribed different medication for me . within 2 days of taking the medication ( tramacet ) i had exactly the same symptoms as you . i described the big black ` floaters ` as huge meat flies crawling up the walls - especially on a cream or white background . i also had this cobweb effect in front of my vision . i could n't concentrate on anything due to the huge black floaters and dimness of vision . i went back to my doctor on december 22nd and he urged me to get an appointment that very same day with my optician . he told me to ask the optician to send him a report of his findings . i could n't get an appointment that day but managed to get one on the 23rd december . the optician sent the report to the doctor 's surgery . i was then referred to the hospital to have various tests carried out . i was told initially my hospital appointment would not be until june of this year , but two weeks ago i had an appointment with the eye consultant . after tests which lasted nearly 2 hours he came to the same conclusion , that it was the change in medication . ( incidentally on the information leaflet in the box of tablets it does say " can cause hallucinations " ) . that 's what it felt like to me - just as if i was hallucinating . i am now back on my original painkillers for spinal problems and the awful black floaters have disappeared . my doctor suspected a retinal tear and that 's why he wanted me to see the optician immediately . just a thought , that 's all . i wish you well . di - lancashire 09/04/2006 thank you inga but no i had n't changed medication . i 've now been to a very very good optician and i definitely have vitreous separation . there is no tear to the retina thank goodness but i do have a letter for my gp asking for an immediate appointment with the eye specialist . davyd - broadstairs , ( kent , 11/04/2006 email : davydford@uk2.net hi di , although i 'm a computer technician now , i used to be a technician at an opticians , where i cut lenses and adjusted frames for specs . the flashing you can see is certainly a sign of detatched or damaged retina , though it may be some other problem . it will pay you to get seen by a specialist as soon as possible . the ' floaters ' are caused by ' debris ' , ( usually proteins but in your case possibly caused by the trauma that may have damaged the retina ) , floating about in the ' gel ' in your eye , the gel can turn liquid as you get older and you notice the ' floaters ' more then . i have ' floaters ' but i have been told that there 's not a lot that they can do , i find them distracting . best wishes , dave di - lancashire 11/04/2006 i have now been to the emergency eye clinic and seen the specialist . ( i feel like i did 6 rounds in a boxing ring ! ) . i do definitely have vitreous detachment but no tear to the retina and have been reliably informed that it 's highly likely the other eye will do the same . yuk ! at least i 've been told what to look out for an i have an open line straight to the eye clinic if i ever need it . now all i need to do is persuade my brain to look past this octopus that 's floating around in my eye . debbie - cumbria 12/04/2006 email : tigger112@hotmail.com i know just what you mean about having to ignore the octopus in your eye . as i said in my earlier reply my vit detachment has left me with large clumps of opaque gel in my eye that float around and somedays it they seem much more obvious than others . as i have been like this for three years and no change i can reassure you you do get used to them . hang in there . di - lancashire 13/04/2006 i had to phone the doctor at the clinic today because since his examination ( very rough and painful ) i 've developed a sort of starburst effect at the edge of my eye but only when i shut my eyes or blink . like lines radiating out from the corner of my eye . i still have perfect vision so i 'm suspecting it 's oedema from his poking about in my eyeball . he really was rough . he was n't remotely concerned ; told me i couldhave a new appointment if i wanted but said it would be nothing important . i suspect he 's covering up . it 's been there now since i came back from the hospital monday . i only see it at night when the lights are on or i 've been on the computer . it does n't flash at all . it 's more like an after image and i have no more floaters or loss of vision . the optician told me to speak to the eye doctor but i 'd already done that . the corner of my eyelid is also sore ._. _ _ angela carter tribute hear orange prize for fiction shortlisted authors ali smith and sarah waters talk about angela carter at the south bank centre in london ?

" ( " commonly useful transport company for the sick " ) , berlin , w9 , potsdamer platz 1 . correspondence concerning the killing of children went through the " reichsausschuss zur wissenschaftlichen erfassung von erb- und anlagebedingten schweren leiden " ( " realm committee for the scientific approach to severe illness caused by heredity or constitution " ) , berlin - frohnau , enkircher strasse 13 and berlin w9 , postschliessfach 101 . the chairman of the latter organisation was dr. richard von hegener , berlin - sch � neberg , apostel paulusstr 1 . the victims selected for killings were carted off at night from the freight station in freight cars by torchlight by the s.s. men dispatched for the purpose . relatives of patients were told that they were transported to another institution " which is not known to us " and were told to wait for further communications or to write to the " transport company for the sick " . after four weeks they were usually notified that the patient died from appendicitis or a stroke and that the body was burned because of " danger of infection " . of the people responsible for the killings , dr. von braunm � hl holds the former director of the state hospital for the insane in eglfing , dr. hermann pfannm � ller , as most directly responsible , although he acted in the name of the bavarian ministry of the interior . dr. von braunm � hl emphasizes that dr. pfannm � ller is a brutal fellow who actually enjoyed to dispatch patients to their death . he used to refer to newly admitted patients as " new chunks of meat " . dr. von braunm � hl stated that he considered dr. valentin faltlhauser , director of the institution for the mentally sick in kaufbeuren , an equally bad type . dr. falthauser did most of the killing on his own premises and even had a private crematorium installed , similar to the crematoriums in concentration camps . dr. von braunm � hl considers both dr. pfannm � ller and dr. falthauser as war criminals and he recommended that they should be tried . the trial should preferably be by a joint american and bavarian commission , because dr. von braunm � hl is a very patriotic bavarian and feels that the people of bavaria would like to express their abhorrence of the practices imposed upon them during their period of tyrannic domination by the nazis . dr. von braunm � hl also expressed the desire that if the american authorities gave any publicity to these matters it should first of all be given to kaufbeuren and only later and as little as possible to eglfing , because he felt that too much publicity focused on eglfing would interfere with the confidence of the public in the type of treatment available at eglfing , which he hoped to establish on the highest possible standards as soon as he took over as its new director . he also felt that since he turned over on his own initiative most of the evidence , that some consideration should be shown to his institution . i told dr. von braunm � hl that i could not make any binding promises in that direction , but i would communicate his point of view to the c.i.c authorities , with whom the final decision would rest . when i turned over the information to the c.i.c investigator , captain barbour of the 9th air force , on the next day ( 4 june 1945 ) , after i had deposited the documents at the 7th army document center , i did transmit dr. von braunm � hl � s views but left it entirely up to c.i.c to act according to their policies in regard to whether or not they wanted to " play ball " with dr. von braunm � hl . dr. von braunm � hl then went on to say that dr. pfannm � ller was now a prisoner of the allies and that he had been held in a camp at f � rstenfeldbruck . however , he learned later that he was recently transferred to a nearby german hospital because of abdominal pain . of other people responsible for the killings , dr. von braunm � hl named professor dr. walter schultze , the departmental director of the bavarian ministry of the interior . other organizers of the killings were professor heyde in w � rzburg and professor carl schneider in heidelberg . dr. von braunm � hl stated that dr. pfannm � ller and dr. schultze could probably name some more of the higher - ups in berlin who were responsible . the killings of children were carried out in a special section of the children � s department at eglfing . the most popular substance used for the killing was " modiscop " , which was a preparation manufactured in vienna and widely used as an anaesthetic in vienna , where it had been found to be quite toxic for children . when the lists , including documents , were looked over with dr. von braunm � hl it was found that 275 children were listed , 213 of which were killed on " authorization " . from the documents it became evident that all patients transported away for killing after 20 september 1940 were non - jews . a letter written by dr , pfannm � ller on that date reported gleefully that his institution for the insane was now free of jews , except for one czechoslovakian jew who was soon to be transferred to the protectorate of bohemia and moravia . the number of non - jews killed during the first 9 months of the killing up to 20 september 1940 , was 469 . during the second period of 9 months , after completion of the killing of the jews , 1,388 non - jews were killed . it is obvious from these figures that the killing of non - jews was greatly increased after the jews had been exterminated . as an illustration of the great secrecy in which the killings were carried out , dr. von braunm � hl pointed to the fact that even county officials and mayors of towns were merely told that the patient had been transferred to an institution of unknown location , and were referred for further information to the above named transport company . as stated above , the documents which dr. von braunm � hl gave me were turned over by me to the 7th army doc . ctr on 4 june 1945 , where they were discussed with captain barbour , 9th air force , the officially designated c.i.c investigator . due to the co - operation of lt . holger hagen of the 7th army document center , microfilms of the documents were prepared which are included in this report as appendices to the following chapter , in which the documents obtained from dr. pfannm � ller � s secret file are discussed and described in further detail . 2 . information derived from dr. hermann pfannm � ller � s secret file the documents found in dr. pfannm � ller � s secret file can be divided into five groups : documents concerning the killing of adult patients of the heil- und pflegeanstalt ( " cure and care institution " , ie . state hospital for mental and nervous diseases ) at eglfing - haar . documents concerning expert opinions which dr. pfannm � ller gave on patients selected for killing in other institutions . documents concerning killing of children at the heil - und pflegeanstalt - eglfing - haar . documents concerning killer personnel selected for the children � s department at the state hospital in eglfing - haar . letters to relatives , government agencies , banks , insurance companies and welfare agencies concerning people who had been killed . looking over these documents one finds that no direct reference to killing was ever made ; that the matter in general was veiled with an air of secrecy in which reference was made to certain meetings and agreements . the killing of children was frequently referred to as " treatment " , " intensive treatment " , or " treatment with all means of medical science " . equally non - committal were the fanciful names of all kinds of organizations whose sole purpose was the killing of the mentally sick , but which went under high sounding names such as " gemeinn � tzige krankentransport g.m.b . h " , " reichsareitagemeinschaft der heil- und pflegeanstalten " , and " reichsausschuss zur wissenschaft - lichen erfassung von erb - und anlagebedingten schweren leiden " . ( 1 ) . documents concerning the killing of adult patients of the heil - und pflegeanstalt ( " cure and care institution " , ie . state hospital for mental and nervous diseases ) at eglfing - haar . the removal of adult patients to killing centers was initiated by a letter from dr. schultze of the health department of the bavarian ministry of the interior in munich , dated 8 january 1940 ( appendix i , no.1 ) . in this letter dr. schultze stated that at least 200 patients � beds should be emptied at eglfing - haar , that the " reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft der heil - und pflegeanstalten " had agreed to take over the patients and that the first transport would be called for within the next few days by the " gemeinn � tzige krankentransport g.m.b . h. " . the letter went on to say that those responsible for paying the costs should be informed that further payments are not to be made for the time being , until the relatives would be notified from the admitting institution after the transfer . the first transport , consisting of 25 male patients , was dispatched on 18 january 1940 ( appendix i , no.2 ) , and signed for by a representative of the transport company by name of vorberg ( appendix i , no.3 ) . this receipt and subsequent similar receipts refer to a special decision of the health department of the state ministry of the interior of 8 january 1940 . the second transport , consisting of 22 women , was dispatched on 20 january 1940 ( appendix i , no.4 ) and was signed for by the same representative of the said transport company ( appendix i , no.5 ) . the third transport , consisting of 47 women , was dispatched on 6 february 1940 ( appendix i , no.6 ) and signed for by another representative of the " gemeinn � tzige krankentransport g.m.b . h. " , by name of schweninger ( appendix i , no . 7 ) . the fourth transport consisting of 70 men , was dispatched on 10 may 1940 ( appendix i , no.8 ) . this transport list was more elaborate than the previous ones in that a special column headed � remarks � was added . the point covered in the � remarks � was the question as to whether the patient received visitors or not . most of the patients included in this list received visitors only rarely ; a few of them received visitors weekly or monthly . the inclusion of that column definitely indicated concern about the feelings of the relatives of the patients selected for the killing . apparently the only thing that might have saved the patients was daily visits . this fourth transport was signed for by another representative of the transport company , by name of lothar stuhl ( appendix i , no.9 ) . all together , up to 20 june 1941 , when the last transport was dispatched , 20 transports were sent during the 18 months during which this system was in effect . transports were at fairly regular intervals . the number of patients varied between 12 - 149 per trip . by 20 september 1940 , within the first nine months of carrying out of this policy , a total of 469 patients had been dispatched . this number includes only one jewish victim . the number of jews dispatched up to that period is not obtainable from the documents in our hands , but it appears that one collective transport of jewish victims was dispatched to lublin on 20 september 1940 , but no list of that transport is extant . however , letters answering inquiries about these jewish patients and referring to 31 different people were found in dr. pfannm � ller � s files . none of the names of these victims are included in the transport lists found , hence it is obvious that there must have been a separate transport list for jewish patients , which has not been retrieved . on 20 september 1940 , however , dr. pfannm � ller sent a letter to the bavarian state ministry of the interior , health department , theatinerstrasse , in munich ( appendix i , no.10 ) . a translation of this letter follows : " subject : transfer of mentally diseased jews " " refers to the decision of the ministry of 4 september 1940 , no . 5236 a 44 ) : " inclosures : 1 list of jewish men 1 list of jewish women " in execution of the above decision , i am herewith submitting a list of all those patients institutionalized in the state hospital at eglfing - haar , who are full jews of german or polish nationality or stateless jews . " the institutionalized jews enumerated in the enclosed lists were transferred to a collective institution on 20 september 1940 by the geminn � tzige krankentransport g.m.b . h. berlin . i hereby report to the state ministry that from now on my institution harbors only mentally diseased aryans . in the future i shall decline admission of mentally diseased full jews . " in my institution there remains only one mentally diseased full jew , whose home is in the protectorate of bohemia and moravia , and whose transfer into an institution of the protectorate should be initiated as soon as possible " . initialled : " pfannm � ller " the lists referred to in the letter were not as yet retrieved . in the later lists , the column indicating the frequency of visits to patients selected for killing was again abandoned and printed forms were used which merely gave the name , the number , and the place and date of birth , such as for instance , transport lists nos.20 and 23 , including 63 men and 54 women ( appendix i , no.11 ) both of which formed part of the twentieth transport dispatched on 20 june 1941 , the total of which comprised 75 men and 60 women . sometime in april 1941 , apparently , the news got around that people were killed in the state institutions for the insane as indicated by a note to the record ( aktennote ) concerning the case of a patient by name of maria mader ( appendix i , no.12 ) . translation of that note is as follows : " the mother of the patient maria mader , born 16.9.1917 , mrs anna mader , born rein munich , amalienstr 95/i , appeared today before the director of the institution and declared : � i request immediate release of my child maria mader to my care . in spite of all difficulties i want to take her home . my reason is that i have learned that people who are transferred from institutions die soon and that their bodies are then cremated . only the ashes are sent to the relatives . since i find it unbearable to have my child cremated , which is against my principles , i want to take my daughter home with me . at any rate i would like to take possession of the corpse of my daughter if anything should happen . so that the child could be buried in a decent ritual manner in a cemetery . according to your advice i shall submit a petition so that i can take my daughter away with me . � " since the patient had already been scheduled for the transport of 25 april 1941 , the director declined to return the patientl immediately to her mother . i put it at the discretion of the direction of the cure and care institution in niedernhart - linz , as transition institution , to possibly return the patient to the mother upon request . the mother threatened immediate suicide if she learned that her child , maria , was cremated " . " eglfing 23 april 1941 " . signed " direktion her heil- und pflegeanstalt des bezirksverbandes oberbayern eglfing - haar . " as a consequence of that intervention , maria mader was held back from the transport scheduled for 25 april 1941 ( appendix i , no.13 ) , but the intervention of her mother did not save her for long . her name was added in handwriting to the bottom of a list of victims sent to a killing center four days later , namely on 29 april 1941 ( appendix i , no.14 ) . it is likewise of interest to note that three other patients - 1 female , 2 males , were held back from the transport on 25 april 1941 , because these three patients had a brother or sister on the same transport ( appendix i , no.13 ) . brothers and sisters were not supposed to be taken together to a killing center on the same transport . i presume that the reason for this policy was that simultaneous receipt of the death notice of more than one child at once may have lent too much emphasis to the fact that they had been killed , rather than having died from disease or accident . most of the transports were initiated by a form letter from the state ministry of the interior , signed by dr. schultze , to the effect that the present situation necessitated transfer of about 140 patients , and that the patients would be called for by the transport company from berlin . the form letter goes on to say that all private property should be given to the patient , that all case histories and personal records have to be handed to the leader of the transport , and that the relatives responsible for payments should be notified that further payments should be suspended until the institution where the patient had been transferred would notify them . if , in the meantime , a relative should ask any questions , he should be told that the name of the institution where the patient had been transferred was not yet known and that the transfer was carried out on orders of the commissar for defence of the realm ( appendix i , no.15 ) . usually another notification directly from the gemeinn � tzige krankentransport g.m.b . h. concerning the exact time of arrival of the transports , most of which were carried out in the early hours of the morning , followed ( appendix i , nos . 16 , 17 and 18 ) . apparently special fees were charged for the killing as indicated by a letter from the gemeinn � tzige krankentransport g.m.b . h. to the cure and care institution in eglfing - haar , dated 25 february 1941 ( appendix i , no.19 ) , to the effect that the institutions should communicate to the transport company the names and addresses of the paying relatives of all those jewish patients who had been transferred to the general government area of poland ( presumably lublin ) , as well as the daily rates which those relatives had been paying , so that these relatives could be sent a bill according to those rates ._. _ _ the race relations ( amendment ) act 2000 places new duties on all public authorities to promote race equality . in response to this legislation the council is required to prepare and publish a race equality scheme that shows how we plan to do this , through setting out an action plan for improvement and change , together with identifying clear targets to measure progress . this document is manchester city council 's first race equality scheme , albeit in draft form , the scheme will be available for consultation on 31 may 2002 . the council has made arrangements with manchester council for community relations to carry out city wide consultation on the draft scheme . the consultation period will close in august and the council will issue a final scheme in october 2002 . the manchester education department will be publishing a more specific plan , this will be available from the education pages on the council 's web site . however , the arrangements within this scheme will also apply to the education department plan . the council is committed to mainstreaming racial equality and this scheme will be integrated within our performance , budget and service planning processes . the scheme builds on our positive record on promoting racial equality , which was recently recognised by the award of beacon council status_nn _ _ please send an e -

man , greedo , hammerhead , and the rare blue snaggletooth ) * rare * palitoy variations : the following were released by palitoy in the u.k and are slightly different to their u.s counterparts , and are alot more difficult to find too . land speeder - the engine hood can not be opened , unlike the u.s version . droid factory - the base of the playset was blue instead of the u.s versions yellow one . also the crane was not included in the palitoy version . deathstar space station - a very obvious difference to this one . the palitoy version was a smaller cardboard playset , while the u.s one was huge plastic playset , which featured alot of parts and accessories ( including the dianoga trash compactor monster that grabs luke skywalker in the film ) . land of the jawas - the base of the playset was very slightly different , and the pod that c-3po and r2-d2 used to escape the star destroyer in the film was not included . creature cantina - the base was ever so slightly different to the u.s version . large size figures : luke skywalker darth vader han solo princess leia organa chewbacca stormtrooper c-3po r2-d2 jawa ben ( obi - wan ) kenobi boba fett the empire strikes back

commander c-3po with removable limbs r2-d2 with sensorscope cloud car pilot zuckuss 4-lom * note- zuckuss and 4-lom , have had their names changed round , since the mid-90 's . this makes sense as 4-lom is more suited to a bounty hunter droid than an alien insectiod one . * creatures : hoth wampa tauntaun tauntaun ( with open belly rescue feature ) vehicles : ' battle damaged ' x - wing fighter twin pod cloud car at - at ( all terrain armored transport ) rebel armored snowspeeder slave 1 - boba fett spaceship rebel transport scout walker mini rigs & accessories : cap-2 ( captivator ) int-4 (

c-3po & r2-d2 were available on return of the jedi card backs . however some card backs can be found with han solo ( hoth outfit ) changed to the more cooler sounding han solo ( hoth battle gear ) , and yoda changed as yoda ( the jedi master ) . also some of the pictures on the card backs were changed , such as darth vader , ben kenobi , yoda and boba fett . action figures : admiral ackbar nien nunb luke skywalker ( jedi knight outfit ) * ( lightsabre in blue or green colour ) * princess leia organa ( boushh disguise ) emperor 's royal guard rebel commando biker scout chief chirpa logray (

picture on the box was set on tatooine , although i think the previous bespin scene was released on jedi boxes too ) * ' battle damaged ' x - wing fighter at - at ( all terrain armored transport ) * ( picture on the box can be found as the previous hoth scene , or the more difficult to find endor scene ) * rebel armored snow speeder * ( box differs slightly to the empire one , as the jedi box has a blue background , and some the figures are different too ) * slave 1 rebel transport scout walker * ( jedi boxes have the endor scene , while the empire boxes have the hoth scene ) * all mini rigs and accessories from the empire strikes back series excluding the pdt-8 ( apparently it did n't sell very well ) the darth vader tie fighter and patrol dewback were re - issued with the star wars logo during the return of the jedi series . the boxes had ' collectors series ' on the top right of the box . the vader tie also had the slots in the in the hatch , like the ' battle damaged ' tie and the tie interceptor , while the 1st star wars release did not . the power of the force series ( 1985 ) * rare * other figures available on power of the force cardbacks were darth vader , stormtrooper , ben kenobi , jawa , luke ( x - wing pilot),at - at driver , yoda , c-3po with removable limbs , gamorrean guard , luke ( jedi knight outfit ) , biker scout , nikto , wicket w. warrick , leia ( combat poncho ) , the emperor , b - wing pilot , at - st driver , han ( trench coat ) , teebo , lumat & paploo . this line of figures , is also known as the ' last 17 ' . although paploo and lumat were originally released during the second wave of return of the jedi figures , many collectors consider them to be part of the power of the force series . also this series was only released in the united states and canada . the european releases were on the tri - logo card backs . action figures : luke skywalker ( imperial stormtrooper outfit ) anakin skywalker imperial gunner romba warok lando calrissian ( general pilot ) han solo ( carbonite chamber ) amanaman barada ev-9d9 r2-d2 with pop - up lightsabre luke skywalker ( battle poncho ) imperial dignitary a - wing pilot yak face * ( not

catapult , wicket w. warrick , teebo & 2 stormtroopers ) endor chase ( included a speeder bike , 2 biker scouts , leia ( combat poncho ) , and wicket w. warrick ) tri - logo series ( 1985 ) the whole back catalogue of vintage figures , were released in europe on tri - logo card backs . the only ones ( to my knowledge anyway ) that did n't appear were the original c-3po and r2-d2 . the last 17 figures can be found with tri - logo card backs , and are alot easier to find than the power of the force ones . like the later return of the jedi releases , there were a few changes to the pictures on the card backs to look out for . the most notable of these are darth vader , luke skywalker , han solo , boba fett , chewbacca and ben ( obi - wan ) kenobi . some of the weapons had slight variations too . an example is the rifle that came with dengar and the hoth stormtrooper . droids series ( 1985 ) based on the spin off animated series . other figures available on droids card backs

variations to mention , but here is some of the more collectable ones to be on the look out for .... vinyl caped jawa - extremely rare , and often forged . beware of bootlegs . highly sought after by collectors . blue snaggletooth - not as rare as the vinyl caped jawa , but still one collectors go for . this was available as part of a sears exclusive playset in 1978 . telescoping lightsabres- the very early versions of darth vader , ben kenobi and luke skywalker had telescoping lightsabres . the sabres were almost double the size of the standard ones , and are highly sought after . like the vinyl caped jawa , they are often forged , due to them being rather rare and expensive . tri - logo boba fett- this figure was a lighter colour than the standard one , and had no paint work below the right knee . luke skywalker ( jedi knight outfit ) - there are loads of variations of this figure . one is the lightsabre , as kenner originally made a blue sabre ( possibly based on the revenge of the jedi teaser trailer ) , then quickly changed it to a green sabre , as seen in the film . the cloth cape , can be found either sewn collar , or snap button collar . also the figure can found in its packaging either with the cape on , or underneath the figure . mail aways : the following are figures or accessories , that kenner gave away free when you sent in proof of purchases . early bird mail away - as kenner did n't have any toys ready for christmas 1977 , they issued an early bird certificate , which you could send off , and receive 4 action figures when they were available . the figures were luke skywalker ( with telescopic lightsabre ) , princess leia organa , chewbacca and r2-d2 . display stand for the first 12 figures ( 1978 ) boba fett ( 1979 ) bossk ( 1980 ) empire strikes back

dianoga trash compactor monster - can be found with the u.s version of the deathstar playset . imperial probe droid - can be found with the turret & probot playset . carbonized han solo block - can be found with the slave 1 vehicle , and is opaque and slightly smaller than the one that came with the last 17 figure in 1985 . salacious crumb - can be found with jabba the hutt . i hope this has been some use for those just starting to build a up collection . i apologise if i 've missed something out , but there are alot of toys that were made between 1977 and 1985 , and i 'll keep adding to the list now and then , when i can . ebay is great for collecting these toys , and there are many reliable sellers to buy from . beware of bootlegs , and reproductions though . as these will not be worth anything , if you plan to make your collection an investment . please feel free to email me if you require a list of useful websites that are related to vintage star wars toys . happy collecting ! and

council beg leave to report to the university as follows : 1 . in may 1997 ( reporter , 1996 - 97 , p. 703 ) the council published a report proposing a development to accommodate the faculty of mathematics at clarkson road . the director of estate management was authorized to apply for planning consent for the development , and the council undertook to report again to the regent house when sufficient funds had been identified for the first phase of the project to proceed . the scheme proposed in the report comprised eight pavilions , linked to a central core , together with two free - standing buildings ; one of the latter , designated pavilions 9 and 10 , was to contain facilities similar to those in the other pavilions , while the other was to accommodate the proposed physical sciences and technology library . a planning application was lodged in july 1997 ; after detailed consultation with the planning authorities , who were concerned to ensure that the eastern part of the site should not be overdeveloped , it was agreed to omit pavilions 9 and 10 from the proposals . in order to produce a more balanced design for the site , the library was repositioned in the north - east corner , and a gatehouse was added in the location previously proposed for the library . the new arrangement is shown in the accompanying plan . the planning application was resubmitted in this revised form in november 1997 , and after further consultations planning consent has now been received . 2 . full planning permission will be subject to a number of conditions ; in addition , the university will be required to contribute funds for traffic calming , cycle route improvements , and a residents ' parking scheme . the total cost of these measures is � 140,000 ; this sum has been incorporated in the infrastructure costs of the development . 3 . in paragraph 4 of their 1997 report the council explained the terms on which the university would be able to acquire a long lease of the clarkson road site . the university has been granted an option to take a lease of the site from st john 's college for 175 years , with an option to renew this lease for a further period of 175 years , at a premium , representing the open market value , to be agreed . exercise of the first option is conditional on ( i ) the grant of detailed planning permission for the whole site , ( ii ) approval by the finance committee of the council of the terms of the planning permission , and ( iii ) a decision by the university to construct buildings on the site having a gross external area of not less than 2,500 square metres . the first two of these three conditions have now been satisfied . the third will be satisfied if the regent house approves the recommendations of the present report . the formal exercise of the option and agreement on the premium will therefore be possible when the regent house has agreed to take the development forward , though work can not commence until negotiations over the lease have been satisfactorily concluded . 4 . as explained in paragraph 7 of the 1997 report , construction will be phased in accordance with the availability of funds . for the present , detailed plans are being taken to tender stage for a first phase consisting of pavilions 1 , 2 , and 5 , together with the whole of the central core . provision can be made for pavilion 3 to be added to the contract should sufficient funds become available . the phasing of the plan in this way avoids incurring the abortive costs of piecemeal development while in no way committing the university to proceeding with the whole of the first phase if funds are not available . 5 . the total estimated cost of the development , still at prices current in the second quarter of 1996 , is � 39 m ( as against � 47.085 m previously reported ) ; this takes into account the omission of pavilions 9 and 10 and an expected saving of vat on the library . the revised cost of constructing pavilions 1 , 2 , and 5 and the whole central core is � 15.66 m , including fees , vat , and estimated inflation . the infrastructure costs are � 2.06 m in addition to that sum . the construction cost , at about � 1,300 a square metre , compares favourably with other university schemes in central cambridge and with ' prestige ' science park schemes . as explained in paragraph 9 of the 1997 report , the unattributable site infrastructure costs will be met from the chest . the sum of � 5 m has been earmarked in the land fund to meet the cost of acquiring the site and providing the infrastructure . 6 . the estimated running costs of the first phase are � 345,000 a year . the construction of the first phase will not release the whole of the premises currently occupied by mathematics at the old press site , and for that reason it is difficult to make comparisons on running costs . however , the running cost of the new building is expected to be � 48 per sq.m . a year , as against � 52 for the present premises . 7 . good progress has been made with fund raising for the project . donations received from outside the university amount to � 8.92 m , including exceptional gifts of � 2.5 m from dr and mrs hans rausing , � 2.5 m from mr nick corfield , � 2.5 m from the garfield weston foundation , and � 1 m from the wolfson foundation . colleges of the university have provided � 1.56 m , including a contribution of � 1.02 m from st john 's college and � 0.5 m from trinity college . as previously reported , a grant of � 3 m has been allocated by the council to the project from funds made available by the university press for purposes consonant with those of the press . together with interest which has accrued , a total of � 13.89 m has been raised . this leaves � 1.77 m still to be raised to meet the cost of the proposed first phase of the development , although this figure is reduced to � 1.25 m if future interest is taken into account . it is hoped that this gap will soon be bridged , and indeed the council believe that there is a good prospect of raising the further � 3.3 m needed for pavilion 3 . 8 . in order to avoid delaying the programme , it is proposed , subject to the successful conclusion of negotiations over the lease , that a contract should be let for enabling works , consisting of the bulk basement excavation , site hoarding , and certain infrastructure and landscaping works . subject to the approval of the recommendations of this report , work on the first phase will proceed thereafter according to the level of funds identified at the time . the

this worksheet looks at the effect of income tax changes on the level of aggregate supply , and considers the role of tax as a supply - side policy . the first step on calculating income tax is the same as worksheet 1 and can obviously be skipped if you have already done worksheet 1 . step 1 - how taxing is tax ? the first step to understanding the effect of income tax changes on demand is to see how income tax is calculated . income tax is charged at different rates for each level of income . for more details on this , you may want to look at the explanation of income tax . in the table below , we have worked out the tax bill of an unmarried individual earning � 40,000 a year . see if you can fill in the other columns for different levels of income . income level � 40,000 income level � 10,000 income level � 80,000 income level tax rate taxable income tax taxable income tax taxable income tax 0 - 4535 0 % 4535 0 0 0 0 0 4536 - 6415 10 % 1880 1880 * 10 % = � 188 6416 - 33935 22 % 27520 27520 * 22 % = � 6055 33935 + 40 % 6065 6065 * 40 % = � 2426 total income � 40,000 total tax bill � 8,669 * * the figures for � 40,000 income are worked out as follows : the first � 4,535 of income ( for an unmarried person ) is tax free - hence all the 0 figures in the first row . the next � 1,880 of taxable income ( i.e. the � 1,880 over and above the personal allowance ) is taxed at the lower rate of 10 % . the next � 27,520 of taxable income is then taxed at 22 % . in the case of the person earning � 10,000 this will clearly only be a small amount of their income . anything over and above this is then taxed at 40 % , though many people 's earnings will obviously never make it into this band . in the case above , the rest of the � 40,000 left over and above � 33,935 is what is taxed at 40 % . step 2 - taxing at the margin use either the explanation of income tax or the glossary to find out the definition of the ' marginal rate of tax ' and the ' average rate of tax ' . marginal rate of tax | | | | average rate of tax | | | | use the examples in step 1 to work out the marginal rate of tax ( on the next pound earned ) , and the average rate of tax for each income level . marginal tax rate average tax rate income level : � 10,000 � 40,000 � 80,000 at which of these income levels does a person have the most incentive to earn more money ? | why ? | | | if the government therefore want to create an incentive to work harder what should they do with the level of taxation ? | | cutting top rates of taxation has also been suggested as an appropriate policy . why should this help the economy ? | | | | step 3 - supplying tax or taxing the supply ? use the glossary or your own references to find a definition of supply - side policies and write it below : supply - side policies | | | | why is cutting taxation a supply - side policy ? ( n.b. think back to what we established in step 2 . ) | | | | use the library section of the virtual economy or the glossary to find out the answers to the following questions : what is ' say 's law ' ? | | | why is say 's law important ? | | | | | draw a diagram to show the impact that classical economists argue supply - side policies will have on the economy in the long - run . step 4 - a testing theory we now want to test the impact of supply - side policies on the economy . however , this is difficult . if we simply cut tax there will also be effects on aggregate demand . draw on the diagram below , the effects on aggregate demand and aggregate supply from a tax cut . so to try to isolate just the supply - side effects of a tax cut we will need to make sure that we remove an equivalent amount of demand to the amount the tax cut increases it . we will do this by trying to ensure that the effect on the psncr from our tax cuts is zero . this is called a ' revenue neutral ' policy . try the following on the model : cut the top rate of tax by a small amount and reduce government expenditure by an equivalent amount cut the top rate of tax by a larger amount and reduce government expenditure by an equivalent amount cut the basic rate of tax in the same way - by a small and larger amount n.b. you may have to experiment to achieve this . try to keep the value of the psncr as close as possible to its pre - reform level . alternatively do the tax cut first and see how much tax revenue is affected . then go back to the model and reduce government expenditure by the same amount . what effects has this had on the level of growth and unemployment ? tax change effect on : small top rate tax cut large top rate tax cut small basic rate tax cut large basic rate tax cut 2001 economic growth unemployment 2002 economic growth unemployment 2003 economic growth unemployment 2004 economic growth unemployment 2005 economic growth unemployment how successful have these policies been as supply - side policies ? | | | | | | | step 5 - supplying the demand or demanding the supply ? use the economic theory section of the virtual economy to write an analysis of the views of keynesian and classical economists about the relative virtues of demand - side and supply - side policies . which group advocates the use of which policies and why ? | | | | | | | | | | | | step 6 - supplying policies to the economy ? now try using the model to test out some supply - side tax policies . the overall idea should be to aim to improve incentives to work and to reward enterprise . why not try : cutting marginal tax rates cutting average tax rates cutting average and marginal tax rates try to do all these in a revenue - neutral way . that is try to avoid any increases in the psncr as a result of your policies . this will generally mean cutting government expenditure by an equivalent amount to your tax cuts . make sure also that inflation stays below 2.5 % . which policies were the most successful at creating a higher level of growth ( without inflation ) ? | | | | what problems are you likely to face in using supply - side policy as the main tool of economic management

_ _ training on evaluation methods this area provides information about training on evaluation methods and provides access to training resources . it divides into four sections . introduction training in policy evaluation and analysis teaching and learning methods evaluation seminars national school of government courses back to evaluating policy introduction a range of types of evidence and evaluation are used in evidence - based policy making , drawing upon a number of research methods and research designs ( see research and evaluation ) . the area of policy evaluation and analysis is well established and constantly developing in terms of the application of various social scientific techniques to different types of policy intervention . this presents a challenge to both the customers / users of policy evaluation , and the researchers and analysts who undertake policy evaluation and analysis , to keep abreast of developments in the field . training in policy evaluation and analysis the government social research unit has developed a range of training and professional development opportunities for the ' intelligent ' customer and the ' intelligent provider ' of policy evaluation and analysis . these modules can be taken as stand alone professional development opportunities , or in combination , to meet the learning needs of students . for those students who wish to gain academic credit for this training and professional development , each module will carry cat accreditation . this will make it possible for those students who wish to do so to work towards a master 's level degree in policy analysis and evaluation . teaching and learning methods a central feature of the proposed modules , and of the msc in policy analysis and evaluation for those who would like to pursue this goal , is the principle of teaching and learning by problem based learning . this builds the teaching and learning around students ' needs and work - based problems for which they require solutions . assessment of students ' competence will be by project based work such as research dossiers , extended essays , problem - solving exercises , literature searches and critical appraisal exercises , and worked exercises . for further details about this training and professional development programme , please contact ricky taylor . evaluation seminars government social research unit runs policy evaluation and technical methods seminars for government analysts and policy makers . the evaluation seminar series invites government and academic researchers to speak about methodology and practice . the technical methods seminars cover in more depth specific methodologies such as propensity score matching and theory based evaluation . national school of government courses on policy evaluation and analysis regular courses are run in sunningdale and london on analytical skills and evaluation methods including:- evaluation of public programmes and policies - designed to give participants a thorough understanding of the methodologies available for the evaluation of government programmes and policies . economics for policy making - designed for non - economists who contribute to analysis of , and who need a context and rationale for , policy decisions . improved specialist contribution to policy - designed for specialists who contribute analysis to aid policy formation , or who manage or are managed by generalist administrators . introduction to evidence based policy making - designed to provide an understanding of the need to use evidence at all stages of the policy process . overview of evidence based policy making - provides an overview of the purposes and practicalities of basing policy on evidence ) practical statistical skills - provides a basic introduction to statistical techniques most commonly used to convert raw numerical data into understandable facts . presenting data and analysing statistics - designed for staff with some numeracy and spreadsheet experience who wish to gain skills in this area because of their work responsibilities . quantitative methods for policy management - designed for people on the fast stream and other development programmes the course is intended to provide an understanding of some essential statistical concepts , and an appreciation of the use of other quantitative methods in both management and policy work . visit the national school of government portfolio for further details policy hub , hm treasury , g.38 , 1 horse guards road , london sw1a 2hq [ crown copyright ] [ privacy

international conference , to be held at bretton hall campus , west yorkshire . the conference is structured around four strands : international panel sessions that are curating , presenting and discussing practice as research in the context of local systems and infrastructures . uk - based practitioner - researchers presenting performances / screenings for plenary peer review . uk - based practitioner - researchers offering presentations for peer review / discussion , in combinations of performances / screenings ; performances / screenings with associated documentation ; and expository writing - based conference papers . uk and international practitioner - researchers designing and running three - hour workshops . conference fee including full registration , standard ( not en suite ) university accommodation ( 4 nights ) and meals : � 190.00 unwaged | student � 270.00 institutionally waged it is expected that registration will be available from late march 2005 , parip 2005 is a not - for - profit conference . we request that participants seek financial support for fees , travel and subsistence from their institutions . for participants without institutional affiliation parip will support applications to funding councils and foundations . to keep costs down as much as possible all delegates and presenters are required to pay the conference fee . bretton hall campus is well served by air ( leeds - bradford international ) , rail ( to wakefield westgate ) , road ( approx 2 km from m1 ) and bus ( from wakefield ) ._. _ _ students must be at least 17 years and 6 months on the day that the course starts . this is not negotiable . the upper age limit is 50 years . 2 teaching staff the staff of the two university schools who teach on the course are highly qualified . the vast majority are qualified practicing nurses and hold degrees at first or masters level . many have or are pursuing the award of a ph.d. some staff are not nurses but hold higher degrees or doctorates in allied subjects such as physiology or psychology . 3 course assessment because courses at apu are based on an inquiry based learning model , the types of assessment encountered are varied . there will be some essays to write and even an exam , although there is no ' final examination ' . assessment could involve the presentation of your learning to be trained nurse responsible in the practice area . you may produce a video that shows your learning or you could participate in a group feedback session where your progress is assessed . 4 accommodation this arranged through the accommodation office of the university . university accommodation is at rivermead , ( very modern , en suite , with telephones in rooms . mildmay hall is less modern , not en suite but comfortable . we also use a lot of private flats , bed - sits and lodgings ) . students will usually be expected to move to hospital based accommodation for the branch programme . cost : rivermead is � 210 per month . a deposit of � 150 is also needed . accommodation is allocated on a first come first serve basis and is not guaranteed . all accommodation is single only . no married accommodation is available . the structure of the course ensures that students experience actual nursing / midwifery practice from the outset with the theory and practice being linked . before the course commences you will be allocated a placement base . you may wish to seek accommodation at that base rather than travel from the apu campus . not all hospital sites have accommodation available in which case some students seek private accommodation . 5 bursaries available uk nationals undertaking the diploma of higher education : registered nurse course are eligible to receive a non - means tested bursary and are not required to pay fees . uk nationals undertaking the degree course are eligible to receive a means tested bursary and are not required to pay fees . both bursaries have some allowance for dependency payments but these are means tested in both cases . nationals of the eea are usually not eligible to receive either bursary but do not have to pay course fees . international students are not eligible to receive either bursary and will be required to pay course fees of approximately � 10,750 each year for the three years of the course . those applicants who can demonstrate settled status in the uk for 3 years for purposes other than education may however be eligible to receive a bursary and will not be required to pay fees . further information is available from the admissions office or at interview . 6 . working whilst studying the university does not encourage students on this course undertaking employment outside the course . candidates should realise that this is a course of study that has a 45 week year and leaves little room for income generation . 7 . timetabling arrangements timetables are published approximately 4 weeks before each semester or study period . your first timetable will be given when you start the course . timetables will give details of classes and lectures that must be attended . all timetables are subject to change but the university tries to give as much notice as possible . the teaching day begins at 9.00a.m . and ends at 5.00 p.m. 8 . sickness and absence although we realise that everyone is unable to attend class on occasion ; for student nurses and midwives there is a need to achieve the required hours in order to gain registered nurse or registered midwife status . repeated and excessive absence is unacceptable and can result in the student 's course being discontinued . there is no provision for consideration to be made for any one individual 's child care needs and candidates should ensure they are able to undertake a full time course of study of three years duration . if you wish to discuss your decision regarding undertaking a nursing or midwifery course with us , please contact jan hancock in the recruitment office , who will be pleased to talk with you . 9 . holidays all leave dates are determined by the academic timetable and are only variable in very exceptional circumstances and by negotiation with the course management team . holidays are usually three weeks in the summer period between june and september . at least a week is given at christmas and some time at easter . these periods do not align with school holidays and candidates must ready to undertake this commitment . students who miss class or practice time prior to holidays due to flight times or other travel arrangements could face disciplinary action if the course team does not agree this in advance . 10 . modern and well equipped library the library is at the rivermead campus in chelmsford and is very modern and extremely well equipped . internet access and email is free to students . word processing facilities are also available . the library staff are friendly and helpful . 11 . university childcare the university does offer creche facilities but places are limited . it is based at rivermead campus and the charges are available on request . if you do have a place for your child at the nursery , and you do not wish to use it during practice placement periods , a charge of � 1 a session ( am or pm ) is made to hold that place open for when you are back at the chelmsford campus . 12 . travel during placements students are expected to travel to placements as required by their course of studies . some sites are accessible by train and others can be reached by bus . in order to reach your placement site in time for your duty , it may mean that some days being very early ! this is why some students choose to seek residency at their hospital site rather than on the apu campus . there is extra funding for travel . acceptance of an offer at apu means you could be placed at any of our nhs sites . although we endeavour to note requests for a specific site , no guarantee is given . 13 police checks nurses and midwives are in a special position of trust and therefore the public needs to feel confident in us . all nursing and midwifery students must agree to undergo a police check and must declare any criminal record at the time of interview . those applicants who declare a criminal record are invited to a second confidential meeting with two senior academics to discuss the issue . having a criminal record may not be a bar to nurse or midwifery training . should you fail to declare any record at the time of interview and it subsequently comes to light , your offer of a place may be withdrawn . 14 occupational health all students must undergo an occupational health clearance and all offers are subject to this being satisfactory . failure to disclose a relevant health issue at the time of screening could result in the student 's course being discontinued . students must have a full immunisation portfolio , including proof of immunity to hepatitis b , before they commence the course . you should note that if you fail to attend an arranged appointment with the occupational health nurse or doctor , you would be charged a cancellation fee of � 15 . 15 open days those students who are offered a place are invited to a pre - course open day or a university open day prior to course commencement . at these events you have the chance to visit the campuses , meet some of the staff and chat to current students . 16 students from eea countries these students do not require a visa . the international department will provide travel details and general advice before the course starts . the admissions requirement for these courses includes competence in english , and therefore applicants from countries where english is not the main language , are required to provide evidence of competence in the form of an ielts ( international english language testing system ) certificate at 6.5 with a minimum of 6 in any component . applications will not be processed until proof of a successful ielts test is received . 17 students from non eea countries students from non - eea countries are advised to contact the international office ext . 3061 . the admissions requirement for these courses includes competence in english , and there applicants from countries where english is not the main language , are required to provide evidence of competence in the form of ielts certificate at 6.5 with a minimum of 6 in any component . applications will not be processed until proof of a successful ielts test is received . 18 ielts details of the ielts test can be obtained from the british council in your own country or from the apu international office . 19 careers in nursing and midwifery nursing and midwifery offer a range of career opportunities and the following diagram shows some of these . look at it carefully as choices you make at this stage can affect your later career . for example , nurses qualified in child nursing can not go on to study midwifery at a later date , but they can become health visitors . if you are unsure as to whether your course choice will help you achieve your career goals , then contact us now and discuss the issues . it can be very difficult to change direction once you are on a course . 20 applying for a place on a nursing or midwifery course the process of applying for any course begins with checking that you have the entry requirements . the entry standard for the diploma level course is : 5 gcse passes at grade c or above ( including english ) or nvq level 3 gnvq advanced or a combination of qualifications . the entry standard for the degree courses ( both nursing and midwifery ) is : 5 gcse passes at grade c or above ( including english and maths or science ) plus 2 a levels at grade c or above or equivalent . if you do not have the correct , or enough , qualifications , speak to a careers advisor at your college or school , or your local careers centre or alternatively an admissions tutor at the university for advice on the options available to you . if you are sure that you have the correct entry requirements then an application form can be obtained from for diploma courses : nmas rosehill new barn lane cheltenham glos . gl52 3la 01242 544949 for degree courses : ucas rosehill new barn lane cheltenham glos . gl52 3la 01242 227788 carefully fill in the application form addressing all parts of the document and use the personal statement as an opportunity to " sell yourself " to the university . if your application form is incomplete untidy , and unreadable or has insufficient information it is possible tha tyou may not be short - listed for interview . the selection process for interview involves careful consideration of the application form together with references . if we do short list you for interview , good preparation will alleviate some of your anxiety . the following ideas may help . carefully read the letter inviting you for interview noting the time , date and venue . make sure you know where you are going and allow time for travelling . you can not park in the university , but if you park in one of the two car parks and make your way to the central campus opposite the br station , and produce your ' invitation to interview ' letter , you can use the university transport to ashby house where the interview suite is located . also note the documentation you are required to bring . you will normally be asked to show us the original , and provide a photocopy of a ) your birth certificate b ) your marriage certificate ( if appropriate ) and c ) relevant education certificates d ) completed oh form e ) completed police check k form . if any of the above documents are not available the interview will not proceed . think about the questions you are likely to be asked and consider your answers . ( you will certainly be asked a question that involves explaining what nursing or midwifery entails , the qualities you would expect to find in a good nurse or midwife , and whether you think you possess these qualities ) . be prepared to demonstrate at interview relevant work experience , either paid or in the voluntary sector . if you feel you have not had previous experience in a health care setting think about transferable skills . you may have helped in a play group or youth club , or you may have considerable experience as a baby sitter ! we value life experience . consider what it will be like to be a student at the university . brush up on your study skills if you have not been a student for a while and be prepared to tell us how you are going to organise your work . a knowledge of computer skills will be valuable in your studies and in your future work as a nurse or midwife . finally , show an interest in the subject , read a nursing or midwifery journal ( e.g. nursing times or british journal of midwifery ) regularly for a few weeks before coming for interview , so that you know something about current issues . read a broad sheet newspaper so that you know what the political issues are in the national health service . watch relevant documentary programmes on the television , but do not prepare by just watching the latest hospital soap ! if you are recommended for a place on the course we will make a conditional offer by letter as soon as possible after the interview . the conditions attached may be in respect of a police check , an occupational health check or the receipt of a further satisfactory reference and in some cases , the achievement of the required examination results . applicants who are unsuccessful at any stage during this process are welcome to seek advice as to how to develop their potential if they wish to reapply at a later date . 21 . the interview the interview takes place in the interview suite . there will be two interviewers , one university lecturer , and a colleague from one of the nhs trusts with whom we collaborate . 22 the interview format is as follows : you hand in your documents and the copies and these will be checked against your application . the originals will be returned in your records . you must also hand in your completed check forms . you will have the opportunity to discuss the course with the lecturer and ask any questions . you will be interviewed by a panel of two . you will be asked questions designed to give a picture of you and evaluate your motivation to become a nurse or midwife . these will be the opportunity for you to ask any other questions that you may have . at the end of the interview you will be asked to attend for occupational health screening and will be directed to where this will take place . you must hand in your completed occupational health check form to the nurse . you will be informed of the outcome of your interview as soon as possible usually within a week ._. _ _ for many users windows 2000 will meet all their requirements for an operating system , however there may be many reasons why a user would choose to install a second operating system alongside it : extra gaming performance , application compatibility , use of dos/16 bit based programmes , or just a desire to have a change now and then ! dual booting means the simultaneous installation of a second operating system : the selection of which system you wish to use is made during the boot process from a boot loader menu . initially this section will deal with the most common dual boot configuration : windows 2000 and win 95/98/me ( win9x ) . it is recommended that you install windows 9x first in a dual boot configuration . there are good reasons for this : firstly , by not installing 2000 first it ensures that you do not format the boot partition as ntfs , which would prevent the installation of windows 9x ; secondly the windows 9x installation routine will of overwrite the windows 2000 boot sector with its own , rendering the 2000 installation unbootable . if you need to install windows 9x alongside an existing windows 2000 installation i would strongly recommend the use of third party boot manager software such as the excellent system commander 2000 . install this programme after you have completed your windows 9x installation ( it can not currently be installed under windows 2000 ) , and it will automatically detect both installations and create the appropriate boot menu . alternative boot manager programmes are bootmanager 2000 , xosl , and bootstar . dual boot tools is another set of utilities that will allow you to access ntfs from fat partitions , and to access dos in ntfs . alternatively , you can run windows 2000 set - up again , and select repair installation : this will restore the windows 2000 boot loader and allow you to access both operating sytems . third party boot managers can cause problems when trying to repair installations of windows 2000 . ensure that you have a separate partition available for your windows 2000 installation , then run the windows 2000 setup from within windows 9x. ( note that if you are trying to install windows 9x alongside an existing windows 2000 installation , you will have to use a boot disk to access dos , and run the setup from a dos prompt ) the setup process will run and install the boot loader automatically : you will be presented with a choice of available operating systems at boot up . note that the boot files for both operating systems are placed on the same partition , even though the operating systems themselves are on different partitions . once your windows 2000 installation is complete you can configure the options for the boot loader screen in control panel / system / advanced / startup & recovery : here you can select the default operating system , and the time the menu will display before the default is selected ( if you select 0 here , you will not see the menu displayed ) . for information on files which can be shared on a dual boot system , see here . the boot.ini file the boot loader information can also be accessed via a system file called boot.ini which is in the root of the boot partition , c : is normally the boot partition . to access this file you must uncheck tools / folder options / view / hide protected operating system files . to access the boot.ini file on a ntfs partition from dos you can use the ntfs.ini programme from powerquest ; if it is on a fat partition you can access it from dos using the edit function , but you may have to set the attributes to make it visible e.g. " attrib -r -h -s c:\boot.ini " . the contents of the file will look something like this : [ boot loader ] timeout=3 default = multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\winnt [ operating systems ] multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\winnt= " microsoft windows 2000 professional " /fastdetect /nodebug c:\= " microsoft windows millennium edition " this is a dual boot configuration with windows 2000 and millennium , with a three second menu display , using windows 2000 as the default operating system . here you can alter the timeout figure , and by altering the descriptions in blue , you can change the information that is presented in the boot menu . in this sytem millennium is actually installed on the d : drive , but it shows as c : because that is where the boot files are for the system . setting timeout=0 would mean the system would boot into windows 2000 automatically , with no menu displayed . the multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1 ) section is importan t because it gives the path to the windows 2000 installation folder . the multi(0 ) means the first ide or scsi disk controller , normally a system will have only one ( this will show as scsi(0 ) for a scsi controller without the bios enabled ) ; the disk(0 ) refers to the first physical disk on the system , and the partition(1 ) refers to the first partition on that disk . boot.ini switches note the addition of the /nodebug switch , this specifies that no monitoring of debugging information takes place , which can speed up the system . the /fastdetect switch , which is usually set by default , disables serial mouse detection during rebooting . one switch worth remembering if you are having driver problems whilst booting is /sos , which displays the device driver names as they are being loaded , and can help you determine which driver is causing the problem . finally , adding the switch /bootlog creates a log file of the boot up process called ntbtlog.txt . creating a windows 2000 boot disk to create a set of setup boot disks , run makeboot.exe from the bootdisk folder on the windows 2000 cd - rom : insert the windows 2000 cd - rom in the cd - rom drive . click start , and then click run . in the open box type drive:\bootdisk\makeboot a : , and then press enter , where drive is the letter of your cd - rom drive . note : you do not have to be running windows to create the setup boot disks . for example , you can start your computer with a windows 98 startup disk , and then run the makeboot.exe file from the windows 2000 cd - rom . to make a simple boot disk that will allow you to boot into windows 2000 in the event that your one or more of your boot files is corrupted , e.g. boot.ini or ntldr , you can make a single boot disk by formatting a floppy disk in windows 2000 , and then copying the following files from your active partition e.g. c:\ to your newly formatted floppy : boot.ini , ntldr , bootsect.dos , ntbootdd.sys ( you will only need this file if you are using scsi(x ) in the boot.ini file , see above ) and ntdetect.com . then if you are unable to boot into windows 2000 for any reason simply insert the boot disk , and the loader menu will appear , and you can boot as normal ._. _ _ before you go home , you will need a follow -

and save money ! the wasteful use of energy , especially when it has come from burning fossil fuels , is causing serious damage to the global environment . this website is designed to offer you some basic energy advice , on ways in which you can reduce your impact on the environment - and save some money at the same time ! before we start , it is helpful to consider the right order to do things . so it is best to try and save energy by : avoiding wasting energy , then using energy more efficiently , then using energy from clean renewable sources . the first steps - avoiding waste - cost nothing , and immediately start saving you money . some of them may involve some changes to your lifestyle , such as walking or taking the bus rather than driving off in your car . others are simple matters of habit - like switching off lights when they are not in use , and checking that the room thermostat on your heating system is set correctly . this is sometimes known simply as energy conservation . conservation does not mean having to go without , even if some people do think it is characterised by the world war ii poster shown here . most of the next steps in the stage , using energy efficiently , involve a modest outlay . some of the suggestions cost just a few pounds , and will pay for themselves within a year . others require quite significant investment , or may involve professional installation . however almost all energy efficiency measures will eventually pay for themselves in lower fuel bills . once you are using energy efficiently without waste , you can really start to think about where that energy is coming from . clean , renewable energy sources - often with the sun as the ultimate source of the energy - are all around us . sometimes they are a little difficult to capture , or more expensive than digging polluting fossil fuels out of the ground . but there are a surprising number of small - scale renewable energy sources that wo n't cost the earth , and can be installed at an average uk home or business . and for the energy that you are not producing yourself , you can look at buying certified green electricity . some people want to rush in and use renewable energy from the very start . this is fine , but is likely to cost you more than by first looking carefully at how you are using energy . as most countries do n't yet have enough renewables developed to meet demand , it is best to use this type of energy as efficiently and wisely as possible . energy advice from the national energy foundation in summary , this site can offer advice on : energy conservation - avoiding the waste of energy energy efficiency - saving energy by getting the most benefit for each unit consumed renewable energy - only using energy that has come from clean sources that do not reduce the ability of future generations to use energy from the same source a website can only offer information and broad guidance about energy and can not be a substitute for detailed advice . if you want to know more about ways of saving energy you could contact your local energy efficiency advice centre by ringing them on 0800 - 512012 or complete one of our recommended online home energy surveys . alternatively , if you wish to have an expert carry out a detailed energy audit of your home , you could contact the national home energy rating scheme on 01908 - 672787 and ask them about nher site assessors who may be able to carry out such audits in your area . alternatively , if you are considering a larger project , especially in the areas of community - scale or building - integrated renewables , we offer consultancy services . we are also able to help you understand more about why we need to save energy , and to calculate your own carbon dioxide emissions . finally , we should tell you why we are offering you this free advice . the national energy foundation is an educational charity registered in england that has been helping uk citizens learn more about safe and efficient use of energy for over 15 years . we also have over 10 years ' practical experience in advising people about how to install effective renewable energy systems at the domestic and community level . we receive no core funding , and are controlled by an independent board of trustees , whose only concern is to protect the environment by avoiding the waste of energy . more info for more information on saving energy : contact your local energy efficiency advice centre on 0800 512012 or complete one of our recommended online home energy surveys . for detailed energy audit of your home , contact the national home energy rating scheme ( nher ) on 01908 672787 . events nef is sponsoring the following events : sustainable energy for homeowners 15 july 2006 milton keynes energy 2006 7 -

earth system . the two satellites will trace the flow of energy from the sun to the earth and provide the first 3d stereographic images to study the nature of coronal mass ejections . the two sun - pointed observatories will have identical instrument complements . each will be in a heliocentric orbit drifting away from the earth , one leading and one lagging . scientific impact the scientific objectives of the stereo mission are to understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejection ( cme ) initiation ; characterise the propagation of cmes through the heliosphere ; improve the determination of the structure of the ambient solar wind and to discover the mechanisms and sites of energetic particle acceleration in the low corona and the interplanetary medium . strategic priority stereo will address how the sun effects the earth and energy flow in the solar system . the mission will lead to the esa solar orbiter mission . timeliness stereo is the third mission in nasa 's solar terrestrial probes program and follows soho and the esa cluster mission . track record the uk has unique hardware capabilities , which has been demonstrated by pi participation on all major solar missions such as soho , and recieves requests from us teams for uk collaborators . momentum the stereo mission is due for launch in july / august 2006 . the most efficient method to place the twin observatories into their respective orbits , while still launching on one rocket will be to use the technique known as lunar swingbys . the stereo launch will be the first time this technique has been used to manipulate the orbits of more than one space craft at a time . uk involvement the uk has ral as the pi on the heliospheric imager ( hi ) on each space craft , which is part of the sun earth connection and heliospheric investigation ( secchi ) suite of instruments . the hi instruments , with their unique field of view , will provide the first direct imaging observations of cmes in the inner heliosphere risk there is a possibility of a launch delay for stereo . cost the cost of uk involvement of stereo to date is � 1.8 m other factors there will be future possibilities of joint operations between soho , stereo and solar - b space missions ._. _ _ encounters with animals can cause problems for the traveller and any unnecessary contact with them should be avoided . many large mammals are easily capable of killing humans . few animals will pick a fight with humans but most will defend themselves if cornered or surprised and females will defend their young aggressively . when venturing into wildlife country on foot be sure to take a guide who understands the local animals . take great care when walking through long grass or dense scrub which could conceal a potentially dangerous animal . large carnivores can not be outrun so are better faced . try shouting , throwing rocks or waving sticks which may confuse the animal and make it back away . running away is just what the prey would do and could precipitate an attack . be very careful when camping in big cat country . do n't sleep in a tent with anything that may attract a large creature , bears will rip open tents to get at the contents . there are many dangerous animals to be found roaming freely in parts of africa and asia . as well as the big cats , these include include rhinos , hippos , elephants and ( african ) buffaloes which can be particularly aggressive . large primates like baboons and chimpanzees can be particularly dangerous . it pays to be well informed when travelling into areas where these animals are found . if you are going on a safari to a game reserve , stay inside your vehicle when appropriate and always follow the advice of your guide . when travelling close to rivers in africa , south america and parts of australia beware of crocodiles which can be lurking in shallow water near to the river bank . because we have so much contact with domestic animals , we are much more likely to be injured by them than by wild animals . travellers have been injured by cats , dogs , cattle , pigs , camels , water buffalo , elephants , etc . be wary of any domestic animals you do not know . by far the most common domestic animal responsible for attacks on humans are dogs . worldwide they are responsible for hundreds of deaths annually . i n many countries they often run wild and may respond aggressively when approached . if you are threatened by a dog pick up a stick and wave it or some stones to throw at it or even pretend to if none are around . most dogs will retreat if they think you are armed . dog bites not only inflict severe injury but can also spread dangerous infections like tetanus or even rabies . rabies is present worldwide - except in the united kingdom , parts of scandinavia , japan , oceania , antarctica , australia , new zealand , malta and some of the caribbean islands . it can be transmitted to humans in several ways , but most commonly via the bite of an infected domestic dog . rabies , if left untreated , will always cause death ! precautions do not stroke dogs and cats and avoid contact with bats , jackals , foxes and other wild animals . animals that appear unusually tame may be dying of rabies . in an area endemic for rabies all unprovoked bites or licks should be considered a possible exposure . in the event of possible exposure to rabies immediate treatment should be instigated:- thorough cleansing of the wound should be undertaken with soap or detergent and running water for 5 minutes . apply an antiseptic such as iodine , chlorhexidine or alcohol . seek medical assistance as soon as possible . it may be necessary to commence rabies vaccination and anti - tetanus measures . if you have been immunised against rabies prior to being bitten you may still require further doses of vaccine . travellers who have never been immunised against rabies and then receive a suspect bite , should be vaccinated within 24 - 48 hours . snakes most species of snakes are harmless and over half of the venomous species do not have the capability or temperament to be harmful . even aggressive and venomous species will very often inflict a " dry bite " which is venom free . snakes do not like to waste their venom on anything other than prey species . remember , only one in a thousand people bitten by a snake actually dies as a result . most deaths from snake bites occur on the indian subcontinent where they are often forced into contact with humans . however , if you are bitten by a snake you should always be assessed by an expert as it is often quite difficult for ordinary travellers to distinguish between dangerous and harmless species . dangerous species of snakes are found in many tropical and desert regions and local inhabitants are occasionally bitten and sometimes killed by them . foreign travellers are rarely bitten . although snakes are found worldwide , the counties of the world where travellers are most likely to encounter venomous snakes are include ; australia , north , south and central america , africa , the indian subcontinent and south east asia . if you are bitten by a snake stay calm and get help immobilise the bitten limb avoid tampering with the wound remove any rings or jewellery from the bitten limb keep the bite at or below the level of the heart . apply a pressure bandage firmly to the bite site and cover as much of the bitten limb as possible get the victim to a hospital or clinic for prompt treatment don't panic ! snakes never attack without provocation , they are generally shy and where possible , shun human contact . avoid disturbing , cornering or handling them . walking barefoot in vegetation , swimming in murky water and climbing rocks and trees covered with foliage are all risky . at night use a torch . never tease a snake as teasing could cause the snake to increase the dose of venom . if you are bitten , move away from the snake to prevent additional bites . first aid for snakebite is controversial . the only universally approved first aid applicable globally , is immobilisation of the bitten area / limb and keeping the victim still . the victim should then be transferred to a hospital or clinic for medical treatment if available . this should involve the minimum of exertion by the victim as possible . snake venom travels primarily via the lymphatic system . therefore , to prevent the spread of venom the movement of lymph needs to be restricted . this is achieved by immobilising the bitten area ( usually a limb ) , keeping it level with or just below the heart and by the application of a pressure bandage . you should never apply a tourniquet to a snake bite . a tourniquet is a tight band placed around a limb designed to restrict the blood flow to and from the limb . inappropriate use of tourniquets can lead to unnecessary loss of the limb . a splinted bandage to immobilise the limb can often be of more use . a suction device may be used to help draw the venom out of the wound without making cuts . whilst moving the victim to get medical help , monitor their vital signs i.e. pulse and rate of breathing . if there are signs of shock , lay them flat , raise their feet and try to keep them warm . reassure them that bites can be effectively treated by trained medical staff . in some areas where venomous snakes are endemic ( such as australia ) , venom detection kits are often used by medical personnel . these allow the site to be swabbed and a sample of venom collected which is used to accurately identify the snake or group of snakes to which the biter belongs to . this enables the use of more specific and more effective antivenom . washing the bite may remove traces of venom that otherwise could be detected by the kit . however , these kits are not always available to medical staff in poorer developing countries so in this instance cleaning the wound thoroughly with an antiseptic soap or solution would a good idea . medical treatment will be greatly assisted if the snake can be accurately identified . if the snake can be captured and/or killed without risk of anyone else being bitten , take it to show the doctor at the treatment clinic . anti - venom when available should only be administered by those experienced in its use . avoiding snakes when you are travelling through areas where venomous snakes are endemic and/or problems with them have been previously reported:- when walking around , make plenty of noise , wear boots or strong shoes and long trousers , and watch where you step or place your hands . sleep under a mosquito net that is well tucked in . never sleep on the ground unless you are in a tent with a sewn in groundsheet . avoid areas where snakes may be hiding -- under rocks , logs , etc . tap ahead of you with a walking stick before entering an area with an obscured view of your feet . snakes will attempt to avoid you if given adequate warning . after dark , always carry a torch . if you see a snake , keep your distance . use your common sense . further information : university of adelaide -

fatal but some can be very painful . try to immobilise the affected limb and seek medical assistance . ice can be applied to the bite site and antihistamines and pain killers may also be used to treat any symptoms . bites from the truly poisonous spiders such as funnel webs ( left ) should be treated like snake bites and medical assistance should be sought as soon as possible . the spider should be killed and taken along to the doctor for identification . the spider bite victim should be transported as quickly and as passively as possible to the nearest place where they can be seen by a medically - trained person . scorpions are usually found in arid regions . they like to hide in dark shady places and sometimes they will hide inside your boots . therefore , you should always check your footwear before putting them on in areas where scorpions are found . they sting in self defense using their tail sting which in most cases is very painful rather than life threatening . however , potentially lethal scorpions do exist in mexico , south america , the caribbean , north africa , the middle east and the indian subcontinent which can cause neurotoxicity with blurred vision and breathing difficulty , myocardial damage and pancreatitis . immediate medical help should always be sought if bitten . first aid for scorpion bites is similar to that of spider bites . wash the sting area and apply a cold compress . immobilise the the victim and seek rapid medical help . antihistamines and painkillers may be used to treat the pain and swelling . there are antivenins available for the more dangerous species but these must be given quickly ._. _ _ by penny tompkins and james lawley do you make ' mountains out of molehills ' , or are problems just ' a drop in the ocean ' ? how you proportion your perceptions is fundamental to the structure of your subjective experience . your map may not be the territory , but if it 's to be of much use you 'd better know its scale . this article is about the nature of scale , how to begin modeling it , and what happens when you change the scale of things to come . " how big is it ? how long does it last ? these are the most basic questions a scientist can ask about a thing . they are so basic to the way people conceptualize the world that it is not easy to see that they imply a certain bias . they suggest that size and duration , qualities that depend on scale , are qualities with meaning , qualities that can help describe an object or classify it . ... scale is important . " james gleick , chaos : making a new science ( p. 107 ) when scale is the problem we first heard about the psychology of scaling several years ago during a david grove workshop . david talked about the " inappropriate scaling " of a perception . he noticed that client 's metaphors sometimes presuppose an out - of - proportion - ness , often between the perceiver and what they are perceiving . a classic example is : " i 'm overwhelmed . " when the client examines their perception they usually report that the symbol representing them is small relative to what is overwhelming . when asked " and that 's overwhelmed like what ? " they reply with " a huge wave knocking me over , " or " being buried under a mass of paper , " or " thousands of arrows coming straight at my heart . " other common examples of metaphors that imply a problem of scale are : bighead over cooked out of proportion too big for his boots eyes too big for my belly i bit off more then i can chew an old head on young shoulders making a mountain out of a molehill the bigger they are the harder they fall weight of the world on my shoulders you 'll never amount to anything it 's bigger than the both of us diminished responsibility big fish in a small pond a drop in the ocean in over her head under valued tracing the source of an inappropriately scaled perception may sometimes lead to a traumatic event . the radical psychiatrist and author of the divided self , r. d. laing , described how he avoided feeling the pain of being beaten by his father by imagining his mind was a tiny point outside his body . scaling events in a particular way will have been useful and adaptive at the time -- the system made the best choice it could -- but this may result in unwanted consequences in the long term . fortunately we can learn to re - scale our perceptions so that we more appropriately perceive our interior and exterior worlds . david grove says that when an inappropriately proportioned perception becomes " life - size " relative to the age / size of the client , you know a significant change has taken place . definitions of scale according to collins dictionary , there are several interrelated meanings for the noun ' scale ' : a sequence of marks either at regular intervals , or representing equal steps , used as a reference in making measurements ; or a measuring instrument having such a scale . the ratio between the size of something real and that of a representation of it ; or a line or number for showing this ratio ( e.g. the scale on a map ) . an established standard ; or a relative degree or extent . common to these definitions is the relative or referential nature of a scale . they enable us to rank or measure things by finding a comparable attribute or characteristic . a scale can be digital ( discontinuous ) or analogue ( continuous ) and usually has ' upper ' and ' lower ' thresholds or boundaries . scales can be classified by what they measure : time ( duration , frequency ) , space ( distance , area , volume ) and form ( temperature , brightness , loudness , hardness , speed ) as we shall see below . scales of time one of the most ubiquitous of all scales is time scale . we mistakenly tend to view ' clock time ' as reality independent of human perception , forgetting that it was not until november 18 , 1883 that the notion of a standard time was imposed by the railway companies of the usa , and that a global , uniform method of determining and maintaining accurate time signals was not instituted until 1912 . after studying t he culture of time and space 1880 - 1918 , stephen kern concluded : the introduction of world standard time had an enormous impact on communication , industry , war , and the everyday life of the masses ; but explorations of a plurality of private times were the more historically unique contributions of the period . the affirmation of private time radically interiorized the locus of experience . ( p. 313 ) the malleability of personal time is the basis of many nlp ' timeline ' therapeutic techniques . in his study of metaphors of time scale david grove noticed that people often have a consistent unit of time which they use to identify certain classes of events -- a personal " time signature " . in other words , there is a pattern to the way a person ' punctuates ' ( or ' segments ' or ' chunks ' ) time . examples of how these units of time are revealed linguistically are : it came to me a flash . it was over in an instant . a split second later it was gone . everything changed in the blink of an eye . i got angry just like that [ click of fingers ] . in that moment everything became clear . give me a tick to think about it . it happened in a heartbeat . my whole life changed that day . i was born between the wars . i 've had this problem for donkey 's years . i 've wanted it for aeons . when expressions like these are explored with clean language they invariably prove to be containers of great significance for the client . scales of space the notion that things are located in space is fundamental to our perception of both the material and the imagined world . locating anything anywhere requires the measurement of both distance and direction , and hence a scale . below are just a few of the many metaphorical expressions which presuppose that the spatial scale of a perception is having a major effect on the meaning the speaker is making : i 'm out of my depth . it 's a long , long road . we 're being left behind . there 's no turning back . he 's too close for comfort . i need more space to think . nothing can come between us . give them an inch and they 'll take a mile . this company is heading in the wrong direction . one small step for man ; one giant leap for mankind . scales of form as soon as we notice that an attribute or characteristic can be used to compare things , we will have ( consciously or otherwise ) created a scale . this is true whether we have noticed something that is easily measured like height or weight , or something less easily compared , like happiness or artistic expression . once we perceive differences on a continuum we have scaled them . scientists and engineers often invent devices to measure and quantify our subjective scaling : attribute noticed measuring device scale wind speed wind gauge beaufort scale ( mph ) earthquake severity seismometer richter scale atmospheric pressure barometer millibars scales can involve multiple parameters . a ' light year ' uses speed , distance and time . one of our favourite examples of the marriage of a quantitative and qualitative scale is the fujita - pearson scale which measures tornado destructiveness ( a function of maximum wind speed , path length and path width ) : 0 - light 1 - moderate 2 - considerable 3 - severe 4 - devastating 5 - incredible if we can make distinctions we can create a scale to measure those differences . a local news reporter who was interviewing commuters going home after work asked " how tired do you feel on a scale of ' completely knackered ' to ' fresh as a daisy ' ? " . what is amazing is not that she asked such a question , but that people could answer it ! submodalities and scale if you are trained in nlp , you might be wondering how ' submodalities ' relate to the scale of a perception . submodalities are the qualities associated with the sensations and ' internal representations ' of seeing , hearing , feeling , tasting and smelling , e.g. size of picture , volume of sound , or intensity of feeling . many nlp change techniques involve varying one or more of these submodalities . in other words , they adjust the amount of the quality : making the picture bigger / smaller , the sound louder / quieter , or the feeling more / less intense(see andreas & andreas , bandler , dilts & epstein , gordon ) . not only are each of these perceptual qualities scaled , they are scaled relative to each other so that they ' naturally ' fit together into a unified perception which makes sense to the client . once you are aware of the notion of scaling you can facilitate your clients ( preferably using clean language ) to become aware of : the scale being used and the means of measuring it . where ' what is being measured ' is currently ' registering ' on the scale . the ' ends ' of the scale and when they are ' approaching a threshold ' or ' going off the scale ' ; and then what happens ? meanwhile you can consider : if every internal representation is scaled to accommodate the information it includes , how does the scale affect the meaning the client gives to it ? how does the client 's process of scaling contribute to maintaining the current pattern of behavior ? how much flexibility do they have to change the scale of their perceptions -- especially at times of stress ( ie . near to a threshold ) ? indicators of scaling once we started to look for indications of scale we saw / heard them everywhere . for example , when we reviewed one of our client transcripts we were surprised to discover that the client had indicated the importance of scale in almost half of her replies . following are statements extracted from the beginning of the transcript which have a ( more or less obvious ) reference to scale . can you identify the words in each sentence that presuppose a scale ? c1 i got in touch with an ideal being . c1 it 's hard to bring her out . c3 she 's a very strong presence . c3 i 'm a little bit scared . c7 it could be so much better . c10 it becomes safer . c11 i become stronger . c12 more present . c13 i got a picture of a really strong oak tree . c14 the big strong oak tree . c16 it 's the best of both worlds . c17 i can be more like her . c17 i do n't seem so separate . c18 i feel much more peaceful . c27 it 's really pretty . c31 i can almost hear her say ... ( the full transcript entitled the jewel of choice is available at www.cleanlanguage.co.uk ) in addition to words , people use repetition , intonation and especially gestures are to mark out the scale of a perception . patterns of behavior can also reveal some rather fixed notions of the ' proper ' scale of things . for example : - how much time do you allow to get to a meeting , or to catch a plane ? - what do you consider ' early ' , ' late ' or ' on time ' ? - what kind of calendar do you prefer ( day / week / month at a glance ) ? - how far ahead to do you plan ? - how much ' personal space ' do you need to feel comfortable ? - how far do you need to drive for it be a ' short ' or ' long ' journey ? - how much food or drink do you consume before you 've had ' enough ' ? once we recognized the significance of scaling , we saw it as a general phenomenon of ' the structure of subjective experience . ' any comparison / judgement other than a simple on / off or black / white distinction presupposes a scale . given how often we make comparisons and judgements , scale would seem to be fundamental to the way we perceive the world . the role of scale in the change process perhaps the best known use of scaling in a therapeutic context is from solution - focused therapy . in its simplest form , you first ask the client where they currently are on a scale of 0 - 10 ( where ten represents the client 's desired outcome and zero stands for when the problem is at its worst ) . you then ask the client to describe being at the next higher point on the scale and what they need to do to get there . steve de shazer says " our scales are designed primarily to facilitate treatment . our scales are used not only to measure the client 's own perception but also to motivate and encourage , and to elucidate goals [ and ] solutions . " ( p. 92 ) solution focus has designed a predetermined scale for the client . its value is its simplicity and universality . however there is another way to make use of scaling . our approach , symbolic modelling , facilitates clients to notice the way they unconsciously and idiosyncratically use scale to organize their perceptions . becoming aware of how they scale gives their system an opportunity to organically adapt toward increased well - being . through modelling the ways clients change the scale of their perceptions , we have concluded that a translatory ( first order ) change occurs when there is a shift within the existing scale : something that is too big , shrinks ; or too low , raises ; or too close , gets further away ; etc . however , a transformative ( second order ) change becomes possible when there is a change to the scale itself . as james gleick says ...

brian kelly recently gave a talk on this subject at the internet librarian international 2005 conference . in this article he expands on the talk and revisits the question as to whether email really should disappear . the ili 2005 conference the ili ( internet librarian international ) 2005 conference [ 1 ] , the seventh in the series , was held in the copthorne tara hotel , london over 10 - 11 september 2005 . this conference is aimed at information professionals and librarians who are using , developing and implementing internet , intranet and web - based services in their daily work . one of the main themes at the conference explored at the conference was the potential for technologies such as blogs and wikis within a library context . i took part in the opening session on this theme and explored the potential for several new technologies and associated strategies . email must die ! following the opening keynote presentation , the conference split into three parallel tracks . i took part in track a on blogs , wikis , and collaboration tools . the other speakers in this track were michael stephens , st. joseph county public library , indiana , usa , who spoke on " tools for digital collaboration " [ 2 ] and aaron schmidt , reference librarian , thomas ford memorial library , illinois , usa , speaking on " digital tools for collaboration " [ 3 ] and who described the potential of applications such as flickr and del.ico.us . michael stephens , brian kelly and aaron schmidt , speakers in the opening track . following these two presentations which outlined the potential of several areas of collaborative web - based networked applications , i gave a presentation entitled " email must die ! " [ 4 ] . this provocatively titled presentation was intended to challenge the notion which may be felt by some that use of such new collaborative technologies will be restricted to well - funded organisations in the us or the technology enthusiasts . the talk gave a critique of email and outlined areas in which new collaborative technologies may provide a better alternative to email or other established working practices . in the talk i pointed out that many of the tools are easy to use , often , in the case of open source applications , with no licence costs to act as a barrier to their use . i then outlined a number of areas in which such technologies could be used . this article expands on the ideas given in the talk . a critique of email email has , of course , proved to be an essential tool for use within the higher education sector , especially for those involved in the development and provision of networked services . email has developed from providing a simple mechanism for communication between two people with the widespread use of emailing lists and the ability to send attachments . sadly the effectiveness of email seems to have decreased with its more widespread usage . many users treat email as an instant response technology , resulting in subject lines which are unhelpful when subsequently ( perhaps much later ) trying to find a relevant message : the poor use of metadata with email can also be a barrier to managing messages . despite the provision of message filtering rules in many email clients , such management capabilities do not appear to be widely deployed - and are always liable to fail when systems are not correctly configured ( ever see " on holiday " messages sent to mailing lists ? ) . such limitations have led to the argument that " e - mail is where knowledge goes to die " [ 5 ] . the majority of users of email will have , of course , have received spam . spam - or unsolicited commercial email ( uce ) as it is also known - is probably the most annoying aspect for email users today , hindering the productivity of email users . a range of options although the limitations of email are widely recognised , it should be acknowledged that email does have advantages : users are familiar with email and email clients , and email is widely used to support business processes . however we should be looking at areas in which other technologies may provide a more effective solution to our business processes than email or other existing solutions . i will now outline a number of relevant collaborative technologies and discuss areas in which their use may be applicable . instant messaging instant messaging ( im ) technologies will be familiar to many . im appears to be a cult fashion for many young people , and its use is growing with the increasing uptake of broadband in homes . organisations are under pressure to provide instant messaging capabilities : some provide a range of im tools ( e.g. the university of liverpool [ 6 ] ) while others have concerns over the additional pressures this may place on scarce pc equipment , support implications , etc . although there are legitimate issues regarding the provision and management of such technologies , instant messaging can provide a useful tool for users . the jisc - funded qa focus project , provided by ukoln , based at the university of bath and ahds , based at king 's college london , made use of instant messaging for formal meetings and in a more informal way . in order to ensure effective use was made of this form of workshop a policy on instant messaging was produced [ 7 ] and a case study summarised the background to this approach [ 8 ] . instant messaging can also be used in environments in which email would be inapplicable . for example , during the session at the ili conference , instant messaging was used between myself and a member of the audience . this enabled me to be reminded of issues i could use shortly before i gave my talk . potential concerns regarding use of instant messaging include distractions such as beeps as colleagues arrive and leave instant messaging environments and archiving of discussions held using instant messaging technologies . simple solutions to such concerns include familiarising oneself with the capabilities of the applications , in order to disable sounds and archive messages - or simply to make use of the tools in contexts in which such issues are not relevant . such issues are mentioned in the qa focus briefing document using instant messaging software [ 9 ] . rss a significant use of email is for making announcements . there will be many occasions in which providing news feeds using rss ( really simple syndication / rdf site summary ) will provide advantages over use of rss . use of rss should allow the end - user greater flexibility in finding , managing and processing such announcements . if you enjoy receiving news from the bbc , rather than subscribing to a bcc email service you may find that subscribing to a bbc rss news feed provides greater flexibility in managing the information . with many rss readers you can choose how often to process new rss items and how the information should be displayed . if you wish , you can receive your rss news feed within your email client - email clients such as mozilla thunderbird provide rss viewers as standard [ 10 ] and rss extensions for microsoft outlook are available [ 11 ] [ 12 ] . an advantage with this approach is that you do not have to wade though out - of - date news when you return from holiday . it should also be noted that email and rss need not be regarded as isolated technologies . a number of mailing lists applications , such as yahoogroups , provide rss feeds of the archives of the lists . an example of use of the sage rss viewer to view summaries of messages in the rss - dev yahoogroups list [ 13 ] is shown in figure 2 . viewing an rss feed from a yahoogroups mailing list rss feeds are available for the jiscmail archives , but unfortunately the content of mail messages is not syndicated , only the address of the messages , which means that the approach described above can not be used for jiscmail archives . blogs readers of this article will , no doubt , be familiar with blogs . but how do blogs relate to use of email ? we can illustrate some of the possible benefits by searching for reports on the ili 2005 conference . using google to search for " ili 2005 " and " ili2005 " we find that , excluding results related to the main ili 2005 conference web site , many of the search results come from trip reports published in blogs by speakers and delegates at the conference [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] [ 18 ] . for speakers at such conferences , who typically have a remit to maximise exposure to their ideas , it would seem that use of blogs to gain exposure is likely to be more effective than sending reports to mailing lists ( of course , the information could be transmitted over both applications ) . wikis a wiki is a collaborative web - based authoring environment [ 1 19 ] . wikis aim to be easy to use , requiring no special software to be installed and providing a simple markup language which is easier to use than html . i have been using wikis for some time now . one area of use is when collaborating with co - authors on a paper or proposal . in the past this would typically involve passing , for example , a microsoft word document around the co - authors . use of the wiki helps to avoid many of the problems associated with this process , such as multiple copies of the file being distributed , different ways of using the application , etc . i have also used wikis in the planning of events . again rather than having to search across email messages , a wiki is used in conjunction with email lists . email is used to gain consensus on ideas ; once this has been obtained the wiki allows members of the event team to collaborate on the development of relevant documents . voice over internet protocol ( voip ) the skype internet telephony application [ 20 ] is another technology which i use in a number of ways . skype has been used at several events recently ( including the eunis 2005 conference and the institutional web management workshop 2005 ) to allow remote participants to listen in to talks . skype is also being used with co - authors of papers to discuss ideas in a more interactive fashion than is possible when using email . the audio discussion is complemented by use of skype 's instant messaging capabilities for purposes such as sharing urls . must email die ? so should email disappear ? the answer is , of course , no . email will continue to have a role to play in many areas . however there will be areas in which alternative approaches may have advantages over email . organisations should ensure that they are prepared to have an open mind regarding the potential of new technologies , particularly in areas in which existing practices are well established . the technology should not , however , by forced upon the user community , but instead provide a more effective solution for its users . it should be noted , however , that in some cases the user community may be ahead of the service providers . a survey on policies on the use of instant messaging ( im ) was carried out on a ucisa mailing list some time ago . one institution stated that " im ... is ' here to stay ' - an ' unstoppable tide ' . seen as part of youth culture , along with ... sms " whilst another commented that " s tudents will arrive familiar with , and expecting to .. use such tools . email seen by younger people to be ' boring ' , ' full of spam ' , im and sms immediacy preferred . " [ 21 ] from this perspective the question to be addressed could be " will email die ? " rather than " should email die ? " from these comments it would appear that a significant part of our user community regard email in a similar fashion to how many long - standing internet users may regard usenet news ! however a danger with end - users driving such technological innovation is that issues such as interoperability , support , records management , etc . may be ignored . these are important issues and so institutions will need to ensure that such considerations are being addressed . references internet librarian international ( ili ) 2005 conference , 10 - 11 october 2005 http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue28/web-focus/ tools for digital collaboration , m. stephens , ili 2005 conference http://www.tametheweb.com/presentations/toolsms.pdf digital tools for collaboration , a. schmidt , ili 2005 conference http://www.walkingpaper.org/presentation/tools/ email must die ! , b. kelly , ili 2005 conference http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/events/conferences/ili-2005/talk-1/ e - mail is where knowledge goes to die , transforming information into knowledge at the portal , bill french , 22 april 2000 http://myst-technology.com/mysmartchannels/public/item/5994 instant messenger faqs , computing service department , university of liverpool http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/helpdesk/faqs/instant/ policy on instant messaging , qa focus policy document , ukoln http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/qa/policies/instant-messaging/ implementing a communications infrastructure , qa focus case study no . 12 , ukoln http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/documents/case-studies/case-study-12/ using instant messaging software , qa focus briefing document no . 56 , ukoln http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/documents/briefings/briefing-56/ thunderbird , mozilla http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/ newsgator business http://www.newsgator.com/business.aspx read rss in outlook , intravnews http://www.intravnews.com/ rss - dev , yahoogroups http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/ list of bloggers , internet librarian international 2005 unofficial wiki http://ili2005.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/main/bloggers ili 2005 , science library pad http://scilib.typepad.com/science collaboration tools session at ili2005 , marydee ojala http://www.onlineinsider.net/2005/10/collaboration-tools-session-at-ili2005.html email must die ! karen blakeman http://www.rba.co.uk/rss/2005/10/email-must-die.html ili2005 : emailen er d � d ... , internets � gning , ( in danish ) http://erikhoy.blogspot.com/2005/10/ili2005-emailen-er-dd-lad-os-begrave.html an introduction to wikis , qa focus briefing document no . 78 , ukoln http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/documents/briefings/briefing-78/ an introduction to audio and video communication tools , qa focus briefing document no . 79 , ukoln http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/qa-focus/documents/briefings/briefing-79/ unpublished report , university of edinburgh . author details brian kelly uk web focus ukoln university of bath email : b.kelly@ukoln.ac.uk web site : http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ return to top article title : " web focus : must email die ?

to spend time alone with his heavenly father . luke tells us that jesus had just returned from such a time of prayer , and so it was natural for them to ask , ' lord , teach us to pray . ' as a result of that request we have what we call ' the lord 's prayer ' . the prayer is our lord 's teaching and our lord 's pattern concerning prayer . it is how we should pray . the lord 's prayer was not given as a literary masterpiece to be viewed and admired . nor is it a beautiful set piece to be recited morning by morning as if the lovely words would infuse a beauty into our lives but had no practical meaning or bearing on the way we live . it was given to be a pattern and basis of prayer for real people in the real world . it is the pattern our lord has given his disciples . even then it is not simply a recitation or a set prayer but truly a whole house of prayer with many rooms to explore . each room opens to us a different aspect of god 's world , the world for which we are called to pray . beware then , of rushing around the house from room to room simply ' checking them off ' . but rather , take time to walk from room to room and bring before our heavenly father , the people , the contents and the views , both near and far , of each room in turn . we begin with just the first phrase , ' our father in heaven , ' or , ' father , ' as it is in the earliest copies of luke 's gospel . here is the grand entrance hall in which we are introduced to the king . our lord teaches us straight away to whom we should pray and , indeed , who may pray in this way . to whom should we pray ? our lord was teaching his hebrew disciples to pray , and the hebrew people were very proud of abraham their father . abraham was the friend of god . abraham was successful in pleading with god to spare cities . it would have been quite natural , from their point of view at least , for our lord to have taught them to pray : ' father abraham , friend of god , plead for us , pray for us . ' but he did not do that . there were other great spiritual leaders , for example moses . when god spoke to ordinary men , he spoke to them from a distance , but when god spoke with moses he spoke with him face to face . so it would have been natural , again from the disciples ' point of view , if our lord had said , ' pray like this : " father moses to whom has been given the privilege of speaking with god face to face , pray for us , intercede for us , pray on our behalf . " ' but again , he did not . the same of elijah , that great man of god by whose passionate prayers came drought , fire and rain : ' elijah pray for us , intercede on our behalf . ' our lord nowhere teaches us to pray in this way , and there is an enormous lesson here straight away . if we would be disciples of our lord jesus , and are willing to submit to his teaching , we will not offer our prayers to those old testament saints or to their new testament counterparts . in this prayer our lord offers us a privilege far , far greater . we are not invited to come to a mere servant of god , no matter how great a spiritual giant he or she may have been . we are invited to come with boldness into the very presence of the god and father of our lord jesus christ ; invited to speak with almighty god himself . the invitation is absolutely overwhelming . how dare we ? we certainly may not by any merit or right of our own . but , through his son , the lord god invites us , as we pray , to come into his awesome and royal presence ; indeed , we are called to do so with boldness , and by express invitation . once we have understood the greatness and amazing privilege of such an invitation , to refuse would be as unthinkably rude as receiving an invitation to a royal reception or garden party but , on the occasion , actively choosing to speak only with the servants . how should we address almighty god ? then further , we are taught to approach almighty god as ' our father in heaven ' . this again is something absolutely wonderful ; that we , mere mortals , are invited to address the sovereign lord of all the universe as ' father ' . the hebrew people of our lord 's day knew almost nothing of this intimate knowledge of god . and in our own day and culture , for a variety of reasons , many people find it very difficult . we think more easily of god as an impersonal cosmic force , or maybe the pattern set by our own father is a great stumbling block . however , the privilege of christ 's disciples is that we may know god , the sovereign lord , as our heavenly father ; the best and greatest of fathers , who loves and cares for us . the apostle paul puts it even more strongly when he says that those who have the spirit of our lord jesus can address god the creator as ' abba ' , ' father , my father ' . that is the privilege of disciples of our lord jesus . we can , in a real sense , be sons and daughters with the freedom of approach seen in a little child with a loving parent . we are taught to come with boldness to the creator king , our heavenly father who loves us , longs for the very best for us and provides for our every need . who may pray like this ? here is a prayer for disciples of our lord jesus . he came to his own people , writes the apostle john , and they did not receive him . they rejected him . but to those among them who received him he gave the power , the right , the authority to be the sons and daughters of god . those in our own day who are given this right and privilege , are also those who receive the lord jesus ; those who are willing to trust him for who he is and for what he has done ; willing to learn what he commands and willing to do it . these , and only these , are the true disciples of christ and to them is given this great and glorious privilege . . . to be the sons and daughters of god . the family prayer finally , do notice that the prayer begins with the little word our , not just my father but our father . the one who hears equally the cries of the strong man or the little child , the prince in his palace or the poor man cast out . he , our father , hears the cry of the prisoner as clearly as the cry of the free , the prayers of the despised as gladly as the prayers of those held in high public esteem . true disciples of the lord jesus , no matter what their earthly circumstances , are no more , and no less , than sons and daughters of the living god and are invited to come with equal boldness , and with equal humility , as brothers and sisters into the very presence of god . the squire and the stable hand , the president and the plumber , the carpenter and the king , disciples met behind cottage doors or cathedral doors - ' our father ' . here truly is common prayer , a prayer common to disciples from every nation , tongue and tribe , a prayer for the smallest child and a prayer for the strongest leader , a prayer for those who have the responsibility of great wealth and for fellow disciples who do not even know whether there will be a next meal . when we truly begin to grasp that our fellow disciples , no matter what their earthly circumstances may be , are our brothers and sisters in christ , it will begin to move our hearts with god - like compassion as it challenges us to give and forgive , to share and to care for those around us . in beginning to pray the lord 's prayer , pray just this first line , ' our father in heaven , ' and then , before moving on , think about it . pause and reflect into whose presence we are invited to come with such boldness . step back and in wonder reflect that we may speak with the lord god himself . recall at what cost that privilege was bought ; reflect with the apostle paul that , ' the son of god loved me and gave himself for me . ' if you pause and consider these things you may well be moved to worship , and moved in wonder and love for god who gave his only son for you . filled with awe and wonder , prayer begins to come alive ; prayer to our father in heaven who cares passionately about this world and its people ; who cares enough about us to make us his children . ' father , give us a due sense of awe and wonder at the greatness of this your invitation . set our hearts ablaze in wonder and thanksgiving that in your unchanging love and mercy you gave your son , your only son , that we , together , might be sons and daughters of the living god .

rom edition with additional functionality is also available . the caxton 's chaucer site is the outcome of one of a number of digitisation projects for early printed material held by the british library . on caxton the mercers ' company , the london guild of wholesale merchants to which caxton belonged , is no longer a guild , but the mercers ' company is still in existence , and several of the documents relating to caxton are still to be found in its archives . portraits of some of the persons mentioned on the british library 's caxton web resource can be found on the web pages of the national portrait gallery , for instance edward iv , richard iii and henry vii . you can also see a portrait of louis de gruuthuse who protected edward iv when he was in flanders . his magnificent town house still stands and is now a museum . information on the technique of printing can be found on several websites , for instance a resource on type making has been made for the huntington library . you will also find usefull information at the site of the gutenberg museum in mainz , and the british library 's own web resource on gutenberg . on the history of papermaking , especially in england , see the british association of paper historians . the museum in the old paper mill in basel has a short virtual tour , as does the italian paper museum , which has some information on the important early italian paper making ; see also the american museum of papermaking_nnp _ _ unix man pages : unix ( 7 ) note : click here if you get an empty page . unix(7 ) linux programmer 's manual unix(7 ) name unix , pf , af , pf , af - sockets for local inter- process communication . synopsis # include < sys / socket.h > # include < sys / un.h > unix = socket(pf , type , 0 ) ; error = socketpair(pf , type , 0 , int * sv ) ; description the pf ( also known as pf ) socket family is used to communi- cate between processes on the same machine efficiently . unix sockets can be either anonymous ( created by socketpair(2 ) ) or associated with a file of socket type . linux also supports an abstract namespace which is independent of the file system . valid types are sock for a stream oriented socket and sock for a datagram oriented socket that preserves message boundaries . unix sockets are always reliable and do n't reorder datagrams . unix sockets support passing file descriptors or process credentials to other processes as ancillary data to datagrams . address format a unix address is defined as a filename in the filesystem or as a unique string in the abstract namespace . sockets created by socketpair(2 ) are anonymous . for non - anonymous sockets the target address can be set using connect(2 ) . the local address can be set using bind(2 ) . when a socket is connected and it does n't already have a local address a unique address in the abstract namespace will be generated automati- cally . # define unix 108 struct sockaddr { sa sun ; / * af * / char sun ] ; / * pathname * / } ; sun always contains af . sun contains the zero - termi- nated pathname of the socket in the file system . if sun starts with a zero byte it refers to the abstract namespace maintained by the unix protocol module . the socket 's address in this namespace is given by the rest of the bytes in sun . note that names in the abstract namespace are not zero - terminated . socket options for historical reasons these socket options are specified with a sol type even though they are pf specific . they can be set with setsockopt(2 ) and read with getsockopt(2 ) by specifying sol as the socket family . so enables the receiving of the credentials of the sending process ancillary message . when this option is set and the socket is not connected yet an unique name in the abstract namespace will be gen- erated automatically . expects an integer boolean flag . ancillary messages for historical reasons these ancillary message type are specified with a sol type even though they are pf specific . to send them set the cmsg field of the struct cmsghdr to sol and the cmsg field to the type . for more information see cmsg(3 ) . scm send or receive a set of open file descriptors from another pro- cess . the data portion contains a integer array of the file descriptors . the passed file descriptors behave as like they have been created with dup(2 ) . scm send or receive unix credentials . this can be used for authen- tication . the credentials are passed as a struct ucred ancil- lary message . struct ucred { pid pid ; / * process i d of the sending process * / uid uid ; / * user i d of the sending process * / gid gid ; / * group i d of the sending process * / } ; the credentials which the sender specifies are checked by the kernel . a process with effective user i d 0 is allowed to specify values that do not match his own . the sender must specify its own process i d ( unless it has cap ) , its user i d , effective user i d or set user i d ( unless it has cap ) , and its group i d , effective group i d or set group i d ( unless it has cap ) . to receive a struct ucred message the so option must be enabled on the socket . versions scm and the abstract namespace were introduced with linux 2.2 and should not be used in portable programs . notes in the linux implementation , sockets which are visible in the filesys- tem honour the permissions of the directory they are in . their owner , group and their permissions can be changed . creation of a new socket will fail if the process does not have write and search ( execute ) per- mission on the directory the socket is created in . connecting to the socket object requires read / write permission . this behavior differs from many bsd derived systems which ignore permissions for unix sock- ets . portable programs should not rely on this feature for security . binding to a socket with a filename creates a socket in the file system that must be deleted by the caller when it is no longer needed ( using unlink(2 ) ) . the usual unix close - behind semantics apply ; the socket can be unlinked at any time and will be finally removed from the file system when the last reference to it is closed . to pass file descriptors or credentials you need to send / read at least one byte . errors enomem out of memory . econnrefused connect(2 ) called with a socket object that is n't listening . this can happen when the remote socket does not exist or the filename is not a socket . einval invalid argument passed . a common cause is the missing setting of af in the sun field of passed addresses or the socket being in an invalid state for the applied operation . eopnotsupp stream operation called on non - stream oriented socket or tried to use the out - of - band data option . eprotonosupport passed protocol is not pf . esocktnosupport unknown socket type . eprototype remote socket does not match the local socket type ( sock vs. sock ) eaddrinuse selected local address is already taken or filesystem socket object already exists . eisconn connect(2 ) called on an already connected socket or a target address was specified on a connected socket . enotconn socket operation needs a target address , but the socket is not connected . econnreset remote socket was unexpectedly closed . epipe remote socket was closed on a stream socket . if enabled , a sig- pipe is sent as well . this can be avoided by passing the msg flag to sendmsg(2 ) or recvmsg(2 ) . efault user memory address was not valid . eperm the sender passed invalid credentials in the struct ucred . other errors can be generated by the generic socket layer or by the filesystem while generating a filesystem socket object . see the appro- priate manual pages for more information . see also recvmsg(2 ) , sendmsg(2 ) , socket(2 ) , socketpair(2 ) , cmsg(3 ) , socket(7 ) credits this man page was written by andi kleen . linux man page 1999 -

century griesbachians and twentieth - century markan priorists ) . the christological argument for markan priority emerged within british scholarship as a means of defending markan priority and explaining matthean alterations of mark . although this particular argument has played a relatively small role in supporting the structure of the two source hypothesis ( 2sh ) , several factors suggest its contemporary importance and the need for a critical assessment . the most important of these factors is the revival of the gh , which has involved criticisms of the arguments used to support the 2sh . these criticisms have , in turn , prompted from markan priorists a re - assessment of the arguments from wording , order and content . within this context it seemed appropriate and necessary to reassess arguments from christological development , a notion that was also appealed to by nineteenth - century defenders of the gh . in chapter two , after a survey of proposed criteria for determining literary priority , we argue that a method which focuses on redactional plausibility and coherence is both appropriate to the christological material in view and able to treat the two major hypotheses in a relatively even - handed manner . thus the discussions of the texts involve a comparison between the plausibility of markan redaction , assuming the gh , and the plausibility of matthean redaction , assuming the 2sh . any alternative method would involve the assumption of a particular pattern of christological development within the early period . our method , however , focuses on the texts we do have , rather than the pattern of development which we do not . it also allows both hypotheses to be tested in relation to their treatment of christologically - loaded material . it allows this dissertation to test both whether the traditional argument should be regarded as a strong support for markan priority , and whether the gh might be able to give a more plausible picture of redactional behaviour . thus the two major hypotheses ( 2sh and gh ) are compared in order to assess which provides the best explanation ( in a comparative - redactional sense ) of the evidence . the investigation proper takes as its ausgangspunkt two passages which were at the heart of the historical christological argument ( described in chapter one ) . we compare the 2sh perspective and then the gh perspective on the passages concerning : the rich young ruler ( three ) and jesus ' rejection at nazareth ( four ) ; and then the walking on water ( five ) . this investigation suggests that the commonly held view that matthew avoids christologically embarrassing phrases does not provide a sufficient explanation of matthean redactional behaviour . nevertheless , the 2sh is able to provide ( at least for two of the three passages ) a more plausible and coherent explanation than the gh . chapter six deals with the issues of jesus ' emotions , questions , and inability ( highlighted in chapter one ) which all involve ( on the 2sh ) matthean omissions from mark . chapter seven deals with other areas of the matthean redaction which have been claimed as a support for markan priority ( � worship ' and � approach ' terminology and the passion narratives ) , which all involve matthean additions to mark . the focus in these chapters is to test this material in order to evaluate the claims of markan priorists . in many cases the gh explanation is found to be equally plausible ( e.g. on the passion narratives ) , and the christological interests of matthew have been exaggerated ( e.g. on � worship ' and � approach ' terminology ) . this conclusion leads to the following chapters in which an attempt is made to compare the evangelists ' treatment of major christological themes , using the christological titles as convenient loci for study . in chapter eight we argued that the 2sh makes much better sense of the treatments of jesus as teacher and as lord than does the gh . matthean redaction of mark ( on the 2sh ) can be described as both coherent and plausible on several levels , especially in relation to the ot , in a way that could not be said of griesbach - mark . in chapter nine we again concluded , concerning the presentation of jesus as messiah , that the redactional activity of matthew envisaged by the 2sh was both coherent and pervasive and plausibly understood as a re - appropriation of jewish and ot categories for matthew 's situation . in chapter ten we investigated the treatment of jesus as the son of god . in this case several specific problems were noted in relation to the redactional procedure of griesbach - mark which were not present in matthew 's redaction of mark ( 2sh ) . a similar conclusion was drawn from the son of man material ( chapter eleven ) . in both cases matthew 's redaction of mark involves an increased appropriation of ot allusions in service of the tradition . these chapters form the basis , therefore , for a renewed christological argument for markan priority , based not on what matthew omitted from mark , but on the coherent , plausible , pervasive and positive redactional alterations made by matthew in his re - presentation of the markan traditions . in several places , however , the redactional activity envisaged for griesbach - mark could have been construed in terms of a developed but previously misconstrued secrecy motif . it therefore proved necessary to investigate the secrecy material with a view to assessing whether this material could be more plausibly explained by the gh ( chapter twelve ) . we concluded , however , that this material did not offer a key which would explain griesbach - mark ; on the other hand the 2sh generally offered a reasonable and coherent picture of matthean redaction activity in this area . the conclusion summarises the course of the discussion and offers three major conclusions : i ) that the christological argument as traditionally conceived does not offer a compelling argument for markan priority ; ii ) that the gh is generally unable to provide a plausible explanation for the behaviour of griesbach - mark in this area ; and iii ) that a re - formulated christological argument focusing on the positive christological emphases of matthew is a powerful argument in favour of the 2sh over the gh ._. _ _ on a county map , including only a few miles from north to south and east to west , having surveyed places on the ground they can be plotted simply . town positions can be treated as cartesian ( x , y ) coordinates in miles , and can be plotted as on an ordinary graph , x across and y up . it is not necessary to use the complicated geometry of a map projection . most of old hampshire mapped does not investigate map projections . beyond some simple ideas outlined below the subject is decidedly technical . the identification of the projection used for maps is beyond the analysis that we wish to do ; we hope that the reliable digitised images , supplied in the ' raw ' image files and which can be used for measurements , will enable the user of the website to explore this sort of thing . but the user should be warned : the early maps are not super accurate in the first place , so measurements from them may have errors which obscure what projection was used ; the map maker may not have used a projection to make his map , but have applied , somehow or other , lat and long scales to a plot copied from an even earlier map . ngr national grid references simple cartesian x , y plotting is how coordinates in the national grid reference ( ngr ) system have been designed to work . the projection that lies behind the system is well described in publications from the ordnance survey and others ; it is a modified transverse mercator projection . the ngr system is a very convenient , comprehensible tool . only excepting the funny coding of the coordinates ; a two letter coding for 100km squares , and an unseparated sequence of numbers for smaller eastings and northings . the ngr system is metric . a typical grid reference:- su907568 is ( 490.7,156.8 ) that is 490.7 km east , 156.8 km north of the ngr origin . some gis software prefers the values in metres . more figures can be given , giving a more accurate position reference . hampshire hampshire lies in parts of 100km squares su and sz , whose bottom left , sw , corners are , respectively , 400km east 100 km north , and 400km east 0km north , of the system 's origin out in the atlantic ocean . hampshire is encompassed by a box , defined by 10km squares:- sz09 at bottom left to su86 at top right not all the ( 9x8 = 72 ) 10km squares contain bits of the county . using the national grid system a 1 mile x 1 mile square of land is 1 unit x 1 unit on the map , for everyday purposes . as a consequence of the projection used , if latitude and longitude are shown , the parallels are slightly curved upwards at the ends , concave to the north ; meridians are straight but inlcined inwards towards the system 's central meridian , 2 degrees w. magnetic north is inclined by an amount which varies over time , noted on the published maps . the ngr system has been in use since the 1930s , with a preceeding military british grid system dating to 1919 , modified 1927 . indexing index grid an entirely different sort of grid appears on some maps , an index grid which marks off the map 's sheet of paper into convenient labelled cells by which to find a place on the map from a list . john norden 's map of hampshire , 1595 , has such an index grid ; it was then an innovation in map making . the map borders are marked off in 2 mile intervals , labelled 2 .. 48 from left to right , and a .. x ( no i , no u ) from top to bottom . this is not a plotting device but a handy reference device . rectangular rectangular lat and long latitude and longitude can be used very simply for plotting by setting up a rectangular grid ; this is a simple cylindrical projection or plate caree : but . at the equator a degree of latitude is roughly the same length in miles as a degree of longitude - ignoring the asphericity of the earth 's globe . at the equator , a square grid would be satisfactory for a small map . half way up the globe , where hampshire lies , a degree of longitude is shorter in miles , though a degree of latitude is much the same . a square grid here distorts distances , the map is stretched e - w. the lat long grid has to be rectangular rather than square to give a true picture of everyday miles . for hampshire , roughly at the 51 degree n parallel:- 1 degree latitude = 69.13 miles 1 degree longitude = 43.62 miles ratio = 1.585 the ratio approximately corresponds to the inverse of the cosine of the latitude ; 1/cos(51 ) = 1.59 . the real figure allows for the asphericity of the earth which is an oblate spheroid not a sphere . the miles in a degree of latitude also vary with latitude because of the oblate shape , but not much over the size of a county . dower 1838 dower 's map of hampshire , 1838 , has rectangular latitude and longitude scales in its borders ; the bottom scale labelled:- longitude west from greenwich the ratio of latitude to longitude scales is about 1.57 . this is equal within errors to the value for the latitude of hampshire . useful numbers at 51 degrees n the following values are useful:- 1 degree latitude = 69.13 miles 1 degree longitude = 43.621 miles 1 minute latitude = 1.152 miles 1 minute longitude = 0.727 miles 1 mile = 0.868 degrees latitude 1 mile = 1.375 degrees longitude radius of earth = 3960.8 miles trapezium trapezoid projection the length of a degree of longitude is different in the north of hampshire compared with the south . hampshire is within latitudes 50d 40 m to 51d 25 m n. latitude 1 degree longitude degrees minutes miles 51 25 43.23 20 43.31 15 43.39 10 43.46 05 43.54 51 00 43.62 55 43.70 50 43.78 45 43.85 50 40 43.93 the figures are based on a table supplied by the hydrographic office , to whom thanks . they are extracted from admiralty publication np240 . the ratio of the length of 1 degree longitude at the north and south of hampshire is 0.98 , a 2 percent difference . this is hardly important for a hampshire county map and is smaller than the errors of plotting of early maps . if it is necessary , for a map that extends further north - south , a quick fix to improve the plotting is to use a trapezoid projection . the north and south borders of the map are both straight horizontal lines on paper , divided equally in minutes of longitude , but the north border has smaller unit lengths . meridians are drawn by straight lines joining up corresponding points . parallels are drawn horizontally straight across the map sheet joining divisions on the latitude scales on the sides . the outline shape is a trapezium . saxton 1579 the trapezoid projection was first used by donis nicolaus germanus , a german benedictine monk from reichenbach , for maps in editions of ptolemy 's geographia , from 1466 onwards . it is sometimes known as a donis projection . the lat long scales on christopher saxton 's map of anglia are like this , the map of england and wales is the general map for his set of county maps published 1579 in its second state , 1590s . the county maps do not have lat and long scales . marshall 1798 mr marshall 's map of the western districts of the southern counties , including hampshire , 1798 , has what might be a trapezoid projection . lacking the graticule we can only make an assumption that that the meridians would have been drawn straight . the 1 degree w meridian would be vertical on the page ; other meridians sloping in towards it at the north . the parallels are horizontal on the page . the ratio of longitude scales top / bottom is 1.14 , the expected ratio for the scales on this map , 50d 30 m to 51d 28.7 m n , is 1.02 . the average ratio lat / long is 1.60 , about the expected value for a ' square ' map at 51 degree n. parallelogram slantendicular lat and long it is an additional problem that magnetic or compass north is not the same as north defined by a meridian line . the magnetic north pole is not at the rotational north pole of the earth . even worse the magnetic pole shifts over time . if a map maker wants to plot a map with compass north at the top the lat and long scales will have to be drawn on the slant . they can be rectangular and rotated , or trapezoid and rotated , or perhaps just sheared into parallelogram instead of rectangular cells , and perhaps even sheared and rotated . robert morden 's scales are probably sheared and rotated . harrison 1788 john harrison 's map of hampshire , 1788 , has latitude and longitude scales printed in the borders and a graticule is printed across the map at 5 minute intervals . it has parallelogram latitude and longitude scales , sheared rectangular scales . the parallels are aligned horizontally on the page ; the meridians are 2.6 degrees e of n. the ratio of lat / long scales is 1.16 which would stretch the county 36 percent e - w. 1 mile x 1 mile on the ground becomes 1.37 units x 1 unit on paper . it is likely that harrison copied a map and applied lat and long scales to it . applied afterwards nota bene in all cases be aware that just because an early map has lat and long scales does not mean that places were plotted using these scales , using positions found from astronomical observations . if a map was copied from some earlier map the lat and long scales might just be added afterwards ! the seemingly incorrect lat and long scales found on an old map scales might be the scales that best fit a pre - existing plot . north on some maps has been estimated as part of the exercise to fit an index grid ( the national grid system ) to an old map . this process is described in the notes for the software used , oldmaps.exe . reading references steers , j a : 1965 ( 14th den ) & 1927 : introduction to the study of map projections : university of london press harley , j b : 1975 : ordnance survey maps , a descriptive manual : hmso & ordnance survey chamberlin , w ( et al ) : 1950 : round earth on flat paper : national geographical society hinks , a r : 1942 ( 2nd edn ) : map projections lee , l p : 1944 : nomenclature and classification of map projections ; empire survey review : vol.7 : pp.190- � martin and jean norgate : 2003 email:- jandmn@norgate.freeserve.co.uk old hampshire gazetteer , old hampshire mapped and other projects on cd_nn _ _ please use this search box to perform a name search or an email search for a member of staff . you can perform the following types of searches . use a minimum of three characters in your search string . this will recognise those characters found anywhere in the name you are looking up .

mark moore : thinking on public value emerged from the kennedy school around 20 years ago , when we started teaching public sector managers . we decided that we would prepare to teach by constructing a theory of public sector leadership and management that started with practice and worked up , rather than starting with theory and working down . consequently , we invited practitioners to become part of the faculty , young faculty members went to serve in government , we wrote up cases of managers operating in various situations and , perhaps most importantly , we met large numbers of public sector executives through our executive program classrooms . as head of the executive program i spent a long time listening , and wrote up what i had learned . my book � creating public value ' , published in 1995 , has served as a continuing basis for our executive education . at the core of the idea was the notion that we had to talk about the purposes of the public sector manager , and the instruments available to them . language around this idea had previously centred on efficient , effective accomplishment of the mission of the organisation , and the protection of public interest . but there was something missing � the private sector is always looking to create value for shareholders and workers , and there seemed to be no equivalent for the public sector in models of corporate strategy . what if the job of the public sector executive were to find and create opportunities for public value � an idea stripped of its financial basis , stripped of individual material success ? in the private sector the answer is quite straightforward � customers making the decision to spend their money with you . what makes the government scenario different is that it is n't the individual customer who ascribes value , it is the collective who , through the process of government , makes a commitment to tax and regulate themselves for the purposes of producing a change in the material conditions of society . this became the idea behind public value . the idea found itself in opposition to the idea of � customer - orientated ' government because it was n't clear from the latter whether the customer was the client with whom it interacted , or whether it was citizens and society representatives . consequently , an important part of being an effective manager involved orchestrating a coherent conversation in the collective around what should be produced , as well as figuring out how to produce it . once you 've added entrepreneurship and facilitating conversations to ideas of innovating in pursuit of improved service delivery , you 've got a different idea of the role of the public sector executive , and the skills required . ds : does your model for public value resonate in the us ? mm : yes it does . as well as being about creating value , it is also about a set of ideas designed to guide management thinking along strategic lines . we developed the idea because we were looking for an idea to animate people to do a better job , but i also thought we had developed a concept of corporate strategy made simple for public sector application . my new job at kennedy involves working in the not - for - profit sector , and a comparison of public and private sector corporate strategy models suggested that ours was the more applicable to not - for - profit purposes . like government , not - for - profit organisations have third - party funders from whom you need to get � legitimacy and support ' , and to whom you must demonstrate value in non - financial terms . ds : with regard to legitimacy and support , i 'm sure that the public sector is the more complicated environment . has there been much uptake of your � public sector ' model in the private sector ? mm : no and it 's very frustrating . strategically , i do n't think the private sector knows what to do with politics . ds : do you think that would apply to private sector organisations delivering public services ? mm : what is interesting is that , in order for a contractual relationship to work well , the public sector organisation must define the value that it wants the private sector organisation to produce . that is the basis of the contract . but if government is unable to define the value it wants to produce , then the contract wo n't work . you come back to the fundamental problem in government � mobilisation of the collective to be articulate and clear about what it wants as a reflection of what it aspires to , and how to measure it . ds : the national school is to be repositioned within government as a non - ministerial department . what might the concepts of public value and legitimacy and support mean for us , given that we will be � owned ' by departments ? mm : it 's an interesting strategic challenge . in the past your principal clientele comprised individuals looking to improve their skills , with courses paid for by personnel departments in existing organisations . in that model , if people make good judgements about what they need , and you provide good courses , then over a period of time organisations will improve . with your new approach , your clients are strategic managers within organisations who feel accountable for the short and long run of their organisations rather than the development of individuals . the challenge , then , is to put in their hands the instruments they need to deliver on strategic objectives . ds : i suspect the sunningdale institute has a big part to play in helping me and the organisation to get the necessary legitimacy and support . mm : the fellows are an extraordinary group of people , and i think it would be a missed opportunity were they not to make a sustained material contribution to the development both of a research curriculum , and to the national school faculty itself . i believe you have the resources and the mandate to make it work ._. _ _ it 's almost here ... ' dyeing for a change : current conventions and new futures in the textile colour industry ' , better thinking 's report on the impacts of textile dyeing , is about to be uploaded ! click here to download it ! the report simplifies and summarises almost everything we read and found out about all the different ways to colour fabric . although a lot of what we waded through was highly scientific , we 've tried to simplify it for you . the report looks at why we need to address the environmental impact of dyes , then goes on to list the impacts , advantages and disadvantages of conventional dyeing techniques and possible alternatives . other treatments and chemicals used to treat textiles are also covered , and some interesting things we found out are contained in six appendices . most of the other methods we looked at involve complex processes and machinery , turning impact reduction into a set of complicated tradeoffs . however , we found out about a little - known ancient dyeing method which is brilliantly simple , eliminating the need for scary chemicals , complicated equipment or super - thirsty dye and rinsing cycles . although not every colour will be available , we will be able to choose from a varied palette , which includes some really bright , punchy ones . to ensure that the performance of our chosen method lives up to the hype , we 'll need to carry out some experiments . and we 've taken on an intern to help us : as of next week , sarah murphy , a fashion student at central st martin 's , will be coming in solely to focus on the project , so expect developments to speed up a bit and keep checking back to see how it 's all coming along ! just fill in your details to download the report ! name : organisation : email address : email addresses will not be displayed on the site nor passed on to any other parties how happy can a colourful t - shirt make you ? tricky question , it depends on who you are and what you like . a better question might be how much happier can it be make you if it 's made in a environmentally considerate way ? this month , we made it our mission to find out everything we possibly could about colouring a t - shirt . what 's surprising is that even though we still do n't know everything there is to know , we seem to be well on the way to uploading one of the most comprehensive documents on dyes and their environmental impacts onto the web . we felt it important to research this issue because the negative impacts of dyeing take on many shapes and forms ; conventional dyes are made from finite resources such as petroleum , require large amounts of water , pollute waterways and kill aquatic life , as well as presenting health risks to factory workers and end users . not good . and sadly , this part of the story is often overlooked , even by traditional ' eco ' clothing manufacturers . it felt especially important draw attention to the issues , find out what we could and share this knowledge with as many people as we can . so we found out everything we could about every applicable dyeing method ... direct dyes , fibre - reactive dyes , sulphur dyes , vat dyes , natural dyes , dirt dyes , naturally coloured cotton , sunbleaching , closed loop systems ... and were disappointed to find out how few people could point us in the right direction . it 's understandable , given how little information currently available and how confusing all of it is . but knowing our t - shirt could n't be perfect unless we tackled the issues head - on , we had to do the best we could . even though there was n't enough information to fully weigh up the pros and cons of every dye method , we feel we 've come up with the most informed , considered approach offered by any garment maker to date . this approach follows a rule of ' the simpler , the better ' . we 've decided to offer a limited selection of colours , as the more colours available , the more complicated the footprint calculation and supply chain . we narrowed the choice down to three types of shirt : the first being for the most hardcore eco - types , avoiding the impacts of dyeing altogether by being completely undyed . for those with environmental interests but also aesthetic concerns , we want to offer one bright colour , such as deep red or sky blue . and for business or more formal occasions , we also want to produce a black version . in terms of what to use to obtain these colours , a good principle to stick to seems to be keeping it as natural as possible . even if it 's not perfect now , we 'll be providing a boost to this area , meaning it 'll improve and become a more viable competitor to scary chemical dyes in the future . with these decisions made , we can take on our next set of challenges : firstly , the most socially and environmentally sound way of producing and dealing with this dye . the next challenge is to work out how to make these colours stay bright or strong -- they may be better in environmental and social terms but synthetic dyes still outperform them aesthetically . and the challenge after that challenge is who can actually dye the shirts for us -- as we keep discovering , what 's theoretically possible , what 's actually possible and what 's realistic in the world of functioning businesses are many , many worlds apart . the document 's not quite finished yet but you can send your email address to perfect@betterthinking.co.uk and we 'll let you know as soon as it 's done . and in the meantime , as per usual , if you have anything to add , we 'd love to hear about it -- this project 's all about improvement through involvement . ok , so the blog has seemed a little quiet recently , but things have been very very busy doing paid work for exciting clients . we 've put the rare , spare moments we 've found to good use though , in the form of sourcing more factories as well as putting together a major report that simplifies extremely complicated information on the impacts and effectiveness of various dyeing methods . we 'll upload it as soon as we 're confident we know all the details ... watch this space ! the perfect t - shirt has entered a new stage of life ! we always knew that the perfect t - shirt would involve not one , but several different possible approaches to minimising the footprint of the world 's most universal garment . we 've mapped out four very different types of perfect t -

shirts and nuzzled by enthusiastic dogs as katharine told us about her perfect t - shirt . which , somewhat unsurprisingly , is a katharine hamnett t - shirt . more specifically , it fulfils her essential criteria of paying farmers a fair wage , spinning , knitting and stitching the shirt in the same area to reduce ' clothing miles ' , being comfortable , and avoiding being ' too fashion ' . organic cotton 's the only material for her , as , in her opinion , even the finest hemp is too scratchy for a t - shirt and the process used to turn bamboo into fibre uses too many harsh chemicals . we then moved onto a small discussion about cotton , which challenged one of my thoughts on the subject . recently , i 've been thinking that if we 're to set a blueprint for the industry , we should use a crop that can be just as sustainable on a global scale . even though we 've found almost entirely sustainable rain - fed organic cotton , as all the cotton in the world can not be rain - fed , i 've been having doubts about using it for our shirt . however , katharine stated that 100 million farmers work with cotton and it 's responsible for 10 % of agriculture and 25 % of its pesticide use . as cotton is such a classic , comfy t - shirt material , would n't it be great to help turn such a massive industry round ? i ended up thinking i 'd be happy for us to use organic , rain - fed cotton at this point in time as long as someone can develop a method of irrigating the oh - so - thirsty cotton ( 20,000 litres of groundwater per kilo of harvested fibre ) by the time pesticide - free cotton begins to be used on a global scale . as well as growing her fabric in india , katharine 's cotton is also spun and stitched there , as it produces the most advanced jersey fabric in her opinion . we found out it costs about � 4,000 for a farm or co - operative to be certified as organic , which must be discouraging farms from becoming certified . katharine passionately believes that the developed world should pay this cost : after all ' it 's one world ' . and then , somewhere behind one of the rails of trendy t - shirts , a phone rang , katharine had to carry on with her busy , glamorous life , and we had to return to the real world . posted by cate and the darth vader phone began to spill out a wealth of information on all things ecological � yes , it was kate fletcher at the other end of the line , telling us she 's been impressed with the rich variety of opinion uncovered by the forum so far , and giving us some definitive answers for things we 'd been looking into . she began by shattering our dreams : there 's no hemp being grown in the uk that 's of a sufficient quality to be used for garments . she told us of the many hurdles she went through trying to make clothing locally for a project in the 90s , involving weeding and cutting a hemp crop by hand , transporting the crop to the closest processing plant ( in belgium ! ) where it had to be adapted to fit into a machine designed to process a different crop , and then transported to northern ireland , the closest place where spinning could occur , all to be transported back to southern england . a quick masterclass in how hemp is processed was next on the schedule . the useable fibre of the hemp crop grows in the centre of the plant , and is accessed by rotting away the unwanted parts , more attractively known in the industry as � retting ' . there are lots of ways to do this : using chemicals , something exciting called � steam explosion ' , water retting and field retting . despite sounding pleasant and ecologically sound , water retting is actually responsible for polluting waterways . hence field retting , where the crop is left out in the field to decay naturally by dew and bacteria , is the best . and in passing , another exciting thing was mentioned : sunbleaching ! understandably it does n't lead to as bright a whiteness created by nasty chemicals , but it 's a possibility that we definitely need to look into . before she had to rush off and carry on her hectic schedule , we were thrown one more factlet . if the t - shirt does n't take to the air but is instead shipped using , erm , a ship , its carbon footprint for transportation will be minute . that means we can look further afield to find the factories and farms that we feel are making the biggest difference . so with a few more avenues of exploration to wander down and a clearer idea of how to navigate them , we disconnected from the world 's ugliest telephone to continue on our epic journey � posted by cate having declared that we 're going to take every positive and negative social or environmental effect into account whilst making the t - shirt , we decided it was about time we actually wrote down what they might be . they 'll help us compare our t - shirts to other companies ' to make sure we 're really pushing the boundaries . resisting the temptation to neurotically question what the employees in the factory eat and how many dogs they own , the list of core questions takes up four a4 pages . we 've listed some of them for you below , but we 're aware there 's probably a whole load of other issues we 're still missing . if there 's anything you think we may have overlooked , please get in touch . what material(s ) is the t - shirts made from ? what environmental certification(s ) , if any , does the farm have ? where is the material grown / formed ? how quickly does it grow ? what happens to the parts of the crop that are not sent off to be turned into t - shirts ? how much water is needed to grow the crop and where does this water come from ( eg irrigation , rain - fed , etc ) ? how much pesticide and fertiliser is required ? how is it disposed of ? what social certification(s ) , if any , does the farm have ? how much does the farmer receive for his crop ? how much do other farmers in the region receive ? are farmers educated about the dangers of any chemicals and machinery that they use ? what is the age range of the workers ? what is the average age ? how is the material transported to the processing plant ? how is it prepared for transportation ( eg what is it packed in ? is it sprayed to protect against pests ? ) how is the plant powered ( eg conventional electricity , on - site solar power , green electricity tariff ) ? how much water is needed to process the material and where does this water come from ? how is the material processed ? what chemicals or treatments are involved ? how are these neutralised and disposed of at the end of the process ? what dyestuffs are involved ? what chemicals and treatments are involved in the production of these dyes ? does the site adhere to ethical trading initiative labour standards ? how much are employees paid , on average ? what is the regional average ? are employees free to join trade unions and groups ? do employees receive regular , comprehensive equipment training ? is there a decoration on the t - shirt ? what is it made of ? how are the colours added ? how is it produced and how are this process 's wastes dealt with ? how is it applied ? how is this machinery cleaned ? how long will the decoration remain attractive ? where are the t - shirts sold ? how are the t - shirts transported to point of sale ? how are the shops powered ? how are the t - shirts displayed ? what are the hangers made from ? how is the t - shirt packaged ? can it be reused or recycled ? are customers discouraged from using a bag ? how many times can the t - shirt be worn before it requires washing ? how is it washed ? is any effort made to reduce how much the customer washes it ? how does the fabric behave ? how comfy is it ? how desirable is the t - shirt ? is it popular ? what happens at the end of the t - shirt 's life ? is this considered when the t - shirt is designed ? if it goes to landfill , how quickly does it break down ? what is released during the decomposing process ? if it is recycled , how is this done ? how is it transported to the recycling plant ? what is the material turned into and what processes and chemicals are involved in this ? how are the business 's offices powered ? which of the companies financial services ( eg banking , pension and insurance ) are provided by an ethical banking service ? what has the company prioritised for how it can improve its products and the way it does business ? is any part of the business carbon neutral ? what does a t - shirt sell for ? how does this break down ( workers ' wages , transportation , marketing budget , profit and so on ) ? posted by cate what do dead sparrows have to do with t - shirts ? nothing whatsoever . but sadly , what to do if you find one in your garden was the most precise information we managed to uncover during several phone conversations with organisations that we thought should and would know better . the perfect t - shirt is now at a stage where we need specific companies and individuals that could help us to put the t - shirt in production once we 've committed to a final specification . so we contacted the carbon trust , defra , the dti and the sustainable development commission to find out : are any factories in the uk ( or europe ) that make t - shirts and are powered by renewable energy ? preferably not just a green tariff but on - site renewables like wind , solar or wave power . is anyone in the uk making yarn from flax or hemp that 's been grown organically in this country ? surprisingly , across all these organisations no definitive answers where forthcoming . we were simply redirected from one web site to another , full of positive principles but no practical advice whatsoever . it ironically seems far easier to answer questions about sustainable practice in japan than in the uk . from our earlier research for example , we already know that there are factories in japan powered exclusively by on - site renewables where you can buy fabric made from organic cotton and bamboo . it 's bad enough that the uk economy probably does n't have such glowing eco - credentials - it 's even worse that you ca n't find anyone to give a definitive answer as to what sustainable resources are available here and who 's providing them . the most helpful people by far were the sustainable development commission . their main focus is advising government , so i wo n't give you the name of the kind and informative person i spoke with there or he 'll be inundated with the wrong kind of questions ! he still could n't provide definitive answers to our questions , but he did n't try to pass the buck and he also offered to forward an email to their ' roundtable ' committee . so fingers crossed we might get some tangible input soon . it seems that if uk plc is to adopt a truly sustainable mindset and get beyond short - terms tactical solutions and greenwash , we would all benefit from a one - stop sustainability shop . a place where you can find out how to turn your positive principles into positive actions . but with enough specific details that you do n't have to waste half your life on fruitless phone calls trying to find the small number of suppliers who are actually already set up to operate sustainably . a resource like this certainly does n't exist at the moment - maybe someone should set one up ? tony , gordon , david - if you 're interested you can mail us for some ideas : help@betterthinking.co.uk . or maybe there 's already something in the pipeline we do n't know about ? posted by mike our t - shirt project gained us access to development house , a building full of ngos doing all sorts of wonderful things . we were led past the only fairtrade vending machine i 've ever seen to meet damien sanfilippo , cotton project coordinator for pesticide action network uk . he pointed out that in addition to having the world 's smallest eco - footprint , our t - shirt could also be used as a force of positive change . turkish organic cotton is great , but growing it in west africa will be more socially beneficial , as it has more potential to boost income and quality of life whilst promoting gender equality , biodiversity and food security . damien felt these benefits justify the extra energy required to transport it a bit further to its point of sale . one of the benefits of organic cotton grown in west africa is that it is entirely rain - fed . this means that no irrigation whatsoever is needed , not even ground water , making the crop very close to being completely sustainable . the cotton in west africa is often hand picked and transported on animal carts instead of relying on the fossil powered machinery more common in the us and turkey . damien is in touch with small scale organic cotton farmers in senegal , who would also be able to spin and knit the fabric there , providing environmental benefits in the form of requiring less travelling , and mental health benefits for us in the form of a simpler supply chain . another interesting part of the meeting was the realisation that even though organic cotton is grown without any chemicals , caustic soda is needed to remove the wax so it can be spun and woven . the waste water produced during this process then requires more chemicals to be added to it so it can be neutralised . this rather shocking discovery made us realise there is a long way to go before the true organic t - shirt , which uses no synthetic chemicals at any point in the production process , is brought into existence . we were also shown some examples of naturally coloured cotton grown in peru which eliminates the need for nasty dyes . damien told us natural dyes are pointless as these fade after three or four washes . he showed us some that 's made in peru . we were shown a range of samples of naturally coloured cotton . they looked alright ; if we used different shades of cotton to put a funky design on the shirt then it could be considered trendy , despite using colours traditionally only worn by hippies . the only problem is the naturally coloured cotton is grown in peru , and the socially beneficial farms , which grow cotton that requires dye , are in senegal . the best solution 's in there somewhere , but where ? ! ? posted by cate ok , it does n't really , it 's a very sustainable , low - impact crop with many incredible applications - but at the moment we 're not convinced that it 's right for the perfect t - shirt . ( it wo n't count as perfect if only hippies want to wear it , will it ? ) we have busy been uncovering some other sustainable possibilities though . from locally - sourced ( linen woven from scottish flax ) to socially - beneficial ( organic cotton produced with zero emissions in west africa ) there are many considerations to assess and evaluate . we 're now starting to build several different scenarios for fabrics and logistics , and the next step is to identify potential design and manufacturing partners . and we can already imagine the equal measures of fun and frustration in store when we get to think about cut , colour and styling ! posted by mike it 's a shame , hemp is an extremely sustainable crop that can be used for clothing , paper , housing insulation and biomass fuel , but it 's never really taken off because most of those involved in the industry spend far too much time being stoned ! gav lawson , a refreshingly down - to - earth businessman and one of the owners of thtc ( the hemp trading company ) told us that once he 'd found our studio after a long walk in the cold . although hemp may not be the most comfortable or fashionable material to use ( it looks a bit rough and ready , though i 'm yet to wash my new shirt a few times ) , it 's an extremely environmentally friendly material : hemp fibre is very strong and durable , and requires no pesticides or herbicides due to its natural resistance to insects and weeds . and it gets better � hemp can replace a proportion of cotton used in many instances , reducing the frightening levels of chemicals cotton production is responsible for : the crop is the most pesticide - intensive on the planet , occupying 2.4 % of arable land yet requiring 24 % of the world 's insecticides . but it does n't stop there ! we could even pack the t - shirt in hemp : research is being carried out using hemp in biodegradable plastic products . talk about succumbing to hemp - tation ... posted by cate we 're getting stuck into the real nitty - gritty details of sourcing and standards . we 're now in contact with an american university who have developed a fabric treatment that repels dirt and odours . and we 're working our way through the soil association 's list of certified organic textile manufacturers and importers . it 's great to get a very hands - on perspective of some of the difficulties and trade - offs - but it was n't entirely reassuring that my first phone call to an organic textile manufacturer was to someone who only makes tampons ! well , it certainly lightened up our thursday afternoon ! let 's see what next week brings ... posted by mike i 've spent the past week trying not to get too starstruck as i 've gone about meeting more of the people of my � impressive eco people ' list . friday afternoon was spent in cyndi rhodes ' shared studio space in angel , finding out about her anti - apathy project and hearing how she collaborated with terra plana to bring the super trendy yet more ethical worn again shoes in existence . and yesterday we had a coffee with karin , blake and kate from interface , the world 's leading carpet tile design , manufacturer and seller , both in terms of sales and sustainability . it was fantastic just to meet these people , let alone have them share their knowledge learnt whilst developing and producing industry - changing products and business models . however , the meetings did make me feel the fear again , as we learnt that both companies have had to make compromises in order to bring their products into existence . these compromises were clearly worth making because they meant their pioneering products could be brought into reality , a crucial step to setting an example to other businesses and making them begin to change their act . the problem with our project is that every impact must be considered , meaning we have to justify each and every tradeoff we 've made . my sense of dread at this complex task was justified when blake said that � measuring tradeoffs is like comparing apples to oranges ' : there are thousands of variables affecting each potential impact , taking years to accurately assess , at the end of which the state of play will have completely changed and you 'll have to start again . it was a strange relief to hear confirmation that calculating tradeoffs is such a world of pain , although it did n't help to think we were now undergoing an impossible task . but mike pointed out if there are so many complex calculations to be done , what we need to do is simplify the system . he suggested making everything in this country , instantly minimising the distance materials and products need to travel , eliminating the need to audit factories due to the uk 's strong laws and automatically ensuring workers have a much better quality of life . it 'll be interesting to see what price this t - shirt will be , but as the guys from timberland pointed out , although we may be used to t - shirts costing between � 5 and � 25 , if the cost of ensuring every process is ethically sound results in a � 200 price tag , then that is what 's reasonable . posted by cate i think it feels hard at the moment because we want to do so much . we want to get tangible results reasonably quickly , to help this feel like a real working project with a real outcome . but we also recognise that every aspect of the project needs to be considered in infinite detail . it 's about getting the right balance between pragmatism and idealism . of course , we do n't even know yet how people will respond to the perfect t - shirt once it 's available . will they really appreciate something that is produced in a markedly different way to a more conventional t - shirt ? we 've established some basic principles of our methodology . we want to end up with a real t - shirt that people can buy . we do n't want to be hide - bound by convention . we need to engage people at every step . we need to retrace our steps and challenge everything again at every point . we want to make progress . we want to break the mould . we need to end up with more than just an art project . this is n't ( only ) about just proving a point . possibly the way we can reconcile these diverse and conflicting goals is to pursue more than one avenue at the same time , as if they could all exist in perfect harmony . so , we can imagine the most perfectly incremental t - shirt at the same time as envisioning the most perfectly radical t - shirt . one thing that stands out at this point in our journey , is that we need to be scared . if we are n't in awe of the scale and volume of the challenges facing us , the incredible amount of knowledge that we need to absorb and process � then we 're doing something wrong . well , by this measure , for the time being we 're on the right track . posted by cate we 're in the observer ... take a look ! a couple of discoveries that make any t - shirt , or any garment for that matter , more sustainable � first of all , ecoballs ! the mineral pellets inside these balls produce ions which lift dirt away without damaging the fabric . at � 35 , they 're quite an investment , but that buys you 1,000 washes - 3.5p a go , which ca n't be bad . by avoiding detergent , you 're not releasing harsh chemicals into the water supply , and doing anyone with skin problems such as eczema a favour . and another eco - tip that can be applied to your entire wardrobe : 80 % of the energy used to wash garments is needed to heat the water . the colder you can wash something , the more energy you save and the less damage you do to your clothes . washing in cold can save you between � 30 and � 100 a year in fuel bills � enough for those ecoballs . posted by cate mark loved the grey one cos of the shape , i loved the blue one cos of the colour and the cool design ! ecojiro is the quirky character used to promote kirin beer 's environmental activities . he 's ridiculously cute , making me feel proud to wear a positive symbol of reducing my impact � exciting and ethical all at once . these shirts remove the common issue that fun must be sacrificed for ethics . if we can make a t - shirt that makes people feel good by being more ethical , the shirt will move one step closer to perfection . back in the real world , it does seem that being as ethical as you can be does come at a personal cost , at least for now . in the nature of being completely good rather than less bad , we want to use only treatment products that are completely free from any concerns about causing birth defects , genetic mutations or cancer . of 8,000 chemicals used in fabric manufacture , only 38 currently meet our standards . and of 1600 dyechemicals available , only 16 are approved by the epea as sound for health and environment , enabling us to produce shirts in red , purple , orange , white and a load of pastel shades in between . which brings us to the question of sacrifice : will people object to brilliant blue , green , yellow and black being unavailable ? a lot of this is based on the consumer 's mindset . if people really begin to value ethical living , a combination of understanding and the availability of other positive options should mean they wo n't miss certain colours . we could make a selling point of the fact it 's not available in blue , green , yellow and black , helping people be proud not to wear these colours through our own positivity . posted by cate our ideas have taken another interesting turn after reading ' cradle to cradle : remaking the way we make things ' . the book states that if things are designed so their materials are kept in a completely closed loop or degrade completely safely , there is no reason why we ca n't keep acquiring the latest , most stylish objects . it suggests designing a cup that breaks down quickly and safely , that contains nutrients that would fertilise the ground . you 'd be able to feel good about throwing it out of a train window , and councils would want the nutrients on their land to the extent they 'd put up little signs saying ' please litter ' . of course , there 's no reason why we ca n't design a t - shirt according to the same principles . a lot of research and thinking will be needed as to the best ways to implement them : should people be able to chuck it into their gardens ? should they return it to us where we put it into a special ' t - shirt wormery ' ? might it be available in non - tree hugging shades ? we 're also quite disbelieving that this solution is really so simple , and expect to hit problems as soon as we explore the options available to us , but it 'll be interesting to find out how many obstacles there are and whether we can help remove them . another thought we had is that one way to get around the issue of users disposing of their garments when they get bored of them is to think outside the conventional system of buying clothing . what about a t - shirt bank , a system in which users rent t - shirts they like and return them whenever they feel like trying something different ? this would involve fabrics that could withstand multiple washes , users who understood the t - shirts may not look brand new the first time they wore them and a realisation that some years there may be a lot of demand for one type of shirt , and in others they may just gather dust in the warehouse . the main advantage over personally owning one perfect t - shirt is that the t - shirt bank does n't eliminate the concept of fashion and change , and gives users a bigger wardrobe than they could ever achieve single - handedly . issues of ownership and personalisation also come up : how do you say a t - shirt from the t - shirt bank is ' you ' ? maybe it just requires a different attitude to clothing ; understanding that if we are to live more ethically we have to use things differently and therefore think differently about them . after the initial discussion of materials and dyes , we got into somewhat less technical issues : what would our perfect t - shirt look like ? to avoid the number one threat to t - shirt longevity , that of being thrown away because the user does n't like it anymore , we need to make sure it 's a staple of the user 's wardrobe . one after another , everyone at the table described their perfect shirt , at which point we realised it was different for each of us . mark wanted a basic , baggy , black , square shirt that he 'd never have to worry about replacing , kate fletcher wanted something fashionable and fitting , mike also wanted something more fitting but masculine . i did n't know what i wanted but i felt i 'd know when i saw it . we figured each user 's perfect cut is as individual as they are . kate felt the perfect t - shirt is also the most personal t - shirt : it needs to be individually designed and produced , to make the shirt truly appropriate to the user 's needs and give him or her a sense of attachment to the object . however , mike and mark want to make the t - shirt available to as many people as possible at a reasonable price : they felt mass production was needed and that the choice should be limited to a men 's and women 's cut available in both white and black . maybe the title of the project has now changed to ' the perfect mass - produced t - shirt ' . well , we never said it would be easy , and the first stage of our perfect t - shirt project proved this to be somewhat of an understatement : more than making each stage of the product lifecycle as environmentally sound as possible , the project is going to involve challenging every assumption we 're tempted to make . we met dr kate fletcher , an expert in the field of more sustainable textiles , who armed us with some excellent information and reminded us a design 's impacts are sometimes not where you 'd expect them , for example , by telling us laundering accounts for 85 % of a garment 's impact . hence one possible solution is a t - shirt which only requires occasional washing . kate also suggested a range of exotic sounding materials : instead of organic cotton , bamboo , ingeo and lyocell were shortlisted . as we continued , we realised our product will never truly be the perfect t - shirt : each material and production method still has an environmental impact . some materials need less energy to grow than others but more chemicals to process them , some less impactful materials are less tactile and so on . the t - shirt needs to be a favourite : rather than shirts wearing out , most t - shirts are discarded because the user gets bored with them . hence it may be worth the more resource - intensive process of dying or bleaching a shirt rather than leaving it a more natural but unconventional ecru colour . it 's about understanding the tradeoffs and making the most appropriate choice from what 's available at this point in time ._. _ _ about us > what we do what we do the national energy foundation is an independent educational charity , based at milton keynes in the uk , controlled by an eminent board of trustees . its objective is to work for the more efficient , innovative , and safe use of energy and to increase the public awareness of energy in all its aspects . currently it is working in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency . renewable energy the foundation has a team of seven working on advice , information and training projects . these include : the renewable energy for the home helpdesk , call 01908 665555 ; energy for good -

budget films , i was quickly made aware of the fact that i had neither the skill , determination or energy to occupy any position within a film crew , and my potentially scorsese - esque talent failed to materialise . however , i still knew that i loved films , so decided to embark on a film theory ma which would allow me to work with film but with half the effort needed on a more practical course . as well as curing my aversion to any film that has n't come out of hollywood over the past 30 years , the ma gave me a new found knowledge and the irritating habit of being unable to watch a film without analysing it to death . i am now pursuing my dream of being paid to watch films , but even if i do not reach my ambition , i will still forever more enjoy watching a sunday afternoon matinee with a cup of tea and large packet of chocolate biscuits . my highly unoriginal , embarassingly hollywood -

fi and bad comedies , which soon morphed into a foolish desire to see every movie in the world ever made . it also inspired me to write and direct my own epic movies plantamania and devonshire crocodile which , alas , failed to spark a nouvelle vague style film revolution . favourite films of the moment include aliens , a room for romeo brass , dazed and confused , do n't look now and � at the risk of destroying any hint of credibility � labyrinth . adrian mackinder editor ( read reviews | read filmmaking | read news reports ) adrian flounders around london and does n't really know what he 's doing . since graduating in ' 99 he has dabbled in pretty much anything he can , from television production , journalism , comedy writing and presenting his own doomed pilot tv show to working on live events , camerawork and selling terrible furniture in highgate to people with more money than sense . the only constant in his life has been jaffa cakes , yop and bill murray , and is unapologically defiant in his view that the phantom menace was not shit and considers the matrix to be turgid , pompous twaddle . at the moment his favourite films are alien , the wicker man , once upon a time in the west , the exorcist and manhattan . raam tarat editor ( read reviews | read filmmaking | read news reports ) films , movies , cinema ... call it what you may - it had me from " hello " my earliest memories were of watching vintage indian films at home in the early 80 's . i soon traversed over to hollywood blockbusters ... deliverance finally came in the form of the wonderful cinema paradiso . a movie that showed me how powerful this form of storytelling could be ; taking me to a completely different place - much like toto . i realise this analogy is a tad barf - inducing , i digress .. i love good movies , period . amongst my favourites are eternal sunshine of the spotless mind , three kings , the shawshank redemption , dil chahta hai and rang de basanti . chris evans editor ( read reviews | read filmmaking | read news reports ) after a promising start with two scripts made into short films in the us , it became a bit of a struggle with my film writing experiences limited to features for a monthly business title . not to be deterred i decided to take the bold step of travelling to south america and working as a film reviewer for the santiago times in chile , despite not being able to speak the lingo . my intention now is to carry on writing reviews , annoying my friends with endless film analyses and criticising my dad for loving standard british fare like bridget jones and notting hill . my top ten films , although ever changing , will always be devoid of staple hollywood blockbusters . currently they are : city of god , leon , officers ward , shawshank redemption , monty python 's life of brian , dumb and dumber , amelie , stand by me , belleville rendez - vous , and shine . johan de silva webmaster ( read reviews | read filmmaking | read news reports ) a designer by profession johan is constantly evolving future movies by making the site look good and usable as well as doing all the programming . his favourite films are rain man , scarface(1983 ) , city of god , blade runner ( the directors cut ) , and donnie darko . his web portfolio is at www.johandesilva.co.uk and like many at future movies available for interesting work . guest editors laura douglas reviews richard strachan reviews kieron o'sullivan reviews joe green reviews | filmmaking lizzie bruce reviews kenny hogart reviews merlin harries reviews bruce munro paul gallagher reena tailor itv1 -the web review ' ' there 's a naive charm about this site . it 's got the kind of integrity that its board run contemporaries could never buy , no matter how much they spent . if you like film or you 're handy with a cam , perhaps it 's time to look into the future .

global water shortages we are facing a global water crisis : over 1 billion people lack access to water , and 3,900 children die each day from water related diseases . the nations of the world have committed themselves to the millennium development goal [ mdg ] of halving the number of people without access to water by 2015 . but we are failing to tackle this challenge . the extension of water provision is simply not happening on the scale or at the pace necessary to deliver the water mdg , especially in sub - saharan africa . it seems increasingly clear that we can not look to the private sector to deliver this goal . in fact , according to the recent un world water development report ( 2006 ) , ' many of the multinational private water companies have started to retreat from water service contracts and investments in developing countries ... ' , a significant investment in finding and funding workable public solutions to the global water crisis is now the only viable route to delivering the mdg . i hope , therefore , that you will sign edm 2073 tabled by ann mckechin , david drew , andrew george , john battle , mark lazarowicz and peter bottomley calling on the government to increase its aid spending on water and sanitation , and to give political and financial support to extending good practice within and amongst public water utilities . i also urge you to raise these concerns with the secretary of state hilary benn . please : 1 . sign edm 2073 promoting public solutions to the global water crisis 2 . write to hilary benn , secretary of state for international development and call on him to politically and financially support public solutions to the global water crisis . i look forward to your response . read more about wdm 's dirty aid dirty water campaign_nnp _ _ rich carlson has been making computer games professionally for five years . he 's worked on megabudget computer games for looking glass studios , ion storm and a few other high profile computer game companies . he recently started creating his own modestly - priced computer games ( along with iikka keranen and bill " phosphorous " sears , under the name digital eel ) for a seattle - based boardgame company called cheapass games . he gave this unedited interview to fairplay . fp : do you agree with fairplay 's belief that games are currently too expensive ? rc : yes i do . as i see it , electronic games are becoming a premium - priced form of entertainment . i have mixed feelings about that . computer games have always been expensive . but i have little respect for games that regurgitate the same gameplay time after time , or are short " one time through " affairs . games like these are not a good deal at $ 50 - $ 65 , regardless of the time and cost involved in making them . you can buy monopoly for what , $ 15 ? maybe less . monopoly will give your family literally decades of replayability . you get far more entertainment than what you paid for , so to speak . current commercially produced computer games are often best described as disposable entertainment . here 's the deal : i can buy two copies of starships unlimited for every copy of max payne ( or ut2003 or whatever ) that i purchase . starships unlimited is an independent game , it costs $ 20 and offers endless replayability . max payne can be played through in 6 - 10 hours , and then you 're done with it . throw it in the wastebasket , or stuff it in the back of your dusty game shelf . game over . goodbye $ 50 . to be fair , max payne has a lot going for it , like a cool main character , neat graphics and special effects , and some good gameplay , but none of this matters when you 're through playing the game . you wo n't even remember it in a year or two .... but you 'll still be playing starships unlimited . replayability = value . many commercial game makers have either forgotten this , or they have chosen to make and sell game types that are not replayable . but it is their choice , and it is their fault . fp : do you believe that making games significantly cheaper would increase sales to such an extent that the industry would generate more revenue and profit overall ? rc : well that 's a tough one because people want to think that " expensive " means quality . marketers know this and price their products accordingly . and publishers want to charge as much for a new game as the market will bear so that they can make as much of a profit as possible . also , it is a matter of perceptions . when we go to eb we see that " cheap games " are shabby games , old games , coasterware and games that did n't sell . so the perception is that cheap means " not as cool as the full - priced stuff . " i do n't think that anyone , or any arguments , will ever give electronic arts ( for example ) reasons enough to cause them to consider lowering the list prices of their latest crop of games . the industry is a big heavy metal machine , and it 's rolling , and it ai n't gon na stop ..... but if prices were lowered industry - wide , would games sell better ? definitely . it would also boost the sales of pc 's and consoles . you can see this type of thing happen when a newly - released game is n't selling very well and the publisher reacts by dropping the price by $ 10 and zoom , off she goes . x the answer , as i see it , is for some entity to come along and create a solid profitable distribution network for independently - produced games ( with a greater variety of genres and price ranges ) . in small ways , this is beginning to happen , but not fast enough and not extensively . as a friend of mine pointed out , movies and the music business have avenues for independent distribution , so why not games ? because publishers are after the fast money . they want multimillion dollar hits . they prefer to risk millions of dollars in this way , and if you examine the financial summaries of a company like ea , you 'll soon learn that these risks are in fact extremely profitable . they do n't deal with indie distribution simply because they do n't need to . fp : do you feel that lower - priced games would mean a better chance of success for quirkier , more innovative products which currently fail - as people would be more likely to take risks at impulse prices ? rc : that 's an interesting question . i 'd only be able to take a stab at the answer and say yes . but it is instinct telling me this and not facts . to play devil 's advocate for a bit , unique , quirky and innovative big budget games do get made , although far fewer than in previous years . most games are copycat titles , but every year a couple shine out above the rest as something really special . so what is going on is this kind of brute - force " throw money at it " scenario which still manages to produce great games , even though it is a wasteful and very " lowest common denominator " process . go figure . ;) but in my opinion , there can and should be more than two or three innovative , unique and unusual titles per year . i 'm spoiled . i started playing games in the late 70 's . i saw the dawn of computer games , and the explosion of creativity that followed for a decade and a half until doom changed everything - a level of creative involvement and intensity unmatched in recent years , no matter what anyone says . fp : but would it actually work out that way ? some developers have said that lower prices would actually stifle creativity . i also was around to experience the board game renaissance in the 80 's . you had incredible board games , war games , fantasy games , rpg 's , games in every genre imaginable , coming out each week ! when i look at the pile of shallow , derivative , " same as it ever was " 3d action games , so - called rts games and d&d rip - offs which fill the computer store shelves these days , i just shake my head , because few know how good it could truly be for computer gamers . 3d , and 3d technology and hardware , are what is driving the computer game industry right now . everyone is trying to beat everyone else with the latest graphics pizzazz . that 's where most of the emphasis is , and that 's where most of the money goes . but an event horizon of sorts will soon occur , when every game will have the same graphic capability , and graphic snazz wo n't be a prime selling point anymore . we 're already seeing this with game architecture , landscaping and level design . getting characters to look great is the next big step ( see doom 3 ) but once that hurdle is exceeded , then it 's back to just making good games again . i 'll tell you that this ca n't come soon enough for me . meanwhile , i have ideas for games that do n't all require a 3d presentation . and i have ideas for 3d games that are n't remotely on the scale of something like morrowind . so i 'm going to pursue these things , and damn the torpedoes . digital eel games will always be cheap to purchase . we can control that right now . and we can make sure , to the very best of our ability , that gamers will get quality , fun , replayability and value for their money . if i work for the big boys , i just do n't feel that i can make that promise . that 's how we 're dealing with this . by ignoring the industry at large in favor of a mellower , less mighty approach to this endlessly fascinating task of making groovy games . fp : and do you think this could potentially provide the industry with a big creative boost as well as a financial one ? rc : it could . and the industry needs that creative boost constantly . how does it survive without it ?_. _ _ freedom of information : this page has been downloaded from the campaign for freedom of information " http://www.cfoi.org.uk/awards94pr.html " the campaign for freedom of information press release embargoed : 6 pm , monday february 27 , 1995 1994 freedom of information awards the contributions towards greater openness made by individuals and organisations are recognised by the campaign for freedom of information 's annual awards , presented in london on the evening of february 27 . the awards are presented by eithne fitzgerald , minister of state in the office of the tanaiste ( deputy prime minister ) in ireland and minister of state for labour affairs . ms fitzgerald is responsible for introducing a freedom of information bill in ireland , due by the end of the year , and for piloting the ethics in public office bill . freedom of information awards go to : kenneth clarke , the chancellor of the exchequer , for publishing the minutes of his monthly meetings with the governor of the bank of england . arthur and victoria mcconnell who fought to improve patient information about drugs after their daughter died after taking steroids . john carvel of the guardian and david gardner of the financial times for effective challenges to the secrecy of the council of ministers , the european union 's most powerful institution . llew smith mp and his research assistant david lowry for their sustained campaign against nuclear secrecy . caithness & sutherland enterprise , a training and development body , for a disclosure policy which rejects " the fig leaf " of commercial confidentiality . omagh people against goldmining for a successful legal challenge to the environmental secrecy of the crown estate . susan o'keeffe , the world in action journalist who faced the threat of imprisonment for protecting her sources . richard norton - taylor of the guardian , for his play dramatising the scott inquiry . the liverpool echo for a successful challenge to an injunction which had prevented them revealing details of an inquiry into a mismanaged council contract . kenneth clarke kenneth clarke , the chancellor of the exchequer , receives an award for publishing the minutes of his monthly meetings with the governor of the bank of england . the campaign 's director , maurice frankel , describes the release of this material , which began in april 1994 , as " a breakthrough which undermines one of whitehall 's deepest taboos . discussions between ministers and their advisers - policy advice - is virtually never released , and the disclosure of such high level discussions is unprecedented . mps are not even allowed to ask for policy advice in parliamentary questions ; civil servants can not reveal it to select committees ; and ministers issue public interest immunity certificates - so called ' gagging orders ' to try and prevent its release in court , as they did during the matrix churchill trial . " the government argues that revealing advice would prevent officials speaking frankly and damage the decision - making process . as a result it is normally only disclosed after 30-years . kenneth clarke 's robust approach rejects this convention . it is designed to reassure the public and the markets that decisions on interest rates are not taken for political advantage and can be justified on what he argues are objective economic grounds . publication of the minutes is expected to help ensure this . the campaign says that at present it is too easy for ministers to argue that something is technically not feasible , when its own experts ' confidential advice shows this is not so . it wants to see kenneth clarke 's example followed by other departments , so the public can see what the government 's medical , scientific , statistical and other expert advisers have concluded . arthur and victoria mcconnell arthur and victoria mcconnell launched a campaign for patients to be given better warnings about the side effects of corticosteroid medicines after their 9 year old daughter died while taking the drug . their daughter , lexie , had been prescribed a corticosteroid to treat an eye infection . mr and mrs mcconnell say the only warning they were given was that a rash might result , although severe side effects are well documented . in fact she reacted with nausea and serious headaches . more significantly , the drug caused serious damage to her immune system , leaving her unprotected against infection . she later contracted and died of chickenpox in an oxford hospital in november 1992 . the subsequent coroner 's inquest explicitly linked her death to the drug . the mcconnells were deeply critical of the secrecy surrounding the drug licensing system , and launched a campaign both to have the cause of her death properly investigated and to improve the warnings given to doctors and patients . their efforts led to an inquiry by the government 's committee on safety of medicines , and by the manufacturer of the drug , glaxo . as a result , fresh warnings were issued to doctors and the manufacturer has added a specific warning about the risks of infection and chickenpox to the patient leaflet supplied with the drug . the campaign says that such a response to the efforts of an ordinary family is extremely rare , and is a testament to their concern for the welfare of other patients and their highly effective campaigning . the anglia and oxford regional health authority has however refused their calls for a public inquiry into their daughter 's death . their offer of a private inquiry was rejected by the mcconnells , and will not now take place . john carvel , guardian and david gardner , financial times john carvel of the guardian and david gardner of the financial times receive awards for their vigorous challenges to the secrecy of the council of ministers . the two journalists were amongst the first users of a new disclosure code applying to the council and european commission which came into force at the beginning of 1994 . the awards to them recognise the importance of journalists treating secrecy as an issue of immediate priority to their own work and not - as so often - merely as a news item to be reported if presented on a press release . john carvel , the guardian 's european affairs editor , applied for and obtained documents of a meeting of the ministers dealing with social affairs issues , at which the uk secured a partial opt - out from a directive on child labour . but he was refused equivalent documents from a meeting of ministers dealing with immigration and terrorism . mr carvel appealed , arguing that the withheld documents had similar status to those that had been released . in response , the council claimed both sets of documents should have been withheld under a controversial exemption protecting the " confidentiality of proceedings " . the child labour material had been disclosed in error , it concluded . the british government , like most other member states , supported this secrecy , but the danish and dutch governments backed the guardian . the paper has challenged the decision at the european court of justice in luxembourg , where it is formally supported by the european parliament and the danish and dutch governments . a hearing is expected later in the year . the award to david gardner recognises his paper 's challenge to the policy of keeping secret voting records at the council of ministers . the council is the forum at which foreign ministers from each member state vote to introduce european law . in 1994 mr gardner , then the ft 's brussels correspondent , used the new code to request records of how each government had voted since 1989 on hundreds of directives . the council 's secretariat refused to release the information , claiming - extraordinarily - that it did not hold records of how members of this crucial legislative body voted . it said the only records were in the minutes of the meetings themselves , which it would not release - again citing the exemption for the " confidentiality of proceedings " . the ft appealed , and was supported by denmark and holland against the majority of member states . in this case the uk government proposed a compromise , which was eventually accepted . under it , past voting records remain confidential , but records of future votes are now being centrally recorded and disclosed . llew smith mp and david lowry the award to llew smith mp ( labour , blaenau gwent ) and david lowry his research assistant recognises their persistent campaign against nuclear secrecy . llew smith , who was elected to the commons in 1992 , is amongst the most tenacious tablers of parliamentary questions ( pqs ) . between may 1992 and october 1994 he tabled more than 2,500 questions , a third of them on nuclear issues . he insists that far from asking too many questions , mps ask too few - and that pqs provide the only reliable opportunity for backbenchers to elicit information . the questions have deliberately probed the extent of the official secrecy surrounding nuclear reprocessing , radiation risks , the use of plutonium , nuclear proliferation , leaks of nuclear material , activities at sellafield and many related issues . a response to one of llew smith 's questions in 1994 provided the first comprehensive figure for the number of occasions on which civil nuclear material had been removed by the british government from the internationally monitored non - proliferation safeguards and transferred to military use . there have been 571 such instances since 1979 , many of them only temporary , but some representing permanent transfers of civil nuclear material for military purposes . mr smith has also highlighted the government 's repeated refusal to answer questions about arms sales to iraq , on the grounds that this was a matter for the scott inquiry . he took the issue up with lord justice scott directly , who declared that he had no objection to ministers answering questions on the matters he was investigating . mr smith was however later barred by the speaker from tabling any further questions on arms to iraq or the scott inquiry , a controversial decision which has further limited the opportunities for holding the government to account on these topics . caithness & sutherland enterprise caithness & sutherland enterprise ( case ) receives an award for a bold disclosure policy based , in its own words , " on a belief that the old fig leaf of ' commercial confidence ' is no longer sustainable . " case is one of 10 local enterprise companies ( lecs ) , which since 1991 have been responsible for training and development grants in the highlands & islands of scotland . lecs , like their english counterparts the training & enterprise councils ( tecs ) have been criticised for their lack of accountability , particularly as most directors are appointed from local businesspeople . in response to such concerns , case introduced a farsighted openness policy . it publishes a monthly report with a full account of who has benefitted , and in what way , from public funds , with specific details of every grant made ranging from training credits of a few pounds to business grants of tens of thousands . elsewhere such details are almost always withheld on commercial or privacy grounds . case says that if the openness policy deters some clients from seeking grants " such risks are worth taking " . it believes its work will be improved by " knowing that we may have to publicly defend what we are doing with the public 's money " . case 's example has now been followed by the other 9 lecs in the highlands and islands region though not by other scottish lecs or by the english tecs . omagh people against goldmining omagh people against goldmining ( opag ) is a small local environmental group which has successfully concluded what is probably the first test case under a new environmental information law . in may 1993 , omagh minerals ltd obtained a lease from the crown estate to extract gold and silver , by a process using cyanide , from land near omagh , in county tyrone , northern ireland . a crucial aspect of the lease requires the company to put up a bond to cover the cost of making good any environmental damage caused by the open cast mining . however , despite repeated questioning during a public inquiry neither the company nor the crown estate were prepared to reveal the size of the bond . residents in the area suspected it might not be sufficient , and applied to the crown estate for a copy of the lease and details of the bond . the application was made under the environmental information regulations 1992 , which implement a european directive intended to guarantee the public 's right to environmental information held by public bodies . however , the crown estate refused to release the information claiming ( though without explaining why ) that they were not subject to the regulations at all , and that the information was in any case commercially confidential . backed by the environmental law group field and solicitors leigh day & co , an opag member challenged this decision by judicial review , in what was the first case of its kind . days before the case was heard in the high court , the crown estate , backed down and handed over the requested information . susan o'keeffe susan o'keeffe is a granada tv journalist who risked imprisonment rather than reveal her sources . her " world in action " programme , broadcast in 1991 , rocked the irish political establishment with allegations of serious financial malpractice in the irish beef industry and alleged ties to leading political figures . the programme led to the establishment of a special judicial tribunal , which after a three year inquiry vindicated most of ms o'keeffe 's allegations . but much of the report 's impact was lost when , perhaps not accidentally , the day set for its debate in the irish parliament proved to coincide with the announcement of the ira ceasefire . ironically , the only person who faced any formal charges was susan o'keeffe herself . she was charged with contempt of court for refusing to name her sources to the tribunal . at one stage the irish authorities considered seeking to have ms o'keeffe , who lives in manchester , extradited from britain . she later returned voluntarily and was charged with contempt . when the case came to court , this january , the state 's case against her collapsed and she was acquitted . despite the possibility of a two - year prison sentence she continued to refuse to name her informants throughout , upholding a vital journalistic principle that protects the flow of information to the public . richard norton - taylor richard norton - taylor receives an award for his dramatisation of the scott inquiry . his play , " half the picture " , reconstructed the inquiry 's highlights verbatim from the transcript of proceedings . the author was one of the few people to sit through all 400 hours of the inquiry 's public proceedings . his play , which was widely praised by drama critics , ran for a month at london 's tricycle theatre in the summer of 1994 , is due to be broadcast on bbc2 shortly , and the bbc is considering translating it into arabic for broadcast on the world service . the play proved an extraordinarily insightful , accessible and entertaining guide to the many complex issues raised by the inquiry and , for those who saw it , some compensation for the fact that this unique investigation into whitehall 's secretive decision - making was not itself televised . richard norton - taylor has been covering whitehall and official secrecy for the guardian since 1975 . his book on the scott inquiry " truth is a difficult concept " was published earlier this month . the liverpool echo the liverpool echo receives an award for successfully challenging an injunction which had barred it from revealing the findings of a draft report into a controversial loss - making council contract . liverpool city council 's direct services organisation had undertaken the contract to lay cable tv cables , despite warnings that it was ill - equipped to do so . in the event , the council made losses of around � 5 million . the council commissioned accountants kpmg peat marwick to investigate . the liverpool echo learnt of the findings of their draft report , but was prevented from publishing by an injunction obtained by kpmg . the firm argued that it would not be in the public interest to allow a draft report , which might not be entirely accurate , to be debated publicly . but the newspaper argued that it was important that local voters should learn about the findings immediately , as local council elections were only a month away . the judge , commenting on the delays in producing the report , held that the overriding public interest favoured disclosure before the election , and lifted the injunction , allowing the paper to reveal the draft report 's findings . newspapers are increasingly subject to legal restraints on publication , which they often find too expensive to challenge . the award to the echo recognises the importance of the paper 's vigorous defence of its right to inform its readers ._. _ _ even out vat payments and smooth your cash flow : the annual accounting scheme do n't pay your vat until your customers pay you : the cash accounting scheme apply an average rate for simpler vat : the flat rate scheme selling to the public made easier : retail schemes account for vat on the margin of second hand goods , works of art , antiques and collectors ' items further help and advice accounting for vat in the standard way can be time -

sized towns and cities in england , like reading or nottingham . these councils also provide all local services , but may cover a wider area , for example bath and north east somerset . in northern ireland , there are local councils , but most services are carried out by other organisations . to find out more about local councils in northern ireland , visit the northern ireland local government association website . if you live in a rural or semi - rural part of england , local government is split between a county council and a district council . county councils cover large areas , like devon or kent , and provide about 80 per cent of services for that area . district councils cover smaller areas and provide more locally based services . see the table below for a list of what each type of council does . county council district council education services electoral registration libraries environmental health social services council housing streets and roads leisure and recreation facilities local transport local planning waste disposal waste collection in england , some towns and london boroughs also have their own directly elected mayor . there are mayors in : bedford , doncaster , hackney , hartlepool , lewisham , mansfield , middlesborough , newham , north tyneside , stoke on trent and watford . as well as local councils , the uk also has around 10,000 parish , town and community councils . these form the most local level of local government . parish councils in england and community councils in scotland and wales are responsible for things like : allotments , bus shelters , car parks , public toilets , cemeteries , footpath lighting , litter bins , local halls and community centres , parks and public ponds , public clocks and war memorials . you can find out if you live in an area with a parish , town or community council in england and wales from the website of the national association of local councils . in scotland , information is available from the association of scottish community councils website . how are they elected ? when you vote in a local election , you will receive a ballot paper listing all the candidates standing to be a councillor in your area . you may be asked to vote for more than one candidate depending on where you live . you can vote in person at a polling station or apply to vote by post or proxy . when are they elected ? each councillor is elected for four years , but when you have an opportunity to elect them depends on the type of council you have in your area and what voting method it uses . if your council votes by thirds , this means that a third of councillors are elected every year over a three year cycle . if your council elects by halves , half of councillors are elected every two years . other local authorities , such as the london boroughs , elect all of their councillors every four years . whatever method your local authority uses , you will be able to vote in local elections once every four years . to find out if there is a local election coming up in your area , go to the elections page_nn _ _ help finding your way round our website what information is on the site ? page structure navigating pds website printing pages text only version downloads making comments about our website if you want to find out how to change your computer settings , please visit our accessibility page . for terms and conditions of use and a statement of our privacy policy , please see the website policy section . help finding your way round our website there are several ways of finding out what is on the site and of going to the page you require . go to the site map to see what topics we cover . start at the home page and browse through the site by clicking on the left -

" the beacon award itself is valued by local authorities , as it is a recognition by peers and collegues of outstanding practice . for some this is about innovation , and for others , it is getting all the elements right to produce an oustanding outcome . for all those bidding to become a beacon , there is also a willingness to share their experiences and approaches with others at events such as this . " the three beacon councils in this category are quite different from each other , both in terms of the population and character of their area , but also in terms of the approaches they have adopted . i was very impressed by the work of these three councils , and believe the opportunity to learn with them is an important one not to be missed .

( this means that if two nested handlers exist for the same exception , and the exception occurs in the try clause of the inner handler , the outer handler will not handle the exception . ) before an except clause 's suite is executed , details about the exception are assigned to three variables in the sys module : sys.exc receives the object identifying the exception ; sys.exc receives the exception 's parameter ; sys.exc receives a traceback object ( see section 3.2 ) identifying the point in the program where the exception occurred . these details are also available through the sys.exc ( ) function , which returns a tuple ( exc , exc , exc ) . use of the corresponding variables is deprecated in favor of this function , since their use is unsafe in a threaded program . as of python 1.5 , the variables are restored to their previous values ( before the call ) when returning from a function that handled an exception . the optional else clause is executed when no exception occurs in the try clause . exceptions in the else clause are not handled by the preceding except clauses . the try ... finally form specifies a ` cleanup ' handler . the try clause is executed . when no exception occurs , the finally clause is executed . when an exception occurs in the try clause , the exception is temporarily saved , the finally clause is executed , and then the saved exception is re - raised . if the finally clause raises another exception or executes a return , break or continue statement , the saved exception is lost . the exception information is not available to the program during execution of the finally clause . when a return or break statement is executed in the try suite of a try ... finally statement , the finally clause is also executed ` on the way out . ' a continue statement is illegal in the try clause . ( the reason is a problem with the current implementation -- this restriction may be lifted in the future ) ._. _ _ listen to the lord british journalism review vol . 17 , no . 2 , 2006 , pages 3 - 5 contents - vol 17 , no 2 , 2006 editorial - listen to the lord 3 bill hagerty - kinnock : where clarke was right 7 close - up on the bbc will wyatt - stand up and be counted 15 michael white - grumpy humpy should bow out 21 tim luckhurst - sabotaging a star 27 francis jezierski - unequal war of the web 33 jane brown - fast stalker 39 roger bolton - mind your language 44 british museum - gone and ( largely ) forgotten 50 stephen bax - beware the press in times of war 53 john campbell - why papers of record are history 59 stewart purvis - clean sweep in the ukraine 65 book reviews anthony delano on dennis griffiths 70 martyn gregory on patricia holland 72 michael leapman on angela v john 74 liz vercoe on julia hobsbawm 76 martin rowson on mark bryant 78 the way we were 32 buried in the debris after the storm that re - arranged the cabinet and drove charles clarke on to the back benches was a speech he made about the media while he was still home secretary . although not ignored , as we recall below , it was lost to sight as clarke struggled to escape from the problem of the convicted criminals who might have been deported if they could have been found , and as tony blair manoeuvred to protect his government . but the speech needs to be unearthed and examined , because the ideas behind it are not going to disappear ; in fact , some have already been echoed by lord kinnock in an interview after clarke 's departure , which the bjr publishes in this issue . mr clarke 's speech � or , rather , lecture � was given as part of polis , a new joint - programme of events , teaching and research mounted by the london school of economics and the london college of communication . among other things , polis intends to make � specific policy interventions � on � the changing role of news media and the challenges that they face � . at the lse on the april 24 one of mr clarke 's key passages was : � i believe that a pernicious and even dangerous poison is now slipping into at least some parts of this media view of the world . in the absence of many of the genuinely dangerous and evil totalitarian dictatorships to fight � since they 've gone � the media have steadily , rhetorically transferred to some of the existing democracies , particularly the united states and the united kingdom , some of the characteristics of those dictatorships . � in his column in the guardian , simon jenkins � no leftist , as he pointed out himself � was quick to pick up the gauntlet . he countered with quotations of hyperbolic speeches by tony blair and declared : � no , this is not a totalitarian government but it is a � creeping authoritarian ' one . nor is the press peddling � a pernicious and dangerous poison ' in protesting . it is doing its job . � press gazette detected a desire for state regulation of the press , and surmised that other members of the cabinet would concur with mr clarke 's personal view as expressed in the lecture . although mr clarke 's targets were in the liberal press � specifically , articles in the guardian , observer and the independent � the daily telegraph joined in the attacks on him in an editorial declaring that he � was once a fanatical student radical who enjoyed his visits to the soviet union and , clearly , learnt a lot from them . equally clearly , he pines after a policy where the executive does what it likes and the media does what it is told � . mr clarke 's speech was based , naturally enough , on his duties as home secretary . he headed � only for another 11 days , as it turned out � a department of state the very name of which epitomises old - fashioned , 18thcentury whitehall spin . home office : the words conjure up a cozy image of twinkly - eyed dickensian uncles handing out bicycles to village bobbies . disappointing to realise , then , that its functions are the same or similar to those of that stern foreign institution , the ministry of the interior , a name full of orwellian foreboding . but whatever its name , it was the home office that created the trap into which mr clarke fell and blundered about , arguing about the meaning of the word � responsibility � , until he impaled himself on the stake of required resignation . he could hardly blame the media for his loss of office . only the most dedicated political anoraks among the nation 's readers , viewers and listeners can have been aware of the scale of the mess over prisoners and deportations before ( the day after the lecture ) mr clarke admitted in a written statement to the public accounts committee that 1,023 foreign prisoners � murderers , rapists and child sex - attackers among them � had been let out but not deported . he was certainly pursued by the media after that date : before then his nemesis was the conservative mp for south norfolk , richard bacon . ( perhaps our trade or profession deserve a very small pat on the back on the grounds that mr bacon used to be one of us . his biography , as posted on his website , says he once worked in financial journalism . ) the echoes of mr clarke 's strictures come from lord kinnock , chair of the british council . they are not couched in mr clarke 's excitable language and they are not circumscribed by a departmental responsibility but range over a broad field , as you can read in detail in this issue of the bjr . lord kinnock , who , before he became leader of the opposition , brought mr clarke into westminster � first as a researcher and then as his chief - of - staff � perceives a lack of distinction between news and comment in present - day reporting . it could be argued that politicians never complain about that sort of distortion when it favours their own case , but lord kinnock 's concerns have a bearing on the loss of trust in the media among the public , and how that can be repaired without recourse to statutory control . in practical terms , lord kinnock has concrete proposals for rescuing and reviving the press complaints commission , which is in danger of becoming moribund because of the predominance of serving editors and editors ' representatives wedged under the chairmanship of sir christopher meyer , whose authority and suitability for the role were questioned by many after the publication of his dc confidential volume of up - market tittle - tattle . ( the pcc 's rapid rejection of a request to reopen its inquiry into the daily mirror 's city slickers insider share - dealing affair has also raised eyebrows . expressing � regret � that it had been misled by trinity mirror over the amount of shares bought by then editor piers morgan displayed all the bite of a toothless poodle . ) lord kinnock urges a new constitution for the pcc and the chairmanship of a respected figure from the judiciary , rather than what can be perceived as the out - to - grass appointment of a retired civil servant or government minister . his ideas deserve careful consideration and debate by the media community . the unwelcome alternative could be a strict legal framework to put the press under control � the kind of control that would suit a ministry of the interior . the british journalism review is published quarterly and is available by subscription . published by sage publications , subscription@sagepub.co.uk , issn 0956 - 4748 tel . + 44 ( 0)20 7324 8500 , fax . + 44 ( 0)20 7324 8600 , website http://www.sagepub.co.uk site designed and maintained by chris thompson , waverley internet design � 1999 - 2006 bjr publishing ltd._nnp _ _ graduation day ... 54 years late ! graduation day at durham university will be a double celebration for one family , as a daughter collects her mba ( master of business administration ) and her father formally graduates - 54 years after he completed his degree .

" following a speech at a recent call centre conference i heard three different suppliers say , " it is five times more expensive to recruit a new customer as to retain an existing one . " however when quizzed on how the call centre could help to improve customer retention , the answer was little more than providing better customer service or buying a software suite . senior management knows that the call centre has a role to play in customer retention , but has no direct experience in how to put it into practice . the link is not obvious and relies on changing the view of customer service into one of customer relationships . it also requires a whole new way of thinking towards the customer . customer lifetime value to get to the heart of customer retention it is necessary to adopt a lifetime view of the customer . this involves looking at the customer over their complete life - from birth to death - as this is ultimate customer retention . the needs of the customer will change as their circumstances change from leaving school , first job , getting married , buying a house , having children and retiring . the service that you provide needs to map to the different lifestyle phases of the customer . the customer will also react differently depending upon their history with your organisation . these could be characterised as prospective customer , new customer , mature customer and churning customer . again , the call centre needs to tailor service for these different phases . some organisations are also looking at the lifetime value of their customers . customer lifetime value is an estimate of the likely long - term profit that you could derive from a customer over their complete lifetime . for example , a student may have a low current value to a bank , but their long - term value could be very significant . lifetime value is a predicted value derived from the total spend to date , cost of service to date , expected lifetime within the organisation and probability of churn . the link between marketing and the call centre " all men are created equal " drafted jefferson in the american declaration of independence - and in a large number of call centres , this is held to be the guiding principle . all customers are dealt with strict rotation - the longest waiting principle - irrespective of their value to the organisation . " why should i treat callers differently ? " i am frequently asked . in most service - related businesses , segmentation by value is employed . the restaurant owner will always find a table in a full restaurant for their regular customers and airlines have adopted frequent flyer programs tiered into different levels - but many companies do not use customer segmentation in the call centre . within these companies , sophisticated customer profiling and customer segmentation information will be used . but these are typically retained in the marketing department , which uses these to develop new products , special offers and to produce direct mail . however , in almost all companies they are not linked into the call centre . the key to customer retention in the call centre is to be able to deal with different customers in different ways based on their lifecycle stage and customer value . in essence the call centre has to transform into a relationship centre . quick wins to build a relationship centre will probably require a substantial level of investment . however , there have been a number of " quick wins " that some companies have used to help support customer retention . review customer defection points . identify the discernible customer churn points , where a telephone call can help ? you could either use an outbound call or perhaps tail end an existing incoming call . an organisation that has adopted a link between the call centre and customer retention is the mobile phone company , orange . they have analysed the customer lifetime and have identified two very distinct churn points . at both of these points the customer is highly likely to churn . the churn points are at the end of the 14-day money back guarantee and at the nine - month break point in the contract . just before both of these life points , an outbound call is made to ask if they had any problems , needed advice on the service or to suggest moving on to a more appropriate tariff plan . problems can then be nipped in the bud and dealt with in a more proactive basis . these actions have directly helped in reducing their overall churn rate . review the telephone numbers strategy used for existing and new customers . it is important to be able to differentiate between prospective and existing customers . existing customers are intrinsically more valuable than prospective customers . " a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush " is as relevant to a call centre operation as to the world at large . so , where are companies going wrong ? a well - known insurance company has spent a lot of money in an expensive tv campaign to recruit new customers . it needed an 0800 number to support the campaign and provide on line quotes . however , for existing customers to renew their insurance , the company provided an 0990 number . the customers were charged for a long distance call and were also given a lower priority in the queue than the tv response line . while this would have all been done for the right business reasons it can have a damaging effect on customer loyalty . in essence , this is making it easier for customers to obtain a quote from a competitor rather than extending their existing policy . the saving grace was that a tv advertising campaign also strengthened the existing customer 's view of the company , which lead to more renewals . view the call as more than a transaction . the focus on efficiency and transactions has sometimes lead to the belief that the best call is a short call . a technique adopted by liverpool victoria group is to engage the customer in conversation . if a caller is looking for a " green card " for a foreign visit in their car , ask if they are going on holiday . it just helps to improve the overall perception to the customer . make the customer feel special . first direct end every call with " ... is there anything else that i can help you with today ? " in his book " excelling in the 1990 's : ceo perspectives " , r. p. cooley identifies that the major reason that customers leave is ' because they have encountered an attitude of indifference as they are being served . ' this applies to 68 % of customer defectors , compared to the 14 % who leave because they are dissatisfied with products and services . examine initiatives that could make the customer feel special . review your voice prompts . one of the biggest ways to upset the caller is by poor and inappropriate use of interactive voice response systems . poor menu structure and not being able to connect to an agent are the most frustrating problems for the customer . the menu structure should be simple - not more than four options and no more than two levels . why not adapt the ivr menu structure to the caller 's profile ? for example if the caller does not have a savings account , do not give this as an option on the menu for this caller . it may be more complex to develop , but can help reduce the overall frustrations of having to talk to a computer . make certain that you can transfer calls . avoid the trap of " we do n't deal with that here - please ring this number " . transfer the call - even if it is to one of your suppliers or partners . if an agent can not deal with a call , make sure that you can transfer the caller to the area where their query can be dealt with . this may have cost implications , but " one call does it all " is a very sensible strategy . agent workshops . workshop sessions can be held with the call centre agents to ensure that they can understand the benefits of the customer lifetime approach . every agent can relate a tale of bad service and can identify areas where different techniques can be used . by using workshop techniques , it is possible to pool the overall experience of the group to help develop customer relationships . relationship centre ultimately the best way to support customer relationships in the call centre is to build a relationship centre . this is a combination of a new technical architecture , customer segmentation , new call handling processes and agent empowerment . the relationship will be able to support customer retention and customer relationships . the technical architecture will be built upon relationship routing and data access . the technology allows the call centre to route calls based on lifetime value or customer lifecycle . the high value client could be routed to a " relationship manager " and the low value client will be encouraged to use self - service technologies . alternatively the caller could be routed to an agent with a similar lifestyle who may have more empathy with their needs . one of the most difficult elements to pull together is the customer information , which is typically buried in a number of unrelated databases . it requires data mining techniques or the adoption of a real time customer information server that holds the customer 's information . this is then fed into a relationship router that can route the call to the most appropriate engine ( human or computer ) . the technology involved in creating a relationship centre is not available from any one vendor and involves a combination of a number of technologies . these include telephony platform , voice response , computer telephony , relationship routing , agent desktop software , customer service software and data retrieval . companies are increasingly looking towards specialist external consultants with skills in customer relationship management , call centres and systems integration to pull it all together . to be able to deploy this at minimum risk " rapid application development " techniques are often deployed to be able to roll out the product in a controlled environment with 6 to 12 week rolling release cycles . summary to really be able to support customer relationship and customer retention strategies in the call centre requires investment to create a relationship centre . it requires both a lifetime view of the customer and a new technical architecture . the benefits of this investment are dramatic and can significantly increase the value to the shareholders and the organisation . there are a number of quick wins that can be applied in the call centre , which could help to improve customer relationships in the short . many organisations have found using external consultants useful in helping to clarify the vision , create the business case and deploy the technology in the shortest timeframe . the most important factor in all of this transformation is always to see it from the customer 's point of view ._. _ _ married to samantha , three surviving grown -

which seems to be on no major party 's agenda - the solution has to revolve around how we organise our working lives . and the first step is recognising that the answer is " no , it does n't have to be like that " - if employers and employees are willing to be flexible . and the benefits can be felt in 3 areas : employees can reduce stress , and become more productive and motivated , and happier , as they achieve a better work - life balance companies can boost staff morale , and introduce practices which are more efficient and effective socially excluded groups who of necessity have to prioritise home life ( e.g. because of caring responsibilities ) may gain access to employment opportunities with companies which allow a better balance . follow on to our flexibility checklist for an outline of work practices to help achieve a better balance ._. _ _ fragmented identities among postcolonial fijians : extending the hand of kinship and respecting the right to choose lucy de bruce is from the kailoma community of fiji . kailomas are the descendants of indigenous fijians and european settlers who became the first ' blended people ' of the fiji islands during the early nineteenth century . they are also known as vasu . over the years the category has grown to include other blood mixtures , although the emphasis is always in relation to one 's fijian ancestry . both lucy 's parents are first generation interracials , while she is a first generation of the two mulattoes . she has close relatives , both native and interracial , throughout fiji . lucy currently resides in sydney , australia , where she is completing a doctorate degree on the mixed - race identity in fiji . she travels regularly to her homeland and is interested in researching kailoma social history as she believes that very little is known about her people . she feels that much information on fiji is centred on its two rival ethnic groups : native fijian landowners and ethnic indians � descendants of indentured labourers brought to work the sugar cane plantations in the late nineteenth century . lucy believes that a factor much overlooked in regards to fiji 's recent civilian coup , led by george speight , was the fijian coup leader 's own racial identity and his claim to represent ' indigenous fijians ' . while she does not dispute speight 's claim to this identity , she offers a closer look at fijians of similar backgrounds to see how they fit into fiji 's race - conscious society . in thinking about the coup she ponders the question of the fijian identity and its relationship to equitable citizenship . the following excerpt is from a submission she prepared recently for delivery , by her brother william , to fiji 's constitutional review commission on the topic of fijian unity . she admits that the mixed - race identity is complex and diverse and that some kailomas may not agree with her . however , she is firmly of the belief that the effects of colonisation on fiji 's interracial community and their diverse � histories � should be brought to a wider audience to take their place alongside ' monoracial ' histories that have long enjoyed popular readership concerning the fiji islands . to the hearing committee on fijian unity a position paper submitted on behalf of the vasu / kailoma interest group of fiji it is with respect and a deep concern that we bring to your attention a matter concerning issues of identity , race categorisation , and ' a sense of belonging ' , as experienced by many members of our small community . we , the vasu / kailoma , as some of you will know , are the descendants of indigenous fijians and other races . in the days before and after colonisation our community was commonly known as ' halfcastes ' or ' part european ' . other labels proposed on our behalf were ' pmend ' ( people of mixed european and native descent ' , ' euronesian ' , and ' anglo - fijian ' ) . many people of racially - mixed descent also identify with the label ' part european ' . following independence , ' part europeans and other groups who were not from the three major racial groupings ( fijian , indian , rotuman ) , were lumped together as general voters under the banner of ' others ' . this category is fraught with complexities and cultural - diversity as to render its usefulness negligible . this submission therefore , is made on behalf of those mixed - race individuals and their families who are descendants of indigenous fijians and who share fijian aspirations and a preference for the fijian identity . regardless of these labels , many of us still relate to the fijian term , ' kailoma ' , to describe ' part europeans ' of fijian heritage . the word means � intermediate place � , and many of us feel it accurately sums up our anomalous place in fijian society and is devoid of racial overtones . on the local scene , we , the kailoma / vasu are known to be the descendants of early european settlers and fijian women . however , as mentioned above , other ' mixed ' people with fijian blood also identify with the kailoma / vasu label . under the colonial system the kailoma interracial identity proved problematic for imperial administrators . their caste - conscious classificatory system followed a divide - and - rule policy which was designed to maintain social control and keep group interaction to a minimum . invariably , the kailoma child proved a disruptive challenge to the colonial system . kailoma 's hybrid identity highlighted the contestations and hypocrisies associated with empire building . it exposed issues of concubinage and miscengenation ( forbidden sex ) between coloniser and subjugated natives and was deemed an unspeakable act by whites . the early products of such liaisons were strongly condemned and ostracised by europeans . fijians , on the other hand , were more sympathetic towards their half - siblings . they called them ' vasu ' ( kin ) and the vasu was extended full membership of one 's mother 's clan . nevertheless under colonial rule , the vasu / kailoma was viewed with suspicion and perceived as a threat to native policy . imperial administrators , informed by eurocentric theories of ' savage races ' , felt the kailoma needed to be watched . the colonial record is filled with references denigrating the kailoma character ( ' the degenerate halfcaste ' , ' the debased halfcaste ' , ' ' the lazy / untrustworthy halfcaste ' , the ' dull - witted halfcaste ' , etc . ) . clearly we were not the ' noble savages ' of the european imagination . the colonial solution to the ' halfcaste problem ' was our permanent relegation to the social fringes of fijian society under the dubious banner of ' part - europeans ' . this way the vasu / kailoma could be monitored and officially ' spoken for ' by our european superiors . they even condescended to give us � part - of � their identity , hence the dog tag ' part - european ' . such was the machinery of the colonial system which so effectively carved up entire fijian clans , regardless of kinship systems or routine social interactions . the vasu / kailoma became the innocent victims of a colonial social engineering project . under british rule , racial categories were standardised and incorporated into official policy . yet before british annexation we were simply fijian , regardless of our bloodmixtures . indeed , many of fiji 's early kai loma were the children of european traders and fijian women who were routinely absorbed into fijian society . many were the children of chiefly women whose menfolk had offered them to european men in exchange for european goods and weapons . it stands to reason , therefore , that there is no such thing as a ' pure fijian race ' since many fijians , particularly those of high rank , have kailoma / european blood flowing in their veins ( ! ) . vasu / kailoma history is tightly woven with fijian history . but such was the legacy of our early european history and the ensuing colonial period that had sought to control natives according to anglocentric ideals based on notions of european supremacy . criteria such as skin colour , class background , and social standing were all part of the colonial yardstick for measuring ' native ' and ' non - native ' . it was the most insidious form of racism with far reaching effects - the psychological scars are still with us today . yet fiji was not alone in this regard . under colonial rule , numerous indigenous communities across the world were divided - up and categorised differently in relation to their natural families . it happened with aborigines , maori , anglo - indians , american indians , eurasians , durban coloureds , caribbean coloureds , south american and philippino mestizos , and many more . closer to home it happened in western samoa . an interesting difference , however , is that following independence in 1962 western samoa absorbed most of its ' part - europeans ' and re - classified those with samoan blood as ' samoan ' . many countries have followed suit , notably maori and aborigines whose former ' part - siblings ' are now routinely absorbed into the indigenous fold following the wave of indigenous revivalism and the prospect of more votes for maori / aboriginal leaders . none of these initiatives have transpired without growing pains . nonetheless they are a testimony to the maturing of a nation and the capacity of indigenous people to grow in self - awareness . in light of these circumstances , it can not be underestimated how dangerous the implications are for fijians to continue in the vein of a divided people . the turbulent times we have witnessed in this last coup should urgently signal that fijians need to do some serious soul searching in relation to the fijian identity and to issues of group belonging among its forgotten and alienated members . we need to look closer at the legal definition of what is meant by ' a fijian ' - where the lines have increasingly blurred between landless fijiians , urban fijians and kailoma fijians . we need to consider comparative international precedents for absorbing interracial subjects back into indigenous systems . this might call for a twin system that distinguishes between the lifestyles of ' traditional ' and ' non - traditional ' fijians . if fiji is to continue as a democracy , then an unambiguous legal framework for defining ' fijian ' is long overdue . the contemporary kailoma identity needs to be ' re - sketched ' in the popular imagination . we , the vasu / kailoma have been here in fiji from the earliest of contact days . we have a distinguished military record and have served our country faithfully alongside our fijian brothers . we were there in the solomons during world war two ; in korea ; northern ireland ; the falklands ; in crack commando units of the british army ; and in united nations peacekeeping forces . indeed , every place that fijian soldiers have served , we have served . we have earned our stripes . today the kailoma identity is fragmented and in deep crisis . since independence our community has suffered from an inferiority complex due , in large part , to its marginal identity and its anomalous race category . for too long we have sat on the sidelines as passive onlookers witnessing much of the political and economic activity that bypasses our participation and contribution . we lack confidence and have internalised much suffering and pain that comes from being a member of an invisible group . we hope that this overview will provide this hearing committee with an opportunity to reflect on the kailoma situation in fiji today . what 's more , we hope that you will consider the notion that � race is a socially constructed phenomenon � and that the racial category we occupy ignores the daily interactions and social relationships that actually exist between kailoma and our fijian relatives . it is our hope that the office of the vasu can assist with our dilemma , and that the ' hand of kinship ' can be extended to members of our community who choose to re - classify as ' itaukei ' ( indigenous ) and vote with our fijian relatives ._. _ _ dear friends , i am hoping that some one out there will have some suggestions for me . i need to work . i retired due to my physical condition . i can no longer walk on my own and suffer from chronic pain etc . i could , however , do work at home as my brain is fine . i am afraid of getting involved with these on line companies who want you to invest a certain amount of $ in order to work at home . does any one know of a reputile contact or do you have some suggestions for me ? i would be grateful for your help many thanks carole replies di 04/07/2005 i would love to do something like that in theuk but ca n't find anything . what i do do , as a volunteer , is support parents of children with special needs over the telephone and by email . i also support and advise parents of gifted children who are having school problems . i don;t get paid but it 's very rewarding work . maybe your voluteer bureau would know of something you could do from home . carole t usa 05/07/2005 email : caroletouz@optonline.net thanks di , your advice is helpful . my work was with the disabled and included advising parents as well as planning and implementing programs . i do have knowledge of the systems here in the nyc area so prehaps i can be of some help . of course i would also like to do some thing for money but your ideas would at least get my brain functioning again . many thanks carole sarah ( uk ) 06/07/2005 hello carol and di , it is a tricky one is nt it . i m also out of work and want to be doing something productive from home , but it all seems to be telesales which i am reluctant to get involved with using my own phone line . have you thought of something like proof reading ? i keep seeing it advertised but do nt know what exactly is available . take care , sarah di 06/07/2005 that 's what i 'd love to do for our local newspaper . they have so many freadful spelling and grammar errors it drives me crazy lol . my typing 's lousy but my spelling is excellent . however , i do n't know the correct symbols for proof marking . i think you would have to train for it . there are jobs like sewing which can be done at home . a neighbour used to finish off shirts for a company but the pay was terrible . when i was a child , my parents and i hand painted toy soldiers for a local company . what a shame everything like that is so automated now . you 've got me thinking about contacting the job centre now to see if they know of anything . does anyone know the regulations about how many hours you may work if you are receiving incapacity benefit ? i could n't cope with many anyway . jan at painsupport 07/07/2005 be very careful about ads in the paper about ' home work ' -
