hands and feet ! do you want to carry on ? � mr c. - � i 'll turn around if you like . � sam - � would you normally carry on in this ? � mr c. - � i 'd have a look and see what it is like , it is n't going to rain . � the reason for the discussion was that the 3 foot square passage became much smaller and steeper so the water flowed even faster ! this makes the passage rather more intimidating . the pair continued a short distance further until a block in the streamway had to be squeezed over . then sam saw how the water was backing up behind mr. c. and a halt was called . sam - � is this really a good idea ? � mr c. - � we could go a little further just to see what happens . � so the pair continued until the passage is eventually relieved slightly by a low canal section where the beautiful white foam provides a more pleasant atmosphere compared to the bare polished rock walls of the fast flowing streamway that you have just emerged from . hoots of joy from mr. c. indicated an improvement and relief passage was reached . here one can stand out of the water and complain about not being able to feel any of your limbs . from relief junction the trip to false fourways and true fourways ensued with only a short distance between these two . fourways north was followed to the start of tunnel passage and the oxbows that lead into this . after only a short distance a sump is encountered that has no way around it . then a return was made along the passage to fourways south and a slippery , thrutchy climb up into sand cavern . here a climb at the eastern end of the chamber leads past a boulder and into a continuing passage with a low roof . then a flat out crawl off to the left leads to a wriggle over boulders which doubles back round to the right in the imperial way . after a short distance this reaches a junction where left leads to a t - junction and left again is a low muddy crawl to a large muddy chamber . below this chamber is the end of tunnel passage and the beginning of tunnel caves . a slope down to the right enters tunnel caves and about 50 m downstream is a junction . to the left is choked with mud and to the right is a sump barring the way into the further reaches of tunnel caves . the heavily silted floor and the sumps show the effects of gripping on the moorlands above . survey cross sections indicate the passage used to be 6 - 12 feet high . now it 's no more than 3 - 4 feet in height - a roomy hands and knees crawl . with tunnel caves finished an exit was started . a rift at the opposite end of sand cavern was examined as a possible alternative route back to false fourways but it proved too tight just within arms reach of the larger passage . mr c. examined a large confusing high level bedding chamber extension to sand cavern . he found a deep vertical rift which dropped into false fourways but since sam was sat on a rock in sand cavern having not followed mr. c. , he had to return . then rapid progress was made back to true fourways where some food was eaten and water drunk before kneewrecker crawl was tackled against the flow of water . mr. c. went first dragging the tackle sack that kept filling with water and acting like a large anchor whilst occasionally sam was able to push the bag into mr. c. 's feet to encourage him forward and ease the struggle . then the boulder that had caused a little concern on the way in was met and mr. c. enquired of sam whether there was an enlargement of the passage close by as he intended to drag the block downstream so as to be able to squeeze past it . this was n't possible and with the application of some weight the damn thing tilted slightly and made itself passable . from here the rest seemed much easier and the entrance series was quickly reached . by sam allshorn trip members mike cooper and sam posted monday , 6 february 2006 last updated wednesday , 1 march 2006 copyright � sam allshorn , 2006 . the copyright for this article remains with the author . it should not be reproduced without permission ._. _ _ beyond language : exploring the potential of multi - modal research a draft discussion paper presented at ifip conferencemanchester , july 2002 by keri facer , head of learning research , futurelab these photographs show all the boys ' family members using the computer ( at different times and , looking at the screens , for different purposes ) , the boys ' bedroom , the countryside outside their house and their dog . talking to the boys about their out of school activities , the daily job of taking their dog for a walk played a major role in their lives , similarly , as a close - knit family in the middle of the countryside , their relationships with other family members were very important . and , as we shall discuss later , the whole family 's familiarity with and regular use of the computer played an important role in their busy lives . their wide ranging interests are also clearly represented in these photographs of the boys ' bedroom , from games to drama , to collecting star wars figures . these processes of selection of ' photo - opportunities ' , even within the constraints established in the guidelines to the children , serves in the same way as children 's selection of particular representation forms in drawing , to provide some preliminary indication of secondary artifacts the children draw upon in communicating their relationships with technology . and yet , in and of themselves these photographs also act as windows , albeit constructed by the children , onto the locations and spatial organisation of technology in their homes , a window that highlights differences and similarities in how families construct the meaning of this technology in domestic space . alongside some computers , for example , we can see potted plants , family photographs , books and writing materials . in other houses we see the computer surrounded by cuddly toys . we can see the presence or absence of games play peripherals alongside the computer . we can compare the different locations and resources that surround the technologies in different homes and can compare the types of people we see using these computers in the different families - parents , siblings , the case study children , friends . we can begin to develop a series of oppositions in terms of the objectification of the computer within the home : play / work ; displayed / hidden ; public / private ; appropriated / sacrosanct . we can see how households have decided , in other words , to represent their computer as part of different social practices within the household . the status of this data , then , is ambiguous but rich - the process of taking the photographs , selecting images and shots in and of itself functions as a communicative mechanism between researcher and researched in a way that transcends and problematises the simple definition of children as ' participant researchers ' participating in an objective research process . and in and of themselves , the photographs provide a rich source of visual data , of particular interest to the socio - cultural researcher , about the types and range of resources that live alongside technologies both in the children 's lives and in the lived spaces of the home . exploring three dimensions the last multi - modal process i would like to discuss as part of the screen play project was not so much an overt technique as a focusing of attention by the researchers on an alternative mode of meaning - making within the home . it is also the process that both arguably gave most to the research and has been least acknowledged in our analyses of the project . namely , the process of using our own eyes to observe the visual during the research process . in writing methodological accounts of the project we have gone into some detail about our use of interviews and the questionnaire survey . in contrast , what we have never before foregrounded was how seeing the home environment informed the development of theory . rather , because we are bound by notions of data as ' stuff ' - photographs , questionnaires , documents , transcripts - we tend to undervalue the importance of what we see . reading recent reviews of the field of visual sociology , however , we would want to begin to argue that this process has been central to this research , and agree with emmison and smith ( 2001 ) that : simply availing oneself of the information which is readily available to the eye is , we suggest , the logical starting point for a methodologically robust visual social science rather than the prevailing assumption that this must be founded on the technology of the camera . ( emmison & smith , 2001 , p10 ) ... or , we could argue , the interview or the questionnaire . shifting away from the two - dimensional representations of reality afforded by photographs and drawings , the process of visiting and mapping the home environments in which children were using computers afforded the potential to map a three - dimensional reality . this included identifying the locations of computers around the home , the observed and inferred movements of people around that space and the ways in which these different spaces afforded different constructions of the home computer . for example , the process of mapping the layout of the twins ' home ( nick and james , discussed earlier ) , identified that the computer on the landing , which might have been thought to be an ' out of the way ' space , was approximately at the heart of the family home and consequently a site for regular traffic by parents and siblings alike ( fig 1 ) . fig . 1 the stairs leading down from the landing were , evidently , the main route for traffic between the different floors , and the landing ( a small space , approx 2 x 2 m ) was the focal point for all upstairs activity as all three bedrooms and the only bathroom opened onto this . in addition , as the two boys in the household shared a bedroom , this landing had been co - opted as an extension of this space . similarly , looking at the downstairs layout of the home , in order to get from the living room to the kitchen , a family member would have to pass the foot of the stairs , easily affording conversation with and a view of anyone using the computer on the landing . moreover , the stairs gave on to the front door so that anyone returning home would immediately see anyone using the computer . the stairs themselves were a regular site for congregation , both prior to going out , and to pet the family 's cat and dog , who tended to sit there on a regular basis ._. _ _ subscription and back issue details back issues of numbers 2 and 3 are available at � 2:50 each , plus 75p postage for one magazine . issues 4 and 8 are � 3:00 each , plus 75p postage for one magazine . issue 10 , 11 and 12 are � 3:50 , plus 75p postage for one magazine . postage for multiply issues is : � 1:25 for two magazines , � 2:00 for three magazines , � 3:10 for four issues , � 3:45 for five issues and � 4:40 for six issues . subscribe to action tv for four issues now for only � 13 , including postage ( uk only ) . for orders outside the uk please add � 2:50 per magazine to cover airmail postage -

september 1998 table of contents david mcgregor retires dmitry storchak promoted to senior seismologist new seismologist hired distinguished visitors new on the web site more work stations installed reorganisation of data management begins isc papers at the esc noted with regret david mcgregor retires deputy director david mcgregor retired in august after 34 years with the isc . david joined the isc as its first employee when it was located at its original site in oswald road , edinburgh , and continued with the centre at its subsequent homes in edinburgh , newbury , and thatcham . together with former director anthony hughes he was one of the four people who moved with the isc when it relocated to southern england . educated as a geologist , david began his service with the isc developing computer programs , back when programmers carefully guarded cabinets filled with precious punched cards . as time went on , he transferred a growing library of programs from cards to tapes to disks and modified them , first to run on ibm computers at rutherford - appleton lab and later to run on the isc 's own vax computers . david and his wife , pat , opened their home over the years to graciously host many isc employees arriving from abroad . pat also often translated macroseismic reports for the bulletin and abstracts for the bibliography . in 1977 david became deputy director of the isc and was responsible amongst other duties for selecting the technologies that the isc embraced to collect , process and edit an ever - growing volume of data . over time , david became an important part of the centre 's institutional memory and his contribution to its development has been uniquely valuable . he has generously offered to help recover data from the isc 's archive tapes as the centre establishes a modern database . dmitry storchak promoted to senior seismologist seismologist dmitry storchak has accepted a permanent appointment as senior seismologist . dmitry earned his ph.d. in 1994 from the russian academy institute of physics of the earth . he has participated in several seismic hazard analysis projects , including compilation of catalogues for gshap . dmitry first joined the isc in 1995 for an intas - funded project on consolidation of data from regional catalogues . he rejoined the centre to edit the bulletin full - time on a two - year appointment from early 1997 . dmitry is the longest - serving seismologist now at the centre , and has benefited from interaction with robin adams , wayne richardson , reinhard mittag and anthony hughes . over the last year , dmitry has helped to train alison bird and worked with carol tubby to develop a new editing system that allows keying directly from marked listings . since it avoids manually writing event and record numbers to coding sheets , the new system is both more efficient and less error prone . dmitry , his wife oxana and his daughter katya , who now may never lose her distinctive " berkshire " accent . new seismologist hired as recommended by the executive committee at its meeting in july , the centre has been seeking an additional seismologist to help reduce the accumulated backlog in bulletin production . we received applications from many well - qualified candidates , and we were able to choose among seismologists with outstanding credentials and years of directly relevant experience . mr. mamy andrianirina of the malagasy republic has accepted a two - year appointment at the centre , and we expect him to join us in november . mamy holds university degrees in physics and chemistry and a post - graduate diploma in seismology . he has located regional and teleseismic earthquakes for the institute and observatory of geophysics , antananarivo , since 1989 . mamy participated recently in the seismology course of the international institute of seismology and earthquake engineering in japan , and daisuke suetsugu rates him as one of the best participants in 35 years . distinguished visitors stephen cox , executive secretary of the royal society , paid an informal visit to the isc in august . among other topics , mr. cox offered suggestions on sources of supplementary funding , including the royal society international exchange programme . with some other funding agencies , such as the uk national environment research council and the european science foundation , the royal society may be able to provide references to support applications from the isc . david rendel , the local member of parliament , visited the isc in september . mr. rendel promised to support the isc , and featured the centre in his weekly newspaper column the following week . he offered suggestions on grants to support educational outreach programmes in the isc 's neighbourhood . new on the web site the complete bulletin , january 1964 � april 1996 , is now available from the isc web site , at www.isc.ac.uk/bulletin . data from before 1994 were put on - line in late september following configuration of further disk space . the program for selecting events has been modified to include magnitude and amplitude criteria . users may now select events within rectangular regions or based on distance from arbitrary locations . there is a new option that begins to take advantage of the hypertext capabilities of the web within the bulletin data itself . if the " include links " option is selected , each primary origin is presented as a link to the associated phase readings and each harvard m w is linked to the complete solution for that event at the harvard university cmt project web site . more work stations installed three further sun workstations were installed at the isc in september , bringing the total to 5 . with retirement of the vax growing ever closer , this is an important step in the centre 's computer modernisation programme , which is partially funded by the us nsf . putting computing capability on the desktop of each isc staff member will enable centre operations to evolve away from batch processing towards an interactive model . one immediate benefit is a many - fold reduction in processing time ; runs that took several hours on the vax take only a few minutes on the suns . another benefit is that seismologists editing the bulletin can more easily link processes together , for example by leaving several utilities running in separate windows and pasting results from one into another . reorganisation of data management begins the isc has purchased the oracle 8 relational database management system . migration of the isc data to a coherent management system is an important element in the centre 's draft long - range plan ( available in postscript format from www.isc.ac.uk/documents ) . ultimately , a relational database is intended to replace the current system of managing data in a variety of different formats as it is collected , processed , edited and finally distributed to users . the management system will provide quicker and more flexible data retrieval , which is important as access to isc data from its web site grows . the database management system also helps to insure integrity of the data while multiple users are updating it simultaneously . this is an essential service for the isc as it moves towards an interactive system for editing the bulletin . the selection of oracle 8 was based on oracle 's strong position in the data management software field , success of other seismic data centres implementing oracle data management systems , and favourable pricing compared with other vendors . by sharing a common data management system with other seismic data centres , the isc may have more opportunities to exchange lessons and perhaps even to share software . isc papers at the esc dmitry storchak and ray willemann each presented a paper at the european seismological commission 's general assembly in tel aviv during august . ray discussed isc regional thresholds , described in last quarter 's update . dmitry 's paper , co - authored by alison bird and robin adams , compared the locations of the same events in the reviewed event bulletin of the gsett-3 idc , the earthquake data reports of the us neis , and the isc bulletin . most location discrepancies are less than 1 � but several per cent exceed 5 � and a few are greater than 20 � . even for events as large as m b 5.5 , discrepancies of several degrees exist and are considerably greater than the standard errors . large discrepancies are more common in a few geographic regions , especially new caledonia , kermadec , fiji , vanuatu , myanmar , ryuku islands , hindu - kush and east africa . from examination of typical examples , larger numbers of arrivals in later bulletins can produce more reliable locations even where early bulletins include no mis - associations . in other cases , the increasing number of data and availability of analysis by regional seismologists for later reports helps reveal mis - associations , enabling correction of badly mislocated events in some cases . further details are available . noted with regret robin adams , isc 's senior seismologist from 1978 to 1995 , lost his wife , thelma , to cancer in august . robin is writing a book on historical seismicity of central america , and continues to spend a few days at the centre each week to consult its collection , use its computing facilities , check for post , phone messages and e - mail , and share his good spirits and wisdom with us . admin last modified : mon nov 16 08:10:05 gmt 1998_cd _ _ however hard i try to pre - empt calamities here at bullock towers and always be a careful chap , the unexpected frequently creeps up and gives me a nasty surprise . such was the case on our recent trip to the lake district , which involved borrowing a four - berth caravan and tow car for a week so we could tour some uk campsites . i 'd never towed a caravan before and several pals chortled at the thought of me zooming up the m6 with a fraught look on my face and an expensive avondale argente swaying dangerously in our wake . the journeys certainly had potential for problems - especially if i 'd failed to attach the blessed caravan correctly - and the camping holiday itself was always likely to prove a challenge . so julie and i endeavoured to pack everything we could to ensure all went smoothly and every eventuality was covered : the first - aid kit , heaps of spare clothes , warm blankets , umbrellas , raincoats , walking boots , wellies , clothing , board games , puzzle books , insect repellent and so on . little did we realise that a traumatic incident was to occur before we 'd even collected the caravan or started the holiday . having crammed the bullockmobile to its limits with our assorted clobber , we set off early on the saturday morning and headed for the camping and caravanning club 's headquarters at coventry . young gregory sat quietly in the back , absorbed in his beano , and our miniature schnauzers , klara and trudi , snoozed in the boot section . it was the first time in seven years that we 'd included the dogs in our family holiday . usually they are dispatched to their peaceful country retreat ( the home of my in - laws ) but the camping and caravanning club 's sites are pet - friendly and the lake district , in particular , is a great place for glorious strolls with four - legged friends . so klara , who is now 13 , and trudi , 10 , were all part of the fun . having allowed extra journey time for traffic snarl - ups , we arrived far too early - as usual - and stopped for breakfast at a giant supermarket on the edge of coventry . refreshing tea and toast duly scoffed , julie and i agreed that she would browse in the shop with gregory for 10 minutes while i gave the dogs a swift ' wee - wee walk ' around the edge of the car park . klara and trudi were excited to see me again , of course , and jumped eagerly from the boot for their comfort stop . within seconds , however , klara was unexpectedly tugging on her lead so i glanced around to see what was wrong . to my horror and disbelief , she was - to all intents and purposes - dead . lying stock still on her back in the middle of the car park , our dear old dog had her eyes closed and paws sticking in the air . it was a terrible shock that left me trembling . “ come on , klara ! come on ! ” i shouted , over and over again , scooping her limp body up in my arms and returning her to the blanket in the back of the car . as i kept stroking klara and tickled her beard , my mind struggled to cope with the bizarre concept of dealing with a deceased dog at the beginning of a happy holiday . how on earth would i tell julie and gregory when they emerged cheerily from the shop ? could the trip possibly go ahead after such a tragedy ? how could i bury poor klara in the garden of bullock towers if we were marooned in the midlands ? more to the point , why do these dire experiences only ever seem to happen to me ? all of a sudden , however , klara 's beautiful hazel eyes flickered open and she slowly began to regain consciousness - peering up at me and licking my nose as if nothing had happened . what a relief ! the dog was alive and the trip was back on course . having sought out an emergency vet in the depths of rainy coventry - a typical bullock family way to begin a relaxing holiday - we were informed that she has a heart murmur and had either fainted or suffered a heart attack . indeed , our local vet has since suggested that by picking klara up rapidly and stroking her , i may actually have restarted her heart . it turns out , dear readers , that i have healing hands . the venerable klara has been put on daily medication and is being watched closely for any sudden changes in behaviour or collapses . and , with all the worry , my ash - blond hair is now almost the same shade as her speckled grey schnauzer fur ._. _ _ here you will be able to access a large quantity of past publications from the department for constitutional affairs , formerly the lord chancellor 's department . it should be noted that we can not guarantee for any of these documents that internal links will still function -

tempered . the animal rights people managed to end construction a similar building in cambridge and so , smelling victory , have gone all out to pressure oxford into abandoning its plans as well . it has led to some tough protests , court orders , dozens of claims , counter - claims and articles and some heavy duty intimidation and threatening of oxford university staff and the contractors on the building . one of the consistent points has been regular protests and marches in town - of which there was another one on saturday . i actually guessed it while walking into town when i saw no less than 10 police officers on one stretch of road . anyway , i had my camera with me and so decided to check it out . you can see the pics i took here . but i 've stuck a few on this post . whose right ? i 've given the animal rights question some thought - admittedly sparked by the protests that started in oxford nearly two years ago - and have come to the conclusion that it 's pretty much a dead issue . the fact is that , in a similar way to militant feminism , the battle has been won . there are now very strict laws and rules regulating animal experimentation in this country . the animal rights protests of the past did that , and it 's a good thing . all the arguments , pros and cons have been delved into , torn apart and patched together again and it is still the case the animal experimentation is incredibly useful for certain types of scientific work . we do n't have smoking beagles any more . instead we have serious and important research into debilitating disease . not that the situation is ideal . it is still dreadful that we need to experiment on animals , that we have n't found better and cheaper methods that do n't require living creatures . but that 's life . there will always be people that feel much more strongly than most on the issue - and good , because they will be motivated enough to keep an eye on the situation and make sure it does n't give way to past problems . likewise , i 'm a big fan of protests , even if they can be a royal pain if you 're disrupted ( which i was - i was over an hour late for my brother 's birthday party in part thanks to the delay getting out of oxford ) . protests mean people learn how to organise , and they learn how intricate and bureaucratic systems of government work . and they educate people , bring issues to the forefront , and they show the general public that not everyone is being complacent , that you * can * stand up and be counted if something bothers you enough . but what concerns me about the animal rights people at the moment is that for many , it is n't animal rights at all that they are fighting for . it 's the fact that they enjoying breaking rules and creating tension . there simply is no justification for hounding and threatening people - and that is exactly what the militant edges do - and enjoy doing . they have no right to make building workers fear for their own safety . they are only building concrete offices . there is a nasty streak running through the animal rights protest and their actions are drawing the sort of people that only want to create trouble . it is this that is creating a vicious circle between protestors and police . protestors are frustrated and seek to find someone to blame . the police are often at the end of it . the police are also invariably less than charming , which gets protestors backs up . but those protestors complaining and fussing about police harassment are living in fairyland . they have been given the right by the courts to hold regular protests in an extremely busy city centre , and the police , while not exactly chatty , are n't threatening them . they 'd know about it if they were . they want freedom of speech , they have freedom of speech . the police are obliged to make sure things do n't get out of hand , and if they fear they will , they are curt and sometimes aggressive . it 's crowd control and it works . what struck me was how disorganised and relatively unintelligent the protestors were in making their protest . if they feel the police are being overly controlling , why not change tactics ? why all gather in one spot where they can be shunted around ? why not post your plans and then change them at the last minute . why not pick out three leader types and get them to lead three different marches - appearing behind the police where they thought they 'd blocked off a road . and where are the inspiring speakers ? where are community leaders ? where 's the leaflet handing out the day before ? where are the media - savvy opportunities ? the fact that they were n't there demonstrates to me at least that the fire is out on the animal rights issue and all that remain are well - meaning people that would probably achieve more by lobbying individuals in power ; and pseudo - rebels who only want to live the fantasy of being on the run . i think it should be pointed out as well that we * know * of human beings being arrested , jailed , tortured and abused in recent years - in this country and outside , our citizens and other countries ' citizens . where are the human rights marches ? the issues but that aside , what of the story and the facts ? on the front of the leaflet handed out by " speak " at the protest is a cat with god - knows - what attached to its head . it grabs the attention , but what 's important is to find out how credible speak is . protest groups will always complain bitterly that their perspective is misrepresented , especially in the media , and that whoever they are criticising is getting away with hiding things . the sad truth though is that the protestors are invariably more guilty of misrepresenting what people say and do to their own ends . as such , it is very easy to check out a group 's credibility by investigating their claims and reviewing their materials . underneath the cat picture is a single quote . it comes from a pretty significant source : professor sir michael rawlins , chairman of the national institute of clinical excellence . he is quoted as saying : " the animal testing regime ... is utterly futile . " nice is an important organisation . it effectively decides on what people are allowed to do and not to do with drugs in the uk . that 's not to say it is n't occasionally mired in controversy , with health professionals sometimesaccusing it of having got it all wrong and misunderstood the situation . but what of the quote ? it 's the ellipsis you have to be worried about . there can be a whole world of qualification removed with those three little dots . so i did a bit of research . this quote has become a stock one used by the animal rights movement . but where does it come from ? well , from a meeting at chatham house in september 2003 . chatham is famous for its " chatham house rules " where the meeting can be reported but who said what can not be . the philosophy is that it encourages free debate . mr rawlins was there to talk to the pharmaceutical industry , as well as regulators , patient groups and so on about the challenges of drug creation in the future . his main point was that a rethink was needed as drug were becoming too expensive . and he did say the animal study regime was " utterly futile " . unfortunately i have been able to find only one contemporary source though - the daily telegraph . and it leaves mention of this quote until the very last sentence . it is also not as equivocal as it sounds : " patients must be more involved in regulatory decisions , he said . ' the population is going to have to realise there is a trade - off between absolute safety and the development of new drugs . ' the animal study regime , which could take up to six years , was ' utterly futile ' . the industry must do more research on how to conduct efficient clinical trials . " there is n't a full transcript on the chatham house website unfortunately , so this is all we have to go on . it is weak . allegations the speak leaflet makes its allegations on the back of the leaflet . it claims that oxford university " hides a nasty secret " . and that is : " behind the beautiful architecture and dreaming spires lies suffering and death in the university labs . countless thousands of animals are destined to be the latest victims of arrogance and scientific fraud inside the walls of this new facility . " emotive language aside - what is this " scientific fraud " ? the leaflet has seven points . that the university originally said there would be no experiments at the new lab being built that it then contradicted this statement by saying it would that in the labs , kittens had one eye sewn up and part of their brains removed , and that three monkeys with artificially produced brain damage were experimented on that one professor said the monkeys led " the life of riley " but in one experiment had required " intensive nursing " to keep them alive that the university sought an injunction to prevent a " legal and peaceful campaign " against the new lab that the university failed to attend a public meeting at the town hall , despite being invited that a leading professor was investigated for cruelty for refusing to allow a monkey to be put down because it was an " asset " having read these seven points , i 'm pretty sure they 're all true , albeit heavily angled . dates are given for each point and in two cases , specific publications referred to . and , having done some digging , i 've discovered that strictly speaking they are all true . but they have been bent , and elements purposefully missed out . point by point : i ca n't find the exact quote listed by speak in which the university said " no experiments would be carried out " . but it is true that the original planning application ( 02/02371/ful ) said it was to be only an " animal holding centre " . you can see the bare bones of that application here - but unfortunately a pdf of the application itself has been removed . speak says on 16 march , the university said the facility would be used to experiment on animals . again , i ca n't find an official source . but it seems perfectly feasible . the university does continue to stress that the facility fundamental purpose is for housing animals , and not for tests on them . i ca n't find the article quoted in nature , but the monkey experiments are true , and were written up in brain research bulletin 61 ( 2003 ) . you can read the abstract and buy it if you want . the point though is that oxford university did not damage the monkeys themselves , merely did experiments on them . it should also be noted that the university pointed out that a major part of the protestors ' ads around this time were incorrect . they stated that two monkeys were being held , when in fact they had been put down years before . the professor was john stein , and an interview with him appeared in the oxford mail in august 2004 . he said : " we can record from the brain absolutely painlessly . it causes them no pain or stress ... they have a life of riley compared to animals in the wild . " his counter - argument was : " for the sacrifice of a very small number of animals there 's a huge benefit to humanity . we all worry about the ethics , but as long as our experiments are done with no pain , they are justifiable."as for his research , there is no indication which paper it was , and i 'm not going to search all of prof stein 's papers to find it either . but presumably speak has been through each one with a fine - toothed comb . i suspect the quote is true , but , again , angled and bent . the " draconia " injunction . this is perfectly true and you can read the whole thing at http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/po/order10-11-04.pdf [ pdf ] . again though , the situation has been mispainted . the contractors building the facility had pulled out after being threatened personally and as a business . oxford university sought a 100-yard ban on protestors . this was rejected . instead , the size of the protests were limited to 50 people and any more would have to apply to the police . i think the court made a good decision , balancing the interests of both sides . the university did n't really fail to turn up to the town hall meeting . it never said it was going to go . it was set up by the protestors and the university declined . it said : " we will participate in any event if we receive a reasonable invitation . " that has yet to be put to the test . you can read the times story in question ( oxford inquiry on abuse of monkey ) . the case was dropped , the delay in the vet 's recommendation and the monkey being put down was 90 minutes , and the explanation was : " staff had detected illness in an animal being used in biomedical research . vets diagnosed an infection and the animal was treated with antibiotics but did not respond quickly , so euthanasia was recommended .

brownhills ( mr. shepherd ) make his case , it occurred to me that , so often over the past 20 years , his has been the sole voice of sanity on these issues , and his was a lone and courageous voice attacking the conservative government and the official secrets act that they passed . i do not want to detain the house , and i am sure that he would have answered the case on its merits , but i did not want my hon . friend the minister to think that the hon . gentleman was again speaking from the isolated position of an obsessive . the fact that the hon . gentleman has pursued these matters with such consistency and determination over the years is not the result of obsession ; his is an entirely proper interest and it is to the discredit of other members of parliament that they do not often join him in his campaigns . the hon . gentleman 's point about the degree of protection afforded by the provisions being out of tune with the times and the rest of the bill is correct . there was a time when the security services were not mentioned at all . ministers would refer to them as " the friends " , because they could not be named -- they were the shades 5 apr 2000 : column 1057 who could not be looked at directly and who were but shadowy figures in government . fortunately , things have changed over the past 10 years . we now know the names of the heads of mi5 and mi6 ; they give press conferences and they are public figures . their headquarters are , at last , a publicly recognised building . the fact that that building is one of the most appalling pieces of architecture ever to blot the london skyline , and that disgraceful sums were spent on it , is a separate matter . i hasten to add that i have a great liking and respect for the excellent architect , even if it is one of the worst buildings of his distinguished career . the building 's public profile is symbolic of the fact that we now recognise the existence of mi5 and mi6 , but by putting such a huge rampart around all their activities , the bill does not afford them the same degree of recognition . even the most innocuous and simple matters of public expenditure within that building , such as tenders for furniture and services , maintenance costs , and the number of people on full - time contracts , are outwith parliamentary scrutiny . that can not make sense . no risk is posed to national security by allowing a degree of scrutiny of innocuous matters -- scrutiny that is carefully controlled through a prejudice test that would filter out questions that might prejudice our security , which is something that no member of parliament or citizen of this country would want to do . the government have slightly misjudged the changes surrounding the security services -- changes that they and the previous government made . i hope that , between consideration here and in the other place , ministers will consider , even at this late stage , the possibility that they are being too cautious . nobody wants information about the security functions of the security services , but they have plenty of other functions and are connected with plenty of other matters of public concern and public expenditure that fall properly within the public domain . mr. dale campbell - savours ( workington ) : under existing systems , that material can already enter the public domain . it is filtered through a committee , and the only material that is excised from the reports of that committee relates essentially to the security of the state and operational matters . hence i can not understand my hon . friend 's concern . mr. fisher : i am grateful for my hon . friend 's intervention , because he makes my point for me : the information is available , so the bill that gives us the right of access to information should recognise that . the import of my hon . friend 's remarks is that we have nothing to fear -- the information is already out . my argument is that that should be recognised in the bill . the bill will codify the degree and the extent of the access that we as a nation have to information . it is wonderful that the committee of which my hon . friend is a distinguished member brings such matters to our attention , and that it has functions other than action as a conduit for information . however , we and that committee would be strengthened if we recognised the reality of the security services as they are today . we should incorporate them in the bill in a proper sense , not in the slightly neurotic sense revealed by the bill 's current wording . mr. mike o'brien : i agree with much that was said by the hon . member for aldridge - brownhills 5 apr 2000 : column 1058 ( mr. shepherd ) and my hon . friend the member for stoke - on - trent , central ( mr. fisher ) . i had the privilege to be a member of the select committee on home affairs when , in 1992 , for the first time , the committee decided to go and see the then director - general of mi5 and thereby started the process of opening up those issues . many other members of parliament , especially the hon . member for aldridge - brownhills , have played a far more substantial role in that process than i have ever played . 8.45 pm it is my view and that of my right hon . friend the home secretary and many members of the government that much can be done more openly with the various security services -- the secret intelligence service , the security service , and the government communications headquarters -- to ensure that we have a more accountable intelligence operation . however , i do not agree that the bill and the at - a - stroke approach that the hon . gentleman advocates are the way to do that . over recent years we have been feeling our way towards more openness . the various security services have taken the view that they want to be more open , and they have moved quite a long way in that direction . no doubt we are only part way through the process , and in years to come we will move further . the hon . member for aldridge - brownhills says that the words " national security " are heavy words . indeed , they are . this country has been subject to bombing and terrorism , and it has had a great need for a very effective intelligence service to protect our national security . it is right , therefore , that we treat with great respect the work that is done by our national security services . i take this opportunity to pay tribute , which i am sure the house would echo , to the work done by the security services in dealing with northern irish terrorism in particular , but also terrorism from other parts of the world , to which our country has been subjected . for the sake of my family and the families of all my constituents and others in this country , i want to be sure that our security services are able to do the work that we have asked them to do . it is extremely sensitive and difficult work , and it is right that in that context , there has always been a consensus in the house that we should treat with great care any intrusion into the operational activities of our security services . i am grateful for the support of the then conservative front - bench spokesman , the hon . member for ryedale ( mr. greenway ) , who said when we discussed clause 21 in committee that the opposition also agree with the minister and the government that clause 21 should be an absolute exemption.-- [ official report , standing committee b , 20 january 2000 ; c. 211 . ] we propose to keep it as such . mr. fisher : i am grateful to my hon . friend . he says , rightly , that the government and he , during his career in the house from 1992 , have been involved in creating greater openness . everyone welcomes that , and when he moved the amendment , the hon . member for aldridge - brownhills ( mr. shepherd ) recognised the big shift that has taken place . however , my hon . friend seems to be sliding into the misunderstanding that has bedevilled debate on the bill in committee and now on report , confusing greater openness with freedom of information . 5 apr 2000 : column 1059 the government have been much more open in this area , as were the previous government . that is welcome , but it is quite different from what we are doing through the bill -- that is , establishing rights to access to information . openness and freedom of information are two completely separate matters , and my hon . friend is making the mistake of answering one with the other . mr. o'brien : i certainly do not mean to make a mistake , and i am not sure that i have done so . as clause 76 makes clear , there is nothing in the bill that requires secrecy . there is nothing in any clause that will require the security services or any other organisation to keep information confidential that they could put into the public arena . my hon . friend says that he seeks to establish rights for members of the public , some of whom may be genuine and some of whom may bear our country ill will , to obtain information about the security services . i would approach that area with a great deal of caution . i do not think that there is sufficient caution in the amendments . let me set out the reasons for that . mr. oliver heald ( north - east hertfordshire ) : the minister mentioned the opposition 's view . i wish simply to place on record that we retain that view . mr. o'brien : i am grateful to the hon . gentleman for confirming that at least the front - bench members , and probably the majority of hon . members , believe that we should allow the security services to do the job for which we pay them and that they do so well . some protection and , indeed , secrecy is necessary to retain and foster the exchange of information that underpins the intelligence effort . clause 21 removes from the scope of the bill all the information supplied by or relating to the work of the agencies listed in subsection ( 3 ) . it has been suggested that it is highly unlikely that information on security matters would be disclosed because of the way in which some of the exemptions operate . however , the amendments would encourage applicants to believe that such information would be disclosed . in practice , that expectation would be unreasonable , given the nature of the information . we do not wish to feed such expectations . the amendments would significantly weaken the protection in the bill for information supplied by or relating to the work of the security and intelligence services . i ask the house to reject the amendments on that basis . amendments nos . 93 to 95 would change the operation of clause 22 . amendments nos . 93 and 94 would limit exemption to information that did not fall within the scope of clause 21 , but the disclosure of which would or would be likely to prejudice national security . amendments nos . 95 and 96 would remove the certification process from clauses 21 and 22 . however , there are good reasons for the way in which the clause is drafted . the amendments would negate them . we do not believe that a single omnibus harm test , which amendments nos . 93 and 94 propose , is appropriate for all exemptions . we must frame the exemption to fit 5 apr 2000 : column 1060 the information and thus properly protect the public interest . i am sure that the hon . member for aldridge - brownhills agrees that unless the public interest demands its disclosure , such information should not be disclosed if its retention is required to safeguard national security . the clause ensures that that is the case . the exemption applies only when it is required ; the test is of necessity , not desirability . the clause is drafted in similar terms to section 28 of the data protection act 1998 . the two provisions have the same purpose . it is therefore sensible for them to be drafted in similar language . any difference in approach between the provisions could lead to them being interpreted differently . clearly , that is not the intention . government policy is clear on the sensitive subject that we are discussing . any move from the existing formulation would suggest that the government intended the provision to be interpreted differently . the government will not accept any amendment that would risk reducing the protection . let us consider evidential certificates . that information is extremely sensitive , and access to it must necessarily be restricted to the smallest number of people possible . disclosure in the course of enforcing freedom of information must be to the extent necessary to ensure that the exemption is not being abused , and no further . in that unique instance , it is not appropriate for the information commissioner to have a role in assessing whether the exemption applies . without any disrespect to the information commissioner or her staff , disclosure to her of such sensitive material is not appropriate . for example , the material requested might be a small piece of a jigsaw . determining the seriousness , importance or sensitivity may require the information commissioner to know the whole context . that of itself would be undesirable . furthermore , such disclosure would not be necessary to ensure that the exemption was not abused . first , the certification procedure would restrict the power to sign such a certificate to a cabinet minister , the attorney - general , the attorney - general for northern ireland or the advocate - general for scotland . a certificate could be signed only at the highest level . furthermore and crucially , it is important to be clear that those certificates would not operate as ministerial vetoes . the certificates that may be issued under clause 21(2 ) and clause 22(3 ) would be nothing more than evidential certificates . the minister would certify that the information was of the kind specified , not that it should or should not be secret , although that would bear on the eventual use of the certificate . the commissioner or the applicant could challenge the certificate in the tribunal , which would have the power to determine whether it was reasonably issued or , in the case of a certificate issued under clause 21 , whether it related to the information of the kind specified . therefore , that would not be a ministerial veto . there are good grounds for formulating clauses 21 and 22 as they stand and for the existence of a procedure , with relevant safeguards , for certifying that the information falls within the clauses . however , that does not mean that the security services need secrecy where that is unnecessary . no doubt my hon . friend the member for workington ( mr. campbell - savours ) , other members of the committee that oversees the security services and others will introduce a procedure , as the years pass , under which they are able to be more open where that is 5 apr 2000 : column 1061 appropriate , but only where that is appropriate . it is not appropriate to make those changes at a stroke under the bill . we need to ensure that we protect those who protect us at any difficult time -- now as much as any other -- when our national security could be threatened . we have a duty to them to do so just as they have a duty to us in the work that they carry out ._. _ _ mademoiselle la maupin , an actress who died in 1707 , was trained in swordfighting by her father . she issued more than one challenge to duel , and was pardonned by king louis xiv after killing several men in one evening at a ball .

' no way in , no way out ' is highly infectious , whilst ' foolin ' around ' has a lovely optimistic feel and the opener , ' i will ' really reminded me of leroy hutson 's ' get to this , you 'll get to me ' . lovely set . check soul brother for copies . links all over the site . little beaver 's set arrived in yesterday . came as a complete surprise , as i thought his material had all seen the light of day . tk 's mentor , henry stone sent me this album . renaissance man , as they say . henry presided over gwen mccrae 's recent album , that little beaver worked on . the material here covers a three year period between 1970 and 1973 . i am amazed this has n't seen the light of day . it is wonderful , and definitely in my record box at the next gig i get to do in the future . very james brown / charles wright in sound , with ' everybody has some dues to pay ' being an irresistable dancefloor track . there are some great dancers and ballads throughout here . ' miami girl ' is a gorgeous song . i e - mailed henry regarding this set . if there is further information available regarding these tunes , i will post it here . folks used to say , if you were a deejay , ' when in doubt , james brown out ' . well you can add little beaver to that list ! henrystonemusic@aol.com top of the page � various artists - atlantic unearthed : soul brothers i was going to place this album on the reissues page , but it is far too important a set for one reason . it has one of the greatest soul songs i have ever heard on this set . in fact , i have n't listened to any of the other tracks here at all . the album arrived here and i noticed there was an unreleased donny hathaway song included here . always loved his music . stuck it in the stereo and could n't move for about 5 minutes after the song had finished . it 's only 2 and a half minutes long . to tell you the honest truth , i am scares me to put the cd in the stereo . this song is perfect . it is called ' what a woman really means ' . it epitomises why i love this music so much . i 've always loved donny 's vocal styling so much . roberta flack did a version of this song , i am told . this version has n't been out before . quite one of the best songs i have heard in my life . goosepimples ? and the rest . this song has stopped me listening to anything else in the last week . it is disabling , is my best description for this old fool . over the top ? well , i was cooking for my wife and daughter yesterday evening and , after i had recommended the tune to py at smooth fm , he played it . i was just pleased the women were out of the kitchen . i lost it again ! lol . if sheer beauty could be encaptured in music , well this is it . this is up there with ' what 's going on ' and songs of that standard . if it does n't move you , then you need to go see your doctor . absolutely a stunning , stunning song . you have to have this . i played it to tashan and my friend chris bangs . chris just said ' superb ' . tashan said ' wow toby , 2:48 seconds of soulful bliss ' . chris is very choosy regarding music , so ' superb ' is really him saying ' that is just fantastic ' . we watched the england game during the week and he said to me ' when that song get 's to the middle , it moves into another dimension ' . music really is the healing force of the world , as the o'jays once sang . it does n't matter who musically turns you on , as long as something musically does . donny hathaway . ' what a woman really means ' . even my daughter grace said to me ' does n't he have a really nice voice ? ' well he has a tune to go with it . this will keep me going for the rest of the year , and probably my life . lovely , lovely song . i remember the deejay john peel once saying he heard an undertones tune called ' teenage kicks ' whilst driving his car , and he had to pull over onto the hard shoulder of the motorway and he lost it . well , snap!. john just knew the right buttons that that band had pushed that did it for him . same for you guys , i am sure . donny 's tune is now in my favourites from the last hundred years ( hate the term ' all time ' ) why donny took his life , well who knows . some of us male girls go to some dark places in our heads , i guess . wish he was still with us . my personal belief is that , if he knew how much he would have been missed , he may have thought twice about taking his life . who knows ? one thing i would say , is that taking that course of action does effect many folks close to you , and i believe that people ought to think about others and how they may feel if you were n't here . i am going to play this song again now , so no - one bother me for a few minutes ! lol top of the page � corinne bailey rae - corinne bailey rae / underground soul - various artists got a feeling of deja vu ? well corinne bailey rae 's album , i actually reviewed a sampler of back before christmas . reason why i am going back to the set is that the nice folks in the states are just about to be introduced to this fine new u.k. singer . if you reside in the u.k.,most soul fans will already have this fine set of songs by now , and quite rightly so . since the christmas review , well corinne has had huge success in the u.k. with this album . many t.v. appearances on shows such as the jools holland show here as well as a great deal of t.v. advertising . i bought a copy for my daughter for her birthday , which she hid from me ! all her school friends like this album , my wife likes this album , and obviously i do as well . people i played it to like it , ( that was until my daughter hid it ! lol ) . i think the reason for all this is because corinne has some depth within her music . she 's not lightweight , and has offered the public something that , i believe , the public want . quality . not the rubbish that makes certain mainstream music programmes . people yearn for something that is n't the stuff we are currently being spoonfed . corinne 's vocal delivery is almost childlike . hope she does n't mind me saying that . women like this album . corinne 's singing style is n't too dis - similar to that of the late minnie riperton , along with the usual comparison 's folks make with eryka badu . pretty high praise , and pretty accurate . a fine foundation for , what will become a fruitful career . i defy anyone to tell me this wo n't make many a christmas stocking . if you have n't got a copy , well you 're not having mine ! my copy is my business ! the underground soul set is real nice and has a certain track by one corinne bailey rae ! that 's why i paired these two together . i have to say that that particular track is probably my favourite song thus far by the woman . this cd has been lovingly compiled by a woman called eleonora for expansion records . eleonora represents the underground-soul.com website . some very nice songs here , including input from the excellent artists noel mckoy , jill scott , donna gardier , monday michiru and the wonderful deborah bond . well worth picking up for any of those songs . if you like corinne bailey rae , however , you 'll need this . check amazon for corinne 's album and soul brother for eleonora 's fine expansion compilation . both highly recommended . top of the page � teena marie - sapphire / mike avery - destination love teena marie albums are like london buses . you wait for ages for one and then two come along at the same time . i guess the passing of rick james has motivated the woman into burying herself in her work . those guys were pretty close . just my take on matters , that 's all . teena is just about the best female singer out there thesedays , bar aretha . funny , but the cover .... well not sure if it was an intentional gesture , but is n't she a dead ringer for gillian anderson from the x files ? the music ? well , fabulous is an understatement . her voice is very similar to gwen mccrae 's thesedays , not in sound , but the pair of them do share one thing in common . they sound better than at any time in their careers . teena is also similar to dusty springfield in as much as black audiences have no problem in embracing their vocal delivery . in many ways , dusty 's and teena 's style 's are almost pleading when listening to these great women . the music ? well there are no bad tracks here . a lovely duet with smokey robinson on ' cruise control ' , a fabulous mid tempo melody called ' make it hot ' , a gorgeous ballad called ' you blow me away ' , well you pays your money , but paying your money is essential . lovely , lovely album . mind you teena does n't make bad records , does she ? check amazon for copies . mike avery is a new name to me . this is on his own label and is stocked at cd baby right now . his bio says ' mike avery needs no introduction ' there , which is not that true as i did n't know about the man until i read his biography at that web page . funny , when folks say that ' here is a man who needs no introduction ' . if that is the case , why are they introduced ? lol . me rambling again . this is another fabulous album . mike used to be in a band called new image , then moving to a group called the wrecking crew . he has also worked with mavis staples and r kelly in recent years . you can hear some of the songs from this album , if you want to test the musical water at cd baby . personal favourites ? the opener ' miss lady ' is an absolute gorgeous stepper . worth the price of the album alone . the title track is real nice , ' loveland ' is a nice mid tempo offering , ' i 'll be watching you ' is another lovely song . all told , you need this for ' miss lady ' , which will be in my year end top 10 easily . a very ' song led ' album , which is streets ahead of the eurovision five heavy metal werewolves with leprosy from finland , that i witnessed at that song contest last saturday . i have my lawyers on the case regarding a breach of the trades description act , concerning the use of the word ' song ' ! lol . http://cdbaby.com/cd/averymike top of the page � letha - up from under / van hunt - on the jungle floor letha got in touch with me a while back . an independent artist , looking for a deal . what you are looking at above is the amazing package that letha sent me . when your kid says to you ' i made it myself ' , well letha certainly makes this feel real homemade . nice change from the glossy packages that arrive from some of the bigger artists out there . the biggest problem i had with this album was n't anything to do with the music , which is very nice . no the problem was my daughter took a shine to the clipboard , so i had to fight her off ! lol . the file that letha has put together , obviously has her cd inside , along with imagery , including the woman sitting writing , fully clothed , in the bath with her laptop next to her ! not sure what health and safety would say about that ! lol the music ? well , i hate the term ' nu organic soul ' , however , this best describes where the woman is coming from , musically . songs interspersed with dialogue . normally i am not keen on the genre , however , letha has a charm in her music , and , as with many americans , a polite innocence , which is irresistable . letha told me this will go up on cd baby soon . i am sure she would admit this is n't a ' what 's going on ' , however , it is a good start and bodes well for her future . remember , easy to criticise , hard to create . more power to your elbow sista . http://cdbaby.com/cd/letha van hunt stares out of the cd cover looking like tierry henry 's brother ! lol seperated at birth ? tierry henry is an arsenal soccer player based in london , for those of you who have n't the foggiest idea who i am referring to . do n't worry , even my wife does n't know what i am waffling on about half the time ! if you check the upcoming world cup , he is just about the best player in the world right now . o.k. , waffling again ! lol i really like van hunt . the man almost made it through the back door onto the soul scene with his first album . that was excellent and this is on a par with that . both albums take a few plays to get under your skin , but under your skin is where they get . this set , even if you only like one track , that would have to be ' hole in my heart ' . fantastic tune . i think one day he will move to another popularity level . in the meantime , all we have to do is just enjoy the man 's music and wait for the rest of the rabble to catch up . far more enjoyable than watching 5 finnish heavy metal werewolves with leprosy winning the eurovision song contest ! lol . you can get this set at amazon . top of the page � frank mccomb - the 1995 bootleg / karen bernod - life @ 360 degrees frank mccomb is an artist , that you have to see live , if he is ever in town . quite a remarkable singer really , whom some compare to stevie wonder in sound , although , to these ears is very much more set within the donny hathaway mould . funny thing is , he is almost too good for his own musical boots ! thesedays we like to be told what to like by the industry , the next frank sinatra soundalike , or if it does n't sound like a mobile phone ringtone , then it just is n't worth any of our hard earned money . all i can say , is most of us music lovers out there ' love music ' and not folks 's mobile phone ring tones going off to a ' house beat ' . this album i have had in my collection for a while now . frank used to be with sony , then motown were going to release this set , but nothing happened with it , but then copies started changing hands . by the time it arrived here , the music was great , but the quality was n't all that . i loved the songs on this set . poor frank played live gigs and was presented with pirate copies of his own album for him to autograph ! brass neck or what . i figured this excellent album would be tied up with so many legal issues , that it would never see the light of day . frank has taken the reigns , as far as his career is concerned , and we finally get to hear something that might actually make the man some money . i wo n't run through this track by track . i could use so many superlatives , you just wo n't find a much better album released this year . all the links you need are below . highly recommended indeed . dome records have taken under their wings karen bernod for her second album outing . many parts of the industry would pigeonhole her as ' nu organic soul ' , however , that brings on connotations of moodiness and eryka badu soundalikes . this is a hugely cheerful album , with karen being very funny in some spoken parts of this lovely set of ' soul songs ' , not nu this or that . ' dreamer ' is almost will downing in delivery , odd as will took the sleeve images , and they are of a very high standard indeed . i loved the uplifting flirtations relating to the song ' subway love game ' , which finds karen ' stalking ' fellow passengers ! lol . ' family ' is a beautiful ballad , very personal in content , and , all told , this is well worth picking up . as with expansion , dome 's releases are all of the highest standard ( and no , i am not on any sort of payroll ! lol ) . another winner . www.frankmccomb.info www.boobeescootmusic.com www.myspace.com/frankmccombmusic top of the page � gwen mccrae - gwen mccrae sings tk / prince - 3121 / various - the spirit of philadelphia vol.2 last saturday , i went to see gwen mccrae at the jazz cafe here in london . we have been in touch for a while now . i met gwen last summer at her last gig there . she is a very sweet person . this time round i took some friends along as guests of the soulpower crew . real nice people . very easy going . they took us up to meet gwen before the show , and we took some photo 's . whilst we were chatting gwen gave me a cd she had just recorded , which is , basically , an album of tk remakes ( although there is one new song on the set ) . got up sunday morning , with a sore head , and put the album on the player . gwen 's voice sounds really great thesedays . her show was marvellous . if this album had been recorded by joss stone , everyone would be raving about it , as she fits todays industry template . what is lovely about this set , is gwen has almost recorded the album joss might have made herself . her album , last time round included some southern soul greats . gwen has the likes of timmy thomas , little beaver , george ' chocolate ' perry , latimore , k.c. , amongst many others on board here . the new song is called ' you got ta love me ( like i love me ) ' which is a duet with k.c. great song . there are versions of ' rock your baby ' , ' party down ' , ' misty blue ' , ' let 's straighten it out ' , and my personal favourite , gwen 's take on ' honey , honey ' , real soul perfection to these old ears . in many ways not too dis - similar to her ' i can only think of you ' song from a few years back . biased ? possibly , however , you ca n't deny it when you hear real quailty . this certainly is that . hugely recommended and on the www.henrystonemusic.com website . welcome back sista . prince certainly has had an interesting career . one day he is a ' prince ' , another day he is a ' symbol ' . his appearance at the u.k. music awards a few years back , raised some eyebrows . in a way , i think he has run the gauntlet , within the industry , that michael jackson has had to . michael , bless his heart , has never been allowed to go through the childhood experiences that the rest of us have been allowed to do , which in a way was very unkind and he should have been supported and allowed to mature without the attention of the media , now that , remember , he has been proven to be innocent of everything the media wanted him to be guilty of . perhaps we should ' hound ' a few journalists and take photo 's of them at all hours ? prince , however , has ' ducked and dived ' . the man has been very clever in his handling the media , mainly as they do n't know what to make of him ! he has been his own rebel / man . one thing i would say about him is he is a very good employer . helped many with their careers , from the likes of sheena easton , rosie gaines , all the way to the likes of mavis staples along the way . personally , as with his persona 's , there are two sides of this artist , as far as i am concerned . one side produces songs such as ' rasberry beret ' and ' when dove 's cry ' , the other that records songs such as ' sign of the times ' and the incredibly undrerrated ' silly games ' . guess you know which side of the man 's music i prefer . the thing with prince 's recent material , is that , even if you dislike many of the tracks , there is alway a gem buried in there somewhere . personally , i like this set . the title track is a great funky opener , ' love ' is a nice mid tempo offering , ' the word ' is moody and catchy , and ' beautiful , loved and blessed ' is a nice , sort of ' stepper ' . my personal favourite is the second to last track ' the dance ' , which is a haunting mid - tempo melody , almost samba in style . the type of track that only this artist can carry off . interesting album , but it would be would n't it ? you can pick this up most places . not hard to find . last , but certainly not least , is the second release in the ' spirit of philadelphia ' series from expansion records . one thing you can say about this label , is you can , pretty much , pick up any of their releases and find pure quality within the melodies . i reviewed the first of the series at the site and this is of an equally high standard . philadelphia turned out some great music . when most folks talk about the label , it conjures memories of the likes of the o'jays , harold melvin and the blue notes , jean carne , the jones girls , the three degrees etc . great music , however , in other parts of the city , and away from the gamble and huff set - up , there were other artists recording some great sides , many times with the same musicians . this is where these excellent compilations focus in on . before i talk about the music , i must say that the sleevenotes and liner notes are always impeccable . roger williams cover designs are highly impressive ( and that comes from someone who works within the industry ) . o.k. the music . well , the starting line - up is impressive . ben e. king , eddie kendricks , the whispers , the four tops , new york city and the recent vince montana melody , ' that 's what love does ' , which has become a club anthem in the u.k. recently . 17 tracks of philly gems . if you like the label , you 'll love this . compiled by ralph tee , who has far better taste than i do , so you wo n't be disappointed . as peter young once said to me , when ralph was on the airwaves , ' i listen to his show to find out what i 'll be playing in 6 month 's time ' ! high praise from a great soul veteran . check soul brother for copies . top of the page � hil st. soul - soulidified / the whispers - for your ears only hil st. soul are almost a bridge between the ' new r & b ' and the old skool style of material and delivery . hilary mwelwa has a lovely vocal styling . i would not be brutally honest if i did n't say that , the new r & b side of the scene is n't my cup of earl grey , however , with hilary 's vocals , this listener does n't get to reach for the skip button on the remote . i am sure that , on a trip to the jazz cafe in london , i bumped into hilary , in the street , and asked her if she was ledisi ! i am not a complete idiot , but i 'm still trying to work out what piece is missing ! lol . sorry hilary ! mind you , they do look similar to each other . you can tell ledisi , as she has the cider i spilled on her feet , which i also did the same night ! idiot as i said . this album is going to hit the streets on the shanachie label in the near future . it is listed at amazon at the moment as well . i particularly like the songs ' it 's o.k. ' , ' hey boy ' and the opener ' sweet on you ' . ' betta days ' samples eddie kendricks ' ' intimate friends ' very nicely . one funny aside ( which i am sure is intentional ) is that the first 3 songs all have the following tracks titles within the lyrics . certainly confused this old fool ! highly recommended urban contemporary release . very talented artist . i guess , my only concern with this set is that daytime radio has become so bland , this set will need the oxygen of the internet for sales . well , as far as the whispers go , for this listener , they can do no wrong . what amazes me about this album , is how fresh this veteran group still sound . walter & scotty 's voices sound exactly the same as they did back in the seventies . i know i have joked about the boys going so far back , that you might find a cylinder recording or a 78 by the band in your local second hand store , well , these guys have my ' w ' section nicely filled here , already . this is another wonderful addition to their curriculum vitae . the opener ' get it on ' pays homage to the classic soul acts from the previous couple of decades . a great dancer . the guys cover of major harris 's evergreen ' love wo n't let me wait ' , uptempo 's the original . found it very interesting to hear their version of the song ' livin ' it up ' , which i have as an italian twelve by a group called bros2 featuring mike francis , released back in 1990 . most of this set comprises of original material . they even have teena marie helping on writing and production chores on the offering called ' butta ' . ' i sing this song for you ' is absolutely gorgeous . a dedication to the man upstairs guess , with the able help of the emmanuel baptist church choir of san jose . what with their impeccable harmonies , ollie woodson on board , you have a lovely , lovely recording here . unreservedly recommended . one of the best of 2006 , i think . top of the page � the persuaders - made to be loved / sargent tucker - ... and comrades the persuaders are perhaps best remembered for their soul evergreen ' thin line between love and hate ' . what a great song that was . this new album was a real nice surprise . i must confess i was n't too sure as to what to expect when i put this on the player here . it was , obviously , going to be very much old school , and sure it is just that , however , there is much more to this set than meets the ' ear ' . if you were into the recent temptations releases , then , this will be very pleasing to you . in many ways , the songs , not only remind me of the temptations , but there are inflections of recent dells material here as well . i guess these guys vocal deliveries have matured with time , obviously , and thank heavens for that . couple of covers here . lovely take on burt bacharach 's chestnut ' a house is not a home ' and glady 's knight 's ' you 're the best thing that ever happened to me ' . the original material is contemporary , and not too much ' in your face ' , which is a relief in this current environment of ' american pop idol ' ( why do n't these guys listen to those close to them and give us all a little peace ! half of them sound like they are in pain ! maybe we should put them out of their misery ! lol ) . the persuaders could sing any of those latest michael jackson 's on that show off the stage , and the guys prove that with the very temptations ' stay ' , sounding ' she 's mine ' . what a great song . real soul is still alive and well , thankfully . soul brother will have copies of this , so check the link below . highly recommended and strong throughout . welcome back soul brothers ! sargent tucker 's people sent me several copies of this cd . their website is at www.anadarecords.com . out of california , this is an unusual item as the mixture of musical genre 's allows the various styles to do their thing , ranging from rock to smooth jazz , to soul music . when i review material at this site , i will not lead the visitor down a path that might let them think that i am under the instruction of a company or individual .... so , i am actively going to say that i completely miss some of the rock music on this set . having said that , the smooth jazz material is listenable , but just that , unfortunately . the interesting material is sargent 's own input , especially on the songs ' all the squares ' and the richer ' i need your love ' . reminded me a little of the beach music set reviewed at the site last year . a notable cd for these songs , and you do get instrumentals of these tracks thrown in . i would like , personally , to hear an album by the sargent on his own entirely . as i have said before , these are the artists ' babies ' , understanding that it is easy to criticise , but hard to create as well . good luck to the label , and the artists out there . i am sure that there will be those out there that love the material here i do not . down to taste all told . top of the page � steve ' the scotsman ' harvey - the everyday people project / jiva - sun and moon more from the excellent expansion record label here . two very nice releases to move us out of the winter period on on , hopefully towards spring , although it is still pretty cold right now here in london . steve harvey has been around for a while now , as a songwriter and producer . he was behind the excellent donnie debut album , frank mccomb 's ' the truth ' album , along with many other projects over the years . i mentioned donnie as he makes an appearance on this cd , which is , almost , a showcase of various artists who could be described as nu organic soul . i think that verbal label isolates the artists a little . musical segregation if you like . the thing is , as i have said before , there are only two types of music in the listeners perceived ear . good and bad . the team line up here is pretty impressive . there is a very nice starter from the excellent ledisi . quite why she has n't been more widely embraced by the states , musically , as she stands head and shoulders above many vocalists out there . there is a real nice tune called ' where has the love gone ' , by a newcomer to this old soulboy , called k.k. ( glad there were only two ' k 's there ! ) . rahsaan patterson weighs in with the excellent ' that 's the way ' . fine stuff . as usual , i do have a favourite cut , which comes in the form of linn segolson 's lovely ' troubled times ' . great music . nice set available from soul brother . jiva are a new name to me . the blurb tells me that they were with giant step records . that is an excellent label . this is a very nicely constructed , part soul and part samba , set of recordings . you get dance songs as well as some lovely mid - tempo material . parts reminded me of some of minnie ripertons material , especially on the track ' free falling ' . ' swept away ' is another delightful piece of soul samba , and i know if robbie vincent was still on the air , he would be rotating ' confessions of a man ' heavily . that is a great track . parts of this set almost hark back to the days of the late seventies fusion . more power to these guys elbows . some nice alternative mixes thrown in for good measure . nice to put on a sunday morning and just enjoy . available at soul brother as well . real instruments , very enjoyable all round , and highly recommended . top of the page � anthony hamilton - ai n't nobody worryin ' / syleena johnson - chapter three : the flesh anthony hamilton 's people sent me the man 's last outing . i really liked that set , so i reviewed it at the site . anthony is an interesting artist , as there are certain performers that you believe will come up with a work of real genius during their careers . i read bill buckley 's review of this set in the pages of blues and soul magazine . bill was raving about a track called ' change your world ' , almost to the point of ignoring the rest of the set . it was album of the fortnight . reviewing albums could be compared to those who are elitest regarding themselves being the only individuals owning a copy of a certain track . once one person has reviewed an album , then that is their domain . i respect bill 's opinions and i have no problem in raising his arm and letting the man know he is right on the button with this tune ! what a fantastic song . you need this song . do n't get me wrong , the rest of this album is excellent , however , anthony has hit that little piece of genius that takes ' change your world ' onto another level completely . you will now want to ask me ' o.k. then toby , what does this song sound like ? ' well if you ever yearned for the days of the classic philadelphia international ballad , or the delfonics releasing another classic melody , well this is for you . for me there 's even a touch of the vee allen / david peaston song ' can i ? ' song of the year . anthony wandered off into the studio next door to pitch in his fine musical abilities on the lovely song ' more ' , alongside syl johnson 's daughter , syleena . i thought syleena 's previous efforts were very good . this set is her best yet . i think that syleena 's first two albums were a personal musical education . she has now qualified and is up there with the finest of her generation . the song ' special occasion ' was recommended to me by charles waring , another blues and soul scribe . thank heavens for charles and bill . they keep us , musically , sane . this song has echoes of the deniece williams song ' free ' . ca n't recommend that more highly , could i ? slightly steppers in style with r kelly on board helping out with proceedings . you get the idea i am sure . other real highlights include anthony 's contribution on the lovely melodic ' more ' , as i mentioned . why songs such as this do not grace our pop charts , well is beyond me . a personal belief is that the pop charts ought to carry an animation , or something similar , such as dancers , to accompany the music , which would mean we would be forced to listen to the music and not the male or female models that think they can sing and dance , but can not . far too much lip gloss , cleavage , hairspray , make - up , belly piercing , bling and ponsing around in tights for this old soul fan ........ and the women are just as bad ! lol . oh yes , whilst i do my usual ramble , turn off the t.v. and put on ' time ' from this excellent album . two essential albums . i rest my case m'lud ! both sets are up at amazon , where you can read other folks opinions . i am sure they will concur with bill 's , charles 's and my ' grumble ' opinions . lol . classic soul top of the page � kirk franklin - hero / will downing - soul symphony brown 's bag - labor of love / sparlha swa - in the distance donald mccollum - u do n't want my love / anita baker - christmas fantasy 2006 is going to be a great year for music if these late christmas crackers are anything to go by . kirk franklin 's album ' hero ' i can not recommend more highly . in many parts this album reminds me of tommy sims debut from a few years back . the whole set begins with a plea to help those less privileged in africa . the follow on song samples patrice rushen 's ' have n't you heard ' very cleverly . this is a very spiritual album , highly moving in parts . the title song , featuring one dorinda clark - cole , is very r kelly - esq in a ballad format . lovely harmonies.'could've been me ' is another top drawer dancer , with echoes of benny golson 's ' i 'm always dancing to the music ' . great material . there are further contributions on the gospel front from yolanda adams and marvin winans , however , the real tour de force on this set is a collaboration with stevie wonder on the track ' why ' . this track cleverly utilises deniece william 's song ' free ' . quite why stevie 's album is n't number one on every chart is beyond me . kirk 's set is quite brilliant . every home should have a copy . you can obtain a copy from amazon ( link at the top of the page ) . will downing , if nothing else , is consistent with all of his releases . his warm vocal delivery has been turning on the women out there ever since his debut set nearly 20 years ago . this latest cd is a very mellow set . in fact , there is only one song that could be described as a dancer . that is the stepper song ' soul steppin ' . great tune . will weighs in with his own take on the song ' superstar ' , a track luther made his own back in the day . all of the ballad arrangements are lush and highly song - led on this fine 9 track offering . my favourite song on offer here is the very final track , the gorgeous ' heart of mine ' , a track that will definitely make my year end ' best of ' top 20 . amazon should stock this set as well . a guy called ward brown got in touch with me during december and asked whether i might take a listen to his and his brother ( i guess ) sherrod 's new cd . the guys are illinois based and are similar in style to the kloud 9 brothers soundwise . this is a lovely cd . the guys define themselves as ' defenders of soul ' , and their ' defending ' is of the highest standard . personal highlights are ' things you say ' , the highly harmonic ' love never comes around ' , and the killer track ' heaven ' . that is another track of 2006 , and we are only 4 days into the new year ! well worth picking up a copy from the website below . lovely album . http://www.bushmanentertainment.com/bme/brownsbag/default.asp another artist who contacted me is jamaican born singer sparlha swa . sparlha now is a new york resident . a very different sound to brown 's bag , sparlha 's approach is much more folksy and equally as soulful . the blurb states that her sound has been compared to sade , joan armatrading and tracey chapman . i would n't argue with those comparisons . probably nearer to sade than tracey in my humble opinion . there is something very charming about sparlha 's delivery , with ' sister , sister ' being a personal favourite . this is a very nice album that grows on the listener . great debut . check her website at : www.sparlhaswa.com donald mccollum 's set arrived in just before christmas . another fine release from the excellent people at dome records . donald created a stir earlier last year with the release of the title track from this album on a twelve . that received heavy rotation on the better soul stations here in the u.k. and quite rightly so . bright and breezy and lit up a few dancefloors as well as receiving radio exposure . essential listening . there is a very nice version of william devaughn 's evergreen ' be thankful for what you got ' and , of the original material , ' you 're my everything ' , ' you 're in my arms again ' ( this will please the real soul fraternity ) , ' i wanna love you ' and ' love will come along ' , all really stand out . pretty solid set throughout . recommended . i make no apology in reviewing a christmas album after the recent festivities ! lol . a good friend gave me a copy of this album just after christmas had passed , so it feels strange listening to the set today ( mind you i suppose it is 10th night ) . odd that folks do n't wait until 12th night ( especially if they have kids ) as it seems that christmas is all about getting drunk and material things thesedays , so i guess folks have got what they wanted , so out goes the decorations and get back to the day to day routine . i personally , hate to see the things go . anyhow , the music ! lol . anita baker 's last album was o.k. , however , it did n't break any new ground . the songs were all nice , but i think anita deserved more . that set was beset with technical problems , which meant she had to re - record the whole thing again . there were even lawsuits . when the album was finally released , it sounded a little ' tired ' , understandably . on this set , she sounds a lot happier . the set comprises of many standards the most notable being her take on ' my favourite things ' , which is lovely , and as a friend pointed out to me , can be played all year round . there are 3 original tunes here , all of which are lovely , my favourite being ' family of man ' , which is very much ' caught up in the rapture ' in feel . nice to have anita back on form again . check amazon again for this set . recommended ._. _ _ the cygnus review is a beautiful , 20-page full - colour a4 monthly magazine . it is sent free of charge to all our customers . far more than just a catalogue , we aim to make the cygnus review as enlightening , inspiring and uplifting as possible . as well as reviews of 40 - 50 of the best titles currently available in the mind / body / spirit field , our magazine includes a letter written especially for our readers by a well - known author or special friend . there are also full length features , chosen to inspire and guide . plus we have a noticeboard which includes details of forthcoming events , like - minded holiday venues , psychic services and much more - and there are often special offers on these things exclusively for cygnus members . when the cygnus review drops through your letterbox each month , we hope it will give you a sense of belonging to a huge wave of people who are involved in inner transformation and exploration of alternative , more planet - friendly ways of living and healing . as one cygnus reader , dorothy carlton , put it : ' it is wonderful to feel at one with so many like - minded people ; that in itself builds inner strength .

' forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us . ' the forgiveness of little things and the forgiveness of very great things ; our father 's forgiveness of us and our forgiveness of others . in this chapter we look at the first part of the petition ; god 's forgiveness of us , ' forgive us our sins , our trespasses . ' such a prayer is basic to our spiritual well - being and standing before god . we must first come to our heavenly father , as our lord has taught us , and simply pray , ' forgive us our trespasses . ' what does that actually mean ? for the meaning is slightly hidden by the word ' trespasses ' . ' write off and set us free from our total debt ' , is closer to the greek . but , even so , what is our debt to god our heavenly father ? what debt do we owe to the one in whose hand is our very breath and to whom we owe our very existence ? - we owe him love . he brought us into being for his pleasure , to give him glory in our lives and to enjoy him for ever . we owe him a debt of love , practically expressed in doing what pleases him . - we owe him a willingness to refrain from all that would pollute us before him ; to steer clear of all that we know to be active disobedience or rebellion against him . but , by nature we tend to ignore what god requires , doing what we want and failing to do his will . - our heavenly father has commanded us to love him with all our heart , with all our mind , and with all our strength . but who among us has truly so loved him ? religious words slip easily from our lips , but what of the basic self - centredness of our day by day living ? when king david prayed his great prayer of confession in psalm 32 , he did not say , ' blessed is the man who has not sinned , who has no need of forgiveness , ' but rather , ' blessed is the one whose sin is forgiven , whose debt is paid . ' where , then , does forgiveness begin ? paul the apostle speaks of the disciples at corinth as having been taken from a very grubby world , washed and set apart for god by the cross of our lord . the apostle 's list of the goings - on in that port city of corinth are as ancient as they are modern . greed , theft , drunkenness , violence , perversion and vice are all there . the church at corinth was composed of men and women taken from such a background and yet now , wonderfully , forgiven , adopted and made members of god 's holy family . the apostle paul uses the picture of washing as he describes how they were made clean , made acceptable before our heavenly father . so here , in the great house , are these very practical rooms , wash rooms and bathrooms . we may need to first begin in an outside wash - house , for some of us are as well soiled as a dog that has rolled and besmirched itself in some canine delight that brings no delight to its owner and indeed makes it totally unacceptable in the house . ' a stench in the nostrils of god , ' is exactly how sin , how godless ways are described in the old testament . we may never have so deliberately soiled ourselves , and yet no matter how privileged , how well brought - up , how respectable we may be , when our eyes are opened , each one of us will find ourselves soiled and unacceptable before god . isaiah , the old testament prophet , was both noble and godly and yet , when face to face with the glory and holiness of god , he found himself totally unacceptable , ruined and undone . the memorial stone of the godly and respected local squire in victorian times does not recount his many philanthropic acts of charity , but simply begins with the verse : ' god have mercy upon me a sinner . ' words that reflect his own plea before god and leave a signpost and an encouragement for those who read them today . why do we need forgiveness ? what makes even the most privileged and refined of us totally unacceptable before god ? why are ' all our righteousnesses only as filthy rags ' ? our need of forgiveness is hard for us to see for a number of reasons . for one , if we are not guilty of specific acts like murder , theft or adultery we assume we must be fine . then again , we are so ready and eager to forgive ourselves that we cover over or make a very small matter of any ' slight indiscretion ' before god . why , it was hardly worth noticing and we can always provide a thousand reasons why we really could not help it or why it was not our fault ! the fact is that we stand accused by precisely these deep - seated , self - centred habits of mind and body to which we are , by nature , totally blind . at rock bottom , we need forgiveness because we live in god 's world as if there were no god . perhaps not in the great crises of life or when we desperately needed something , but by and large we ignore the god in whose hand is our breath . in the words of the lord 's prayer , we have failed to honour him , failed to seek first his kingdom and right ways , failed to do his will , much preferring to do our own will . we have also failed to love those around us in the way in which we love ourselves . these are the selfish , god - ignoring ways that the bible calls sin , a stench , and that cause us to be totally unacceptable before him and so in desperate need of mercy and forgiveness . the true sons and daughters of god are like street children taken from the filth , violence and vice of the city and adopted into a royal household . the first step is a complete wash and change of clothes . here is mercy ; here is the forgiveness of god , here we are given a fresh new start . thereafter begins the very gradual , faltering process of a total change in the basis of our thinking and acting . we slowly learn to love the lord who made us acceptable and adopted us into his family . we begin to long to please him ; to put god , rather than ourselves , at the centre . god our heavenly father has made it wonderfully possible for us , modern disciples , to be made acceptable before him . no matter how soiled , we , too , may be made sons and daughters of the living god on the basis of mercy and forgiveness . our father is more willing to forgive than we are willing either to admit our need of forgiveness and humbly ask for it or to accept it when it is freely given . ' heavenly father , forgive us our trespasses , have mercy on us , write off our debts once and for all , put us right with yourself . may we , like the ancient corinthian christians , be washed and made acceptable before you . ' this is the first , great and primary application of these words . we will often need to return to confess and wash away the grime of real , everyday living in this world as a child of god , but never again for the radical treatment that first brought us into the household . ongoing , day by day forgiveness as adopted members of our father 's family , we shall want to leave each day 's mud behind as we enter the house . both boot room and washroom are rooms of repentance and confession , rooms of cleansing and forgiveness . they give us a moment to reflect on the day : ' father these are the opportunities that i missed to serve you , to honour you , to speak for you , to love my neighbour . these are the things i have failed to do . these are the things that i did in haste , anger . . . or in foolishness . ' scripture urges us not to hide or cover them over , not to belittle them as being of very minor importance , but to come openly to our heavenly father . such prayers are no longer in terms of our acceptability before him , our place in the family of god , but rather in terms of our walking with him at ease and in the joy of a right relationship . if we pray it aright , the wonder of the lord 's prayer - and , indeed , the wonder of all true christian living - is that it will reform us , it will change us . sadly , there is a lot of religious activity about which does not change us at all . we go and do certain things in a compartment of our lives we call ' worship ' ; it may be with colour and candles and beautiful , traditional music , or it may be with stirring , modern music , shining faces and uplifted arms . we enjoy it , it moves us at the time but it does not change us , does not touch the rest of our lives . we go on living exactly as we had done before . but , for example , if we really pray the lord 's prayer from the heart it will change us . we will find forgiveness in christ . we will find that as we bring our trespasses day by day before god , our conscience will be awakened and sharpened . we will be more aware of our father giving us opportunities to serve him and also of the opportunities we miss . we will begin to be aware of those things that do not bring honour to his name , even before we do them . we will begin to long not to do them . by the grace of god and the prompting of his holy spirit , we will be changed . this gradual changing is the purpose of god for each disciple ; that we might be more christ - like . hence this prayer , ' forgive us our sins , our trespasses , ' will need to be often on our lips if we are to grow as disciples . our communal failings like all these petitions , the prayer for forgiveness is set in the lord 's prayer in the plural . although our heavenly father chooses to deal with us one by one , we are set in communities . like a stone thrown into a pond , we begin with personal confession , but the ripples move out to affect the whole surface . as we really begin to pray we will look beyond our own personal standing and walk before god . we will begin to see and acknowledge our collective responsibilities and failings before our heavenly father . for example : - we live in a land that has been so blessed of god . he has had such patience with us and yet , as a people , we are turning away from him , ignoring him at every level . we cling to our materialistic lifestyle and forget the god in whose hand is our very existence . . . ' father forgive our wilful forgetfulness of your goodness and turn us again , as a people , to godly ways . ' - we live in a land that has been the centre of an empire . we need to look afresh at our national pride and arrogance , at our deeply held community attitudes to those of other races and cultures and at our collective ' blind eye ' to the commercial exploitation of those who produce the goods we buy so cheaply . . . - we are part of a society that has become greedy and unconcerned in its use and abuse of the environment . . . ' father forgive . . . ' - god has given the historic churches of our land very great privileges and very great spiritual responsibilities . by and large we have enjoyed the privileges and failed in our great responsibility to uphold godly ways and win the people of our land for the lord . . . ' father forgive the coldness , formality and absorbing self - interest of our churches and kindle afresh courage , love and vision . ' - finally , and so significantly , we live in a society in which so many people now place the bringing up of children , and particularly their spiritual welfare , well down the list of priorities , well below the pursuit of their own career or of personal happiness . but before god the family has a far greater priority . & nbspour families are the basic building blocks of community living and of a godly society ; the seedbed of love and stability . they are given to be the royal nursery of the rising generation . they can also be the guest rooms for godly hospitality . our homes are the setting where godly love can be shown to our neighbour and where justice , compassion , forgiveness and faithfulness can be learned and practised by parents and children together . & nbspin our pursuit of wealth and personal happiness , we so easily forget that our heavenly father 's priority is the raising of godly offspring . the debt we owe is to use our homes for the lord ; especially to do all in our power to faithfully bring up the youngsters he has entrusted to us to know and honour the lord . . . ' father , forgive us . . . ' as a land , as a church , as a society and as individuals we have fallen so far short . ' father have mercy , forgive us our neglect , our failure , our trespasses .

who are aggressive , anti - social and apparently unmotivated . the book also describes the results of a systematic attempt to evaluate the work of the centre through studies of mental health outcomes and the use made of it by the young people with whom it engages . in his introduction geoffrey baruch presents the centre 's perspective on adolescence and identifies the evidence for the increased prevalence of psychosocial disorders in this group . the particular characteristics of the brandon centre 's referred population are identified in the context of the factors that have influenced the delivery of psychotherapy : multiple problems , variety of ages and stages of development , motivation or otherwise for treatment and ethnic minority status . thereafter , the book is divided into three sections : theoretical and practical aspects of engaging young people in treatment , services for high priority groups , and thirdly , evaluation . in the first section there are chapters which explore issues such as time limited intervention , therapeutic contact following psychotic breakdown , and engaging with adolescents whose capacity to think and reflect about themselves is impaired . the second addresses issues such as working with bereavement andworking with young people from ethnic minority backgrounds . there are two other chapters where work has been undertaken in the more exposed settings of special schools - one for children with severe physical difficulties and one for those with emotional and behavioural difficulties . the point is strongly made that the centre 's ongoing programme of the evaluation informs all aspects of its practice . this is most clearly demonstrated in a chapter on treatment of severe anti - social behaviour and the final section on the methodology of evaluation and identification of outcomes . my immediate impression is how many issues addressed are common to all mental health disciplines . in particular the need to develop and adapt our accepted strategies of intervention to meet the challenges of an adolescent population whose childhood experience has been framed by a huge tv channel expansion , niche marketing and increased family fragmentation . secondly , the need for us all to gain clarity about the impact of our interventions . alongside this i was reminded of the huge contribution that psychotherapy makes to focus our attention uncompromisingly on the internal world of the young person and the meanings and narratives they construct . this is enormously important and educative for those of us constantly under pressure to manage the externals of behaviour in the face of scant acknowledgement of the specific and unique meanings which this has to each individual . the contributors vary in their detailed depiction of these internal worlds . the most concentrated in this respect is the excellent chapter by suzanne blundell on working with bereaved adolescents . each case history presents outcomes in terms of internal and external changes . she has some honest reflections on dealing with adolescents from different cultures who have suffered serious war traumas , signalling the greater potential of group therapy . rajinder bains 's chapter addresses the complexities that arise when young people come from ethnic minority backgrounds and the task of accommodating to two cultures when the process of engagement with psychotherapy in itself carries strong meanings in terms of accommodating to the dominant culture . there is a revealing discussion of the perceived experience of racism and the difficult task of distinguishing between responses which are functionally appropriate as opposed to dysfunctional defences . the chapters from caroline essenhigh and david trevatt vividly describe the additional issues brought about by working in another institution ( a special school ) with its own dominant agendas : the need to clarify roles , the meanings for the adolescent of the therapeutic work and the perceptions of other students , the tyranny of the school timetable . i identified strongly with essenhigh 's jubilation at the mere fact of keeping one particular student in the room ! i wondered how the therapist 's anxiety about how to manage the process within the acceptable constraints of the school culture might have impacted on her therapeutic engagement with the young person . she also reflects on the group processes which operate at student and staff level as institutional defences and correctly identifies the need for consultation to the special school as an institution as an essential prerequisite for ebd schools to be effective . one of the most stimulating chapters is by charles wells on the treatment of severe anti - social beavhiour in young people . this has emerged from the need to match therapeutic approach with the level of development and cognitive capacity of the adolescent . the conduct disordered 13 to 16 year - old group is the most likely to drop out of psychotherapy . the centre has accordingly modified an american programme which uses a cognitive behavioural approach that targets problem solving , social skills and social perspective taking . a randomised controlled trial is underway which compares outcomes of this programme with one which involves more generalised supportive counselling . frustratingly , there is a further year to run before the impact of the programme can be evaluated . if positive , the implications for intervention with this group could be considerable . the final section of the book reports the outcomes of treatment as identified through self report and report by a ' significant other ' a year after contact with the centre commenced . the most positive impact is on problems which are internalised rather than extemalised and of older rather than younger adolescents . this book will prove relevant to all those involved in child and adolescent mental health . the overriding impression i am left with is of a discipline struggling to connect with the accountability it has to those that fund it and to the community at large . in this respect , it provides a model for us all . roger booker roger booker is head of educational psychology service , surrey county council buy community -

user interface to the telnet protocol synopsis telnet [ -8efklacdfrx ] [ -x authtype ] [ -b hostalias ] [ -e escapechar ] [ -k realm ] [ -l user ] [ -n tracefile ] [ host [ port ] ] description the telnet command is used to communicate with another host using the telnet protocol . if telnet is invoked without the host argument , it enters command mode , indicated by its prompt ( telnet > ) . in this mode , it accepts and executes the commands listed below . if it is invoked with arguments , it performs an open command with those arguments . the options are as follows : -8 specifies an 8-bit data path . this causes an attempt to negoti- ate the telnet binary option on both input and output . -e stops any character from being recognized as an escape character . -f if kerberos v5 authentication is being used , the -f option allows the local credentials to be forwarded to the remote system , including any credentials that have already been forwarded into the local environment . -k specifies no automatic login to the remote system . -l specifies an 8-bit data path on output . this causes the binary option to be negotiated on output . -x atype disables the atype type of authentication . -a attempt automatic login . currently , this sends the user name via the user variable of the environ option if supported by the remote system . the name used is that of the current user as returned by getlogin(2 ) if it agrees with the current user id , otherwise it is the name associated with the user id . -b hostalias uses bind(2 ) on the local socket to bind it to an aliased address ( see ifconfig(8 ) and the `` alias '' specifier ) or to the address of another interface than the one naturally chosen by connect(2 ) . this can be useful when connecting to services which use ip addresses for authentication and reconfiguration of the server is undesirable ( or impossible ) . -c disables the reading of the user 's .telnetrc file . ( see the toggle skiprc command on this man page . ) -d sets the initial value of the debug toggle to true . -e escapechar sets the initial telnet escape character to escapechar . if escapechar is omitted , then there will be no escape character . -f if kerberos v5 authentication is being used , the -f option allows the local credentials to be forwarded to the remote system . -k realm if kerberos authentication is being used , the -k option requests that telnet obtain tickets for the remote host in realm realm instead of the remote host 's realm , as determined by krb ) . -l user when connecting to the remote system , if the remote system under- stands the environ option , then user will be sent to the remote system as the value for the variable user . this option implies the -a option . this option may also be used with the open com- mand . -n tracefile opens tracefile for recording trace information . see the set tracefile command below . -r specifies a user interface similar to rlogin(1 ) . in this mode , the escape character is set to the tilde ( ~ ) character , unless modified by the -e option . -x turns on encryption of the data stream if possible . host indicates the official name , an alias , or the internet address of a remote host . port indicates a port number ( address of an application ) . if a number is not specified , the default telnet port is used . when in rlogin mode , a line of the form ~. disconnects from the remote host ; ~ is the telnet escape character . similarly , the line ~^z suspends the telnet session . the line ~^ ] escapes to the normal telnet escape prompt . once a connection has been opened , telnet will attempt to enable the telnet linemode option . if this fails , telnet will revert to one of two input modes : either `` character at a time '' or `` old line by line '' depending on what the remote system supports . when linemode is enabled , character processing is done on the local sys- tem , under the control of the remote system . when input editing or char- acter echoing is to be disabled , the remote system will relay that infor- mation . the remote system will also relay changes to any special charac- ters that happen on the remote system , so that they can take effect on the local system . in `` character at a time '' mode , most text typed is immediately sent to the remote host for processing . in `` old line by line '' mode , all text is echoed locally , and ( normally ) only completed lines are sent to the remote host . the `` local echo char- acter '' ( initially `` ^e '' ) may be used to turn off and on the local echo ( this would mostly be used to enter passwords without the password being echoed ) . if the linemode option is enabled , or if the localchars toggle is true ( the default for `` old line by line '' ; see below ) , the user 's quit , intr , and flush characters are trapped locally , and sent as telnet protocol sequences to the remote side . if linemode has ever been enabled , then the user 's susp and eof are also sent as telnet protocol sequences , and quit is sent as a telnet abort instead of break . there are options ( see toggle autoflush and toggle autosynch below ) which cause this action to flush subsequent output to the terminal ( until the remote host acknowl- edges the telnet sequence ) and flush previous terminal input ( in the case of quit and intr ) . while connected to a remote host , telnet command mode may be entered by typing the telnet `` escape character '' ( initially `` ^ ] '' ) . when in com- mand mode , the normal terminal editing conventions are available . note that the escape character will return to the command mode of the initial invocation of telnet that has the controlling terminal . use the send escape command to switch to command mode in subsequent telnet processes on remote hosts . the following telnet commands are available . only enough of each command to uniquely identify it need be typed ( this is also true for arguments to the mode , set , toggle , unset , slc , environ , and display commands ) . auth argument [ ... ] the auth command manipulates the information sent through the telnet authenticate option . valid arguments for the auth com- mand are as follows : disable type disables the specified type of authentication . to obtain a list of available types , use the auth disable ? command . enable type enables the specified type of authentication . to obtain a list of available types , use the auth enable ? command . status lists the current status of the various types of authentication . close close a telnet session and return to command mode . display argument [ ... ] displays all , or some , of the set and toggle values ( see below ) . encrypt argument [ ... ] the encrypt command manipulates the information sent through the telnet encrypt option . valid arguments for the encrypt command are as follows : disable type [ input|output ] disables the specified type of encryption . if you omit input and output , both input and output are disabled . to obtain a list of available types , use the encrypt disable ? command . enable type [ input|output ] enables the specified type of encryption . if you omit input and output , both input and output are enabled . to obtain a list of available types , use the encrypt enable ? command . input this is the same as the encrypt start input com- mand . -input this is the same as the encrypt stop input com- mand . output this is the same as the encrypt start output command . -output this is the same as the encrypt stop output com- mand . start [ input|output ] attempts to start encryption . if you omit input and output , both input and output are enabled . to obtain a list of available types , use the encrypt enable ? command . status lists the current status of encryption . stop [ input|output ] stops encryption . if you omit input and output , encryption is on both input and output . type type sets the default type of encryption to be used with later encrypt start or encrypt stop com- mands . environ arguments [ ... ] the environ command is used to manipulate the variables that may be sent through the telnet environ option . the initial set of variables is taken from the users environment , with only the display and printer variables being exported by default . the user variable is also exported if the -a or -l options are used . valid arguments for the environ command are : define variable value define the variable variable to have a value of value . any variables defined by this command are automatically exported . the value may be enclosed in single or double quotes so that tabs and spaces may be included . undefine variable remove variable from the list of environment vari- ables . export variable mark the variable variable to be exported to the remote side . unexport variable mark the variable variable to not be exported unless explicitly asked for by the remote side . list list the current set of environment variables . those marked with a * will be sent automatically , other variables will only be sent if explicitly requested . ? prints out help information for the environ com- mand . logout sends the telnet logout option to the remote side . this com- mand is similar to a close command ; however , if the remote side does not support the logout option , nothing happens . if , however , the remote side does support the logout option , this command should cause the remote side to close the telnet con- nection . if the remote side also supports the concept of sus- pending a user 's session for later reattachment , the logout argument indicates that you should terminate the session imme- diately . mode type type is one of several options , depending on the state of the telnet session . the remote host is asked for permission to go into the requested mode . if the remote host is capable of entering that mode , the requested mode will be entered . character disable the telnet linemode option , or , if the remote side does not understand the linemode option , then enter `` character at a time '' mode . line enable the telnet linemode option , or , if the remote side does not understand the linemode option , then attempt to enter `` old - line - by- line '' mode . isig ( -isig ) attempt to enable ( disable ) the trapsig mode of the linemode option . this requires that the linemode option be enabled . edit ( -edit ) attempt to enable ( disable ) the edit mode of the linemode option . this requires that the linemode option be enabled . softtabs ( -softtabs ) attempt to enable ( disable ) the soft mode of the linemode option . this requires that the linemode option be enabled . litecho ( -litecho ) attempt to enable ( disable ) the lit mode of the linemode option . this requires that the linemode option be enabled . ? prints out help information for the mode com- mand . open host [ -l user ] [ [ - ] port ] open a connection to the named host . if no port number is specified , telnet will attempt to contact a telnet server at the default port . the host specification may be either a host name ( see hosts(5 ) ) or an internet address specified in the `` dot notation '' ( see inet(3 ) ) . the -l option may be used to specify the user name to be passed to the remote system via the environ option . when connecting to a non - standard port , telnet omits any automatic initiation of telnet options . when the port number is preceded by a minus sign , the initial option negotiation is done . after establishing a connection , the file .telnetrc in the user 's home directory is opened . lines beginning with a `` # '' are comment lines . blank lines are ignored . lines that begin without whitespace are the start of a machine entry . the first thing on the line is the name of the machine that is being connected to . the rest of the line , and successive lines that begin with whitespace are assumed to be telnet commands and are processed as if they had been typed in manually to the telnet command prompt . quit close any open telnet session and exit telnet . an end - of - file ( in command mode ) will also close a session and exit . send arguments sends one or more special character sequences to the remote host . the following are the arguments which may be specified ( more than one argument may be specified at a time ) : abort sends the telnet abort ( abort processes ) sequence . ao sends the telnet ao ( abort output ) sequence , which should cause the remote system to flush all output from the remote system to the user 's terminal . ayt sends the telnet ayt ( are you there ) sequence , to which the remote system may or may not choose to respond . brk sends the telnet brk ( break ) sequence , which may have significance to the remote system . ec sends the telnet ec ( erase character ) sequence , which should cause the remote system to erase the last char- acter entered . el sends the telnet el ( erase line ) sequence , which should cause the remote system to erase the line cur- rently being entered . eof sends the telnet eof ( end of file ) sequence . eor sends the telnet eor ( end of record ) sequence . escape sends the current telnet escape character ( initially `` ^ ] '' ) . ga sends the telnet ga ( go ahead ) sequence , which likely has no significance to the remote system . getstatus if the remote side supports the telnet status command , getstatus will send the subnegotiation to request that the server send its current option status . ip sends the telnet ip ( interrupt process ) sequence , which should cause the remote system to abort the cur- rently running process . nop sends the telnet nop ( no operation ) sequence . susp sends the telnet susp ( suspend process ) sequence . synch sends the telnet synch sequence . this sequence causes the remote system to discard all previously typed ( but not yet read ) input . this sequence is sent as tcp urgent data ( and may not work if the remote system is a 4.2bsd system -- if it does n't work , a lower case `` r '' may be echoed on the terminal ) . do cmd sends the telnet do cmd sequence . cmd can be either a decimal number between 0 and 255 , or a symbolic name for a specific telnet command . cmd can also be either help or ?

to print out help information , including a list of known symbolic names . ? prints out help information for the send command . set argument value unset argument value the set command will set any one of a number of telnet vari- ables to a specific value or to true . the special value off turns off the function associated with the variable ; this is equivalent to using the unset command . the unset command will disable or set to false any of the specified functions . the values of variables may be interrogated with the display com- mand . the variables which may be set or unset , but not tog- gled , are listed here . in addition , any of the variables for the toggle command may be explicitly set or unset using the set and unset commands . ayt if telnet is in localchars mode , or linemode is enabled , and the status character is typed , a telnet ayt sequence ( see send ayt preceding ) is sent to the remote host . the initial value for the " are you there " character is the terminal 's status character . echo this is the value ( initially `` ^e '' ) which , when in `` line by line '' mode , toggles between doing local echoing of entered characters ( for normal processing ) , and suppressing echoing of entered characters ( for entering , say , a password ) . eof if telnet is operating in linemode or `` old line by line '' mode , entering this character as the first character on a line will cause this character to be sent to the remote system . the initial value of the eof character is taken to be the terminal 's eof char- acter . erase if telnet is in localchars mode ( see toggle localchars below ) , and if telnet is operating in `` character at a time '' mode , then when this character is typed , a telnet ec sequence ( see send ec above ) is sent to the remote system . the initial value for the erase char- acter is taken to be the terminal 's erase character . escape this is the telnet escape character ( initially `` ^ [ '' ) which causes entry into telnet command mode ( when con- nected to a remote system ) . flushoutput if telnet is in localchars mode ( see toggle localchars below ) and the flushoutput character is typed , a telnet ao sequence ( see send ao above ) is sent to the remote host . the initial value for the flush charac- ter is taken to be the terminal 's flush character . forw1 forw2 if telnet is operating in linemode , these are the characters that , when typed , cause partial lines to be forwarded to the remote system . the initial value for the forwarding characters are taken from the termi- nal 's eol and eol2 characters . interrupt if telnet is in localchars mode ( see toggle localchars below ) and the interrupt character is typed , a telnet ip sequence ( see send ip above ) is sent to the remote host . the initial value for the interrupt character is taken to be the terminal 's intr character . kill if telnet is in localchars mode ( see toggle localchars below ) , and if telnet is operating in `` character at a time '' mode , then when this character is typed , a telnet el sequence ( see send el above ) is sent to the remote system . the initial value for the kill charac- ter is taken to be the terminal 's kill character . lnext if telnet is operating in linemode or `` old line by line '' mode , then this character is taken to be the terminal 's lnext character . the initial value for the lnext character is taken to be the terminal 's lnext character . quit if telnet is in localchars mode ( see toggle localchars below ) and the quit character is typed , a telnet brk sequence ( see send brk above ) is sent to the remote host . the initial value for the quit character is taken to be the terminal 's quit character . reprint if telnet is operating in linemode or old line by line '' mode , then this character is taken to be the terminal 's reprint character . the initial value for the reprint character is taken to be the terminal 's reprint character . rlogin this is the rlogin escape character . if set , the nor- mal telnet escape character is ignored unless it is preceded by this character at the beginning of a line . this character , at the beginning of a line , followed by a " .

displays the legal toggle commands . z suspend telnet . this command only works when the user is using the csh(1 ) . ! [ command ] execute a single command in a subshell on the local system . if command is omitted , then an interactive subshell is invoked . ? [ command ] get help . with no arguments , telnet prints a help summary . if a command is specified , telnet will print the help informa- tion for just that command . environment telnet uses at least the home , shell , display , and term environment vari- ables . other environment variables may be propagated to the other side via the telnet environ option . files ~/.telnetrc user customized telnet startup values history the telnet command appeared in 4.2bsd . notes on some remote systems , echo has to be turned off manually when in `` old line by line '' mode . in `` old line by line '' mode or linemode the terminal 's eof character is only recognized ( and sent to the remote system ) when it is the first character on a line . source routing is not supported yet for ipv6 . bsd february 3 , 1994 bsd � 1994 man -

to enjoy today but with greater care for how we impact on the world our children and grandchildren will inherit . reducing waste is one obvious test for all of us . mineral - based industries like cement face particular challenges because , in satisfying the needs that we as individuals generate , they consume precious reserves of raw materials . cement - making also necessitates the burning of fossil fuels which , with the raw materials themselves , then create emissions to the atmosphere . internationally , the cement industry is taking a lead in addressing this through its agenda for action and also through its commitment to restoration of former operating sites . the uk cement industry set up a sustainable development task force to demonstrate its continually improving performance and further its reputation as a sound , sustainable and transparent industry . at the same time , cement makes a massive contribution to sustaining the quality of life . without the concrete and mortar we make from it , we would have no homes , schools or hospitals . there would be no roads for our vehicles , no runways for our aircraft and no reservoirs to store our water . it also sustains people by creating many thousands of jobs ._. _ _ a t -

day old copy . if you made a mess with your working copy and its backup , you can return to this one . archive and backup there is a distinct difference between archiving data and backing it up , and this is reflected in the different hardware and software used to implement each . archive long - term storage ; keeping a complete set of data for historical reasons . backup short to medium term storage ; storing those parts of a set of data that have changed , for disaster recovery reasons . archiving the usual sort of thing that should be archived is something like a book or thesis . the media on which the original document was stored during its composition may have a short lifetime . either it will fail , or someone will erase it . there is no compulsion on other people to look after any of your documents , especially if you are no longer part of their group . archive media should either have a long shelf life , or more than one copy can be stored on less reliable media . examples of archive systems cd - rom and dvd - rom . standard media which are likely to be readable on future systems . they can not be erased by magnetic fields and are tolerant of dust . however , damage can occur by severe scratching , and the incorrect use of cd writing software . use good quality media , and avoid the use of certain inks which may destroy the disk . paper . if the data lends itself to being printed on paper , this is a reliable method if stored correctly . paper takes up a lot of space , is likely to deteriorate and can be damaged by water and fire . further editing by computer is most inconvenient , requiring scanning and proof reading of the scanned results . heirarchical file server ( hfs ) . the university 's hfs system can archive data as well as providing for backup , but special permission needs to be granted . multiple " less reliable systems " , such as two sets of floppy disks and a hard disk . especially effective if the systems are different and stored in different places . the danger is that all the systems may fail over time . backup the fundamental ' backup ' is frequent saving . do not work on a document for hours before saving it - software , hardware , and mains supplies are not that reliable ! save and name your document at the time of its creation , then click on the save button every five minutes or so . the exact time between clicks of the save button depends on how much you like retyping ! the word " backup " earlier on in the previous paragraph is in inverted commas because this does not really describe a backup in the true sense ; if your machine was to be switched off , you would not have a secondary copy . a danger of frequent saving with no backup is that you save a new version over the old each time . if your latest version of the document was corrupted it would overwrite the good version on disk . examples of backup systems floppy disks . these ubiquitous items hold 1.44 mb of data , but they do not have a very long life . they are highly susceptible to dust and magnetic fields . data stored on floppy disk may last for five years , but a disk may fail within months if stored in the wrong environment or up to ten years if looked after . secondary hard disks . a physically separate hard disk from your main working hard disk , either an internal disk or an external disk in an enclosure connected by usb or firewire . much more reliable than floppy disks or zip disks as they are sealed from the environment . they mainly fail due to being subject to mechanical shock , especially when they are in use . zip drives and other removable disks . good for transporting and storing larger amounts of data . reliability similar to floppy disks , or perhaps a bit better . for large documents and pictures , and for moving data between home and work . memory sticks . not really designed for backup , except for the very short term . can be easily erased , and are mainly useful for moving data between home and work . network shares e.g. " the p : drive " . the advantage of using network drives it that the drive is on a completely separate machine , perhaps in another room , reducing the points of failure for your data . also the server serving the network share will usually have nightly backup giving a third failsafe for your data . tape backup systems . usually attached to servers , although they are available for virtually any mainstream computer . they usually require , and come with , specialised backup software . the computer in question is left on and the software will schedule automatic backup . this will be one of two kinds : full and incremental , where the incremental backup saves only files that have changed since the last backup . tape backup should be used in addition to the normal safeguards of saving frequently during the day . a backup strategy should normally be employed to rotate tapes and provide a selection of data from previous days and weeks . see the section below . heirarchical file server ( hfs ) . the university 's hfs system will provide automatic weekly backup for those systems which are registered with it . if a good case is made , automatic backup can occur every night . manual backups can , in any case , be made at any time using the software supplied . the 32-bit windows software is available for installation from the physiology file server . a backup strategy an example of simple backing up using a single computer is : keep your working copy of a document on a computer 's hard disk . frequently save it , while less frequently making a copy onto other media ( not another directory or partition on the same hard disk ) . you may also wish to make an even less frequent copy with a different name in case you wish to return to it . for example , if i am going to make changes to a working program or printed document , i will make sure i have a copy of the ' released ' document before starting my major changes to the next revision . this sort of thing can be achieved automatically by using revision control software - unix users have " rcs " available to them . an example of a professional backup strategy : computer users should look after their own data by saving and backing up frequently during the day . do nightly incremental backups : use a tape drive or similar system , and buy a set of media from a reputable manufacturer . rotate your tapes or disks nightly . an example system using nine tapes would be : saturday tape six backup everything on primary hard disk . sunday tape seven backup everything on secondary hard disk . monday tape one incremental backup of files that changed during monday . tuesday tape two incremental backup of files that changed during tuesday . wednesday tape three incremental backup of files that changed during wednesday . thursday tape four incremental backup of files that changed during thursday . friday tape five incremental backup of files that changed during friday . saturday tape eight backup everything on primary hard disk . sunday tape nine backup everything on secondary hard disk . monday tape one incremental backup of files that changed during monday . tuesday tape two incremental backup of files that changed during tuesday . wednesday tape three incremental backup of files that changed during wednesday . thursday tape four incremental backup of files that changed during thursday . friday tape five incremental backup of files that changed during friday . saturday tape six backup everything on primary hard disk . sunday tape seven backup everything on secondary hard disk . and so on .. this page is maintained by tim pragnell . it was last modified on : monday 15-nov-2004_cd _ _ for the first time ever i visited rome this weekend . it was no holiday but it was a great pleasure . the world president of the red cross/ red crescent dr massimo barra had asked me to speak on a high level conference on a new international drugs policy on friday . the organisation is much bigger and more powerful than i thought . it has 97 million members and volunteers world - wide and forty countries attended . it was wonderful to hear of the practical innovative policies pursued by this organisation in reducing drug harm . their founding motto is to ' use the knowledge of science and warmth of human compassion � . a progressive resolution was passed . on saturday delegates visited the huge rome red cross centre the villa mariani . among the unexpected possessions they have is mussolini 's ambulance . we also saw an impressive exercise preparing forthe aftermath of an earthquake . but the main function of villa mariani is to provide a place of refuge for rome 's drug users . working in collaboration with the police , the service is humane , intelligent and practical . in the evening the events of the day were discussed at a dinner in rome 's magnificent city hall in the company of radical mep and ex - euro commissioner emma bonino and the archbishop of bucharest . below is the speech given to representatives of the red cross about harm reduction in my role as rapporteur to the council of europe on the motion entitled ' for a european convention on the promotion of public health measures in the fight against drugs ' . the full text of the resolution can be foundbelow the speech . � hiv / aids has killed more than 20 million people worldwide � 40 million people worldwide are currently infected � in 2004 , approximately five million people were newly infected with the virus . � in 2004 , 3.1 million people died of aids - related illnesses , equating to 8,500 people each day � 510,000 of those aids - related deaths in 2004 , were children under the age of 15 � more than 13 million children under the age of 15 have been orphaned by hiv / aids , and this number is projected to double by 2010 � in europe as a whole , 80 % of hiv cases with a known route of transmission are due to injecting drug use . � in russia , up to 90 % of registered hiv infections have been officially attributed to injecting drug use . � in ukraine , between 1996 and 2003 , aids incidence increased from 3 to 37 cases per million and has now surpassed the western european average . in june of this year , the social health and family affairs committee of the council of europe voted to adopt an initiative presented to it by the senlis council . at its core , the initiative aims to integrate considerations of public health with considerations concerning drug policy formulation . the initiative is currently being taken forward in the council of europe in the form of a resolution for which i have been appointed rapporteur . the resolution is entitled , � for a european convention on the promotion of public health measures in the fight against drugs ' . it aims at the eventual adoption of a legal convention by member states ' governments , which codifies effective public health responses to problematic drug use . in recognition of the urgency of this initiative , a draft convention has already been formulated , entitled � a framework convention on public health promotion ' . next month , the resolution , together with the draft convention which it proposes , shall be presented to the social health and family affairs committee for further detailed deliberation , before being presented to the committee of ministers at the council of europe in strasbourg . the foundation stone of this council of europe initiative derives from a fundamental human right ; the right to health . this right was first enshrined in the 1946 constitution of the who , providing that : the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race , religion , political belief , economic or social condition . two years later , the universal declaration of human rights laid the foundations for the international legal framework for the right to health . the right to health has since been codified in numerous international and regional human rights treaties , including the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights which provides the cornerstone protection of the right to health in international law , introducing legally binding provisions applicable to all individuals in the 146 ratifying states . the right to health extends not only to the availability of health care , but also to the underlying determinants of health , such as access to a healthy environment , and access to health - related education and information . it confers freedoms � such as the right to control one 's health , as well as entitlements � such as the right to a system of health protection that provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health . the council of europe convention that is being proposed aims to forge public health considerations with drug policy formulation . it has three inter - related objectives:- to promote , as a fundamental human right , the right to health in the context of drug abuse . to clarify the scope of the right to health as it applies to drug abuse . to help identify good practices for the operation of the right to health as it applies to drug abuse , at the community , national and international levels . since the late 1960s , the public health imperative has become a major impetus for pragmatic drug policy - making in many european countries . the public health driven drug policies of many european countries have given rise to a wide socio - medical literature on responses to drug abuse and addiction . many governments are now equipped with a more informed understanding and the key responses that have emerged are needle exchange programmes , substitution treatment , and safe injection sites . the motion for a resolution that was passed at the council of europe last june constituted a firm indication of the social health and family affairs committee 's support for these key responses . there is now an abundance of scientific evidence from around the world that easier access to needles and syringes can have a direct impact on reducing hiv transmission rates . these results are widely documented and underpin the committee 's recognition of the urgent need to consolidate and articulate these evidenced - based public health measures in an international legal framework . it is anticipated that this , in turn , will pave the way for further empirical and scientific analysis of drug usage and risks , and facilitate information sharing between countries leading to improved best practices . whereas , twenty years ago , such measures were still at an experimental stage , it is clear that they have now reached maturity . the draft convention consolidates the socio - medical knowledge concerning these responses that has evolved in past years and codifies this knowledge in a framework of best practices of drug policy responses . it recognises , for example , the importance of outreach work as well as of providing easy access , low threshold services in order to maximise the access and retention of all drug abusers . crucially too , it urges the integration of drug policy responses with other healthcare and social services , especially those services targeting marginalised and socially disadvantaged groups . this can make an ongoing commitment to public health measures more likely and can have a marked effect on the successful long - term rehabilitation of drug users and their reintegration into society . the resultant benefits may be felt by society as a whole , through reductions in the incidence of criminal behaviour , reduced costs for health and criminal justice systems , reduced risks of transmission of hiv and other blood borne viruses , increased productivity and ultimately reduced drug use levels . evidenced - based drug responses are , however , woefully inadequate in scale and coverage globally and the growing hiv / aids pandemic has given this public health imperative a renewed urgency . the 6th united nations millennium development goal sends a call to � halt and begin to reverse the spread of hiv / aids � . in eastern europe , rising incidences of opiate abuse are reported alongside rates of hiv / aids infection which are the fastest growing in the world . in 2004 , 210,000 new infections were recorded - bringing the total number of hiv - positive people in the region to approximately 1.4 million . as the threat of the spread of blood - borne diseases such as hepatitis c and hiv / aids linked to intravenous drug use rises , there is an overwhelming need for a clear signal from the international community that gives legal credibility to public health responses and that encourages countries to create the right conditions in which the dignity of vulnerable drug users may be restored . in some central european countries , where evidenced - based hiv interventions have , to varying degrees , been adopted , hiv epidemics have been controlled or averted . in poland , by mounting a strong national response , including targeting interventions at injecting drug users , the government successfully contained the epidemic among injecting drug users and , to date , have averted more widespread epidemics in non - injecting populations . in the czech and slovak republics and slovenia , well - designed national hiv / aids programmes are thought to have contributed to low prevalence among idus and low incidence in non - injecting populations . the current un drug conventions regime provides a broad mandate for the implementation of public health responses . the primary aims of the conventions include preventing and combating abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and addressing the health and social problems which such abuse engenders . to achieve these ends , the initiative now under discussion in the council of europe seeks to incorporate the current state of socio - medical knowledge in the formulation of drug policy responses . in so doing , the council of europe initiative sets out to create a new paradigm , enabling states to formulate public - health orientated responses to global trends and structural forces . it is clear that the promotion of public health responses to drug abuse is not the exclusive responsibility of the council of europe . today 's seminar offers an invaluable opportunity to re - emphasize the public health imperative amongst other key organizations represented here today . the support and actions taken by such organizations as those present today will play a vital part in stimulating the political momentum required to bring about much needed change in drug policy responses . for a european drug convention on promoting public health policy in drug control motion for a resolution presented by mr flynn and others the public health imperative has become a major impetus for drug policy - making in many european countries . key responses to the problems of drug abuse have emerged , most notably : needle exchange programmes , and substitution / maintenance treatment . where these responses have been implemented as integral to a country 's overall drug prevention and treatment policies , especially those services targeting marginalised and socially disadvantaged groups , this has had a marked effect on the successful long - term rehabilitation of drug users and their reintegration into society . the resultant benefits are felt by society as a whole , through reductions in the incidence of criminal behaviour , reduced costs for health and criminal justice systems , reduced risks of transmission of hiv and other blood borne viruses , increased productivity and ultimately reduced drug use levels . the growing hiv / aids pandemic is in many countries chiefly attributable to growing rates of drug abuse . the assembly considers that this demands a renewed urgency for a clear signal from the international community granting legal status to key public health responses . over the past twenty years , a wide socio - medical literature has emerged on appropriate and effective responses to drug abuse and addiction . the british institute of international and comparative law drafted a framework convention on public health promotion which has been presented to the assembly . the convention represents this scientific and medical knowledge in a transnational policy document and consolidates existing effective practices . it is designed to complement existing legal frameworks in the areas of human rights , public health and drug control . the key tenet of international law on which the convention is built , is the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health . to this end , the convention has three inter - related objectives : a. to promote the right to health in the context of drug abuse as a fundamental human right ; b. to clarify the scope of the right to health as it applies to drug abuse ; c. to help identify good practices for the operationalization of the right to health as it applies to drug abuse , at the community , national and international levels . the right to health extends across a broad range of issues and the convention is premised on the recognition that the adverse health effects of drug abuse take place at the social and environmental levels and at the level of individual and collective , physical and mental health . the convention is thus aimed at promoting the right to health in three key areas : a. individual physical and mental health � granting a clear and comprehensive legal status to public health responses highlighted above ; b. prevention and education � emphasising non - discrimination and the special needs of the marginalised and vulnerable groups in society ; c. environmental harm and alternative development � enabling substantial , real and sustained improvements in the quality of life of the inhabitants of drug - crop growing regions . accordingly , the assembly resolves to debate the convention with a view to the adoption of a recommendation to the committee of ministers , asking them to develop a recommendation to the governments of the member states or a convention establishing the criteria according to which effective public health responses to problematic drug use should be implemented . signed : flynn , paul , united kingdom , soc alay ferrer , vicen � , andorra , soc chernyshenko , igor , russia , edg correia , telmo , portugal , edg cousin , alain , france , epp / cd cox , thomas , united kingdom , soc dupraz , john , switzerland , alde fern � ndez -

known description of london . lucian is one of the few members of the monastery , apart from the abbots , that we know by name . he was almost certainly english , not norman or welsh ( british ) , and was educated in chester at the collegiate church of st. john the baptist . much of lucian 's work , undertaken in the second year of the tenure of abbot geoffrey ( 1194 - 1208 ) , is taken up with sermonising , but there are also numerous fascinating references to the abbey and city as it was at the end of the 12th century . for example : " the native of chester remembers how three roads branch off outside eastgate and how beautiful and pleasing are the names of the places to which they lead . the road straight in front straight in front leads to christ 's town ( christleton ) , that on the right to the old ford ( aldford ) but if it turns to the left it comes to a place which they rightly call the valley of demons ( hoole ) with reference to the hiding places of those who lie in wait ... the wanderer ... is despoiled by thieves and robbers " . this latter road took its origins in the roman road which ran from the fortress of deva , along the line of today 's frodsham street and brook street , through the suburb of hoole and on to frodsham and warrington . much of the route remains in use to this day- although some sections , as at the newton hollows in hoole , are now little more than footpaths . hoole heath in lucian 's day had been granted by the earls of chester as a sanctuary for criminals . in addition to their attentions , nervous travellers had also to run the risk of encountering the hound of hell - for it was believed that the hollow way along the old roman road was haunted and that hundreds of sightings of a huge , black slavering dog with " great white teeth like knives " were reported here . for this reason , the fraternity of st. anne 's set up a ' cross ' at the head of st. anne 's lakes- where the ermine public house is today . it was here that travellers stopped to pray for protection from the ' devils ' ahead . the ' cross ' was not a true cross but actually part of a medieval statue which , for some reason , " offended " a noblewoman in clwyd . the statue was put on trial , found guily and hung ! the rope , however , broke so the statue was was instead cast into the waters of the river dee where it was washed up under the walls of chester . part of it was buried in st. john 's church and the rest was set up by st. anne 's lakes where it remained until the civil war in the seventeenth century , at which point it vanished without trace . ( there are some curious similarities between parts of this story and one concerning a statue of the virgin mary which was washed up on the roodee ) readers will be relieved to know that lucian 's ' devils ' have long since been driven away and hoole is now a pleasant residential suburb where the author sits writing this , the most recent of guides to the ancient city of chester ! lucian continues , " chester has four gates , which look on the east to india , on the west to ireland , on the north to norway and on the south to wales , which is all of the island left to the britons , through their unnatural civil wars . our chester has also , by the favour of god , a rich and graceful river beneath its walls , beautiful and abounding in fish , with a harbour on its south side for ships from aquitaine , spain , ireland and germany , which by christ 's guidance and by the labour and skill of the merchants come and unload at the city bay with many goods , so that comforted in all ways by the grace of our god , we may drink wine more often and more plentifully .... here also , by the marvellous power of the creator , a most marvellous sea shore gladdens our eyes , being now water and now dry land ... on the same day and at the same place god provides both a road most suitable for travellers to use , and the deepest waters for aquatic beasts to swim in . " this refers to the roodee which at that time was completely submerged at high tide . the dee at this time was a much larger and more active river than it is today and was the chief seaport of north west england until the continued silting of the estuary made it impossible for large ships to reach chester 's quays and the bulk of international trade went to liverpool , a few miles away on the river mersey . it is fascinating to speculate that , but for this natural disaster , chester may have retained the monopoly on sea - borne trade , developing into a large modern seaport and mighty liverpool may have remained much longer as a small fishing community and may even today be attracting visitors to view its quaint ancient buildings ... " chester has two straight streets that meet in the centre and make four ... the market is in the centre whence may be seen on the east the churches of st john the forerunner , on the west st . peter the apostle , on the north st . werburgh the virgin and on the south st . michael the archangel . " referring to the patroness of the abbey , st. werburgh , he somewhat generously claims , " there is no - one among the people so simple or so foolish who does not know the etymology of her name- she is called were - burg because she is the preserver of the city ... when fire invaded the streets and destroyed everything , ( this was in 1180 ) immediately her name came into mind . she was called on and her shrine placed in the street and she answered the prayers of her petitioners . " presumably this means that the abbey and its precincts were not damaged by the flames . it would seem that the prayers of the unfortunate townsfolk did not , unfortunately , carry quite as much influence ... lucian sternly admonishes his fellow cestrians : " but you , the most delightful of cities , heedlessness lies heavy in your eyes . commonly you run to behold the savagery of hounds , the ferocity with which they tear the flesh of bulls , the limbs of bears . only a few years ago , you leapt up and rushed outside the walls , people of all ages and both sexes and of every walk of life , so that scarcely one old woman remained , to watch two men armed to the teeth and on horseback fighting on a level piece of ground ... though they had no military training , yet with a reckless courage they made sport that was no sport , and for the ready cheers of the crowd of spectators they fought , spurring hard with their hearts on fire . and then the engishman prevailed as you willed him to do and pursued and pressed hard on his adversary ... " again referring to the townspeople : " for they seem affable in company , cheerful at meals , liberal in hospitality , quick - tempered , glib tongued , merciful to the afflicted , compassionate to the poor , not double - dealing , not grossly gluttonous , not knowing what hard work means , often borrowing other people 's property without leave ... " finally , referring to his fellow monks , lucian really goes to town : " the visitor meets with a cheery and kindly welcome and with joyful and affectionate looks . food is put before him and a place at table is freely granted him with befitting graciousness . in their ( the monks ) characters are found simplicity , sincerity and refinement ; in their manners orderliness , calm and self - control . their goodness , as if emanating from the atmosphere of the place , should refresh every human mind . just as we praise well - trained men because they are not borne down by the weight of their arms or the pertinacity of the enemy , so we admire the monks of chester because they are not wearied by the toil of their joyful yoke . to the local people they are are cheery ; to those who come from afar they are jovial , ready to open their hearts to them . the seats about their table are worn by reason of their being well - known and frequented by strangers . seldom are they free from crowds flocking round them , and in all this do they follow the example of their king - if much has been given you , distribute it liberally ; if little , this also impart cheerfully .

' - fitzgerald , strand magazine , 1896 the 28-inch refractor at the rog repro id c7817 � nmm london the 28-inch greenwich refracting telescope is the largest of its kind in the uk and the seventh largest in the world . completed in 1893 as a replacement for the 12 � -inch merz that originally occupied its position , it was commissioned in 1885 by william christie , astronomer royal between 1881 and 1911 . it was designed to keep the royal observatory at the forefront of contemporary astronomy and more active in the growing disciplines of astrophysics and photography . the job of constructing the telescope was given to howard grubb , an irish optical manufacturer who was then the world leader in the field . although the telescope was removed from greenwich to herstmonceaux in 1957 , it was used for research into double star systems throughout its working life until its retirement in the late 1960s . it was returned to greenwich in 1971 , and has become a central part of educational programmes at the royal observatory . with the recent addition of a computer - aided guidance system and ccd camera , it continues to work as an excellent visual aid to observing the night sky . the 28-inch lens ' ... the finest pair of discs of their size which have ever been made . ' - h. grubb the south - east dome with the shutter open , c.1897 repro id b304 � nmm london it is ironic that the one part of the telescope the visitor never sees is the most important . the 28-inch lens , recessed inside the telescope tube , was rarely seen even by those who used it . yet this invisible component was so difficult to make that there were only two glassmakers in the world capable of producing it ; the chance brothers in birmingham and charles feil in paris . such were the problems involved that delivery time was estimated in years . the 28-inch lens was to be of revolutionary design , allowing the telescope to perform as an observational and photographic instrument - which normally required two telescopes . with the help of the mathematician george gabriel stokes - a friend of both the astronomer royal and howard grubb - a lens was designed which was capable of being reversed and repositioned within the telescope tube , according to the type of observation being undertaken . this repositioning would achieve the necessary optical corrections . however , although stokes 's theory was sound , it proved flawed in practice . after detailed testing showed this to be the case , the proposed role of the 28-inch telescope was changed to double star measurement and over the next 70 years it completed many successful observation programmes . in 1896 , howard grubb mounted a 26-inch refractor at the observatory , specifically designed for photographic observations . the job of casting the lens was given to the chance brothers of birmingham and late in 1888 , almost three and a half years and 15 individual casting failures later , the blanks were ready for polishing and finishing . although it is usually referred to as one lens there are in fact two separate elements ; the crown and the flint . when chance finally delivered the unfinished blanks they were received with great enthusiasm by howard grubb , who said they were ' the finest pair of discs of their size which have ever been made ' . the polishing process went through several stages . first , the very rough surface irregularities were taken off with the abrasive combination of sand and water . then progressively fine emery was applied to the emerging lens . next , a long series of polishes with jewellers ' rouge almost completed the surface . finally , perhaps the most critical stage began , as grubb himself completed the ' local touching ' , taking into account any small irregularities . by this stage the glass was being painstakingly monitored , inch by inch , under a microscope . in between each of the polishing stages it also underwent a continuous and rigorous series of tests , numbering in thousands by the time the lens was ready for use . the completed lens , weighing 200lbs , was finally put into position in 1893 , over eight years after it was originally commissioned the mount ' the great stability of the english form of mounting , therefore , commended it very highly to airy , and he designed the great northumberland equatorial of the cambridge observatory on that plan , as well as one for the liverpool observatory at bidston , and in 1858 the s .- e. equatorial at greenwich . ' - e. walter maunder , the royal observatory greenwich - a glance at its history and work ( 1900 ) the 12 � -inch merz - illustration from ' the midnight sky ' by edwin dunkin ( 1891 ) the mount on which the 28-inch telescope now sits was built for an earlier instrument and predates it by over thirty years . the original instrument , the 12 � -inch merz , was originally used for planetary observations and , later , as a guide telescope to the new 26-inch thompson , housed in the new physical building in the late 1890s . its design is similar to that of the northumberland telescope at the cambridge observatory . this is no coincidence as both were designed by the then astronomer royal , george biddell airy . the mount is an ' english equatorial ' type , with the telescope mounted on an axis which is tilted so as to be parallel to the earth 's axis of rotation . the telescope can then follow a star from east to west across the sky merely by rotating the mount . the telescope 's clock drive , in the base of the mount , moves the telescope at the same rate as the rotation of the earth , keeping it fixed on the same celestial coordinates - a valuable asset when long observations are required . the original clock drive was powered by falling water and was prone to freezing in the winter months . a more reliable electric drive was installed early in the 20th century . the design of the mount allows the telescope to be moved to almost any postion in the sky . the shape of the telescope dome prevents the telescope from observing below about 20 degrees above the horizon , while the north pier of the mount obscures the region of the sky around the north celestial pole . the telescope ' as regards the need for a large refractor , i have the honour to invite the attention of their lordships to ... the enclosed report to the board of visitors and to the accompanying list of large refractor telescopes , from which it appears that there are no less than 30 at national or private observatories which are larger than that at the royal observatory greenwich , six of them being more than twice the diameter ... ' - christie , letter to the admiralty , 17 june 1885 the 28-inch telescope and mount returning to the rog in october 1971 image courtesy of patrick moore the telescope tube is over 28 feet long and passes between the central spokes of the mount . the mount was not originally intended for such a large telescope , however , and it was necessary to taper the middle section of the tube in order to attach it . this is why the telescope has the curious characteristic of being round at each end but rectangular in the middle . attached to the outside of the tube are a variety of smaller telescopes . several of them were used as wide - angle guide scopes . since the field of view would have been too narrow to find an object easily with the main telescope , these were first used to target an object . others were used to read the scales on the telescope itself . by magnifying the scales on the axes of the telescope , errors were greatly reduced when positioning it for observation . the whole telescope is very finely balanced , using a series of counterweights which are added and removed , depending on the equipment being used on the eyepiece . in addition , some of the tubes of the mount itself are filled with lead shot . since an equatorial telescope is necessarily used in a variety of positions , precise balance and easy manoeverability are essential , particularly for an instrument of this size . the onion dome ' this dome - which has been likened , according to the school of aesthetics in which its critics have been severally trained , to the taj at agra , a collapsed balloon , or a mammoth spanish onion - houses the largest refractor in england , the ' south - east equatorial ' of twenty - eight inches aperture . ' - e. walter maunder , the royal observatory greenwich - a glance at its history and work ( 1900 ) the ' onion dome ' open at twilight for observing repro id d3155 � nmm london the dome built in 1859 , to house the 12 � -inch merz telescope , was a flat - topped ' drum’ . this was a wooden structure , with an opening from the centre of the roof to the edge and down to floor level . since the telescope could be used in almost any direction , the dome needed to rotate and did so by being mounted on cannonballs , which acted as ball - bearings . this mechanism was prone to problems and was scrapped when the 28-inch was installed . the new telescope , however , was over eight feet longer than its predecessor , so a innovative dome design was needed to avoid major rebuilding of the supporting brick tower . this was achieved in 1893 , in the form of the unique ' onion dome ' devised by t. cooke & sons , into which 28-inch refractor was moved in 1894 . by bulging to a maximum radius of about five feet wider than the supporting tower walls , the dome was able to enclose the telescope while using the same rotation seating as the ' drum dome’ . the cannonball bearings were replaced with a modern system . the original dome construction was a riveted iron frame covered with papier mache . it was damaged by an air raid in october 1940 , but was stripped of its covering when a v1 flying bomb fell in greenwich park on 15 july 1945 . the telescope was removed from the dome in 1947 , and the dome was dismantled in 1953 . the present dome is a fibreglass replica of the 1893 dome , installed after the 28-inch returned to greenwich in 1971 . the makers ' an increase in our optical means is required to enable us to carry out satisfactorily the determinations of proper motions of stars in the line of sight with the spectroscope , a work which peculiarly belongs to this observatory , as supplementing the determinations of proper motions from meridian observations . ' - christie , report to the board of visitors , 1885 although there were many people involved in the completion of the 28-inch telescope , just two were ultimately responsible for its design and building ; the astronomer royal , william christie , and the telescope manufacturer , howard grubb . sir william christie , kcb ( 1845–1922 ) eighth astronomer royal , 1881–1910 repro id b0718 � nmm london christie wanted to continue extending the work done at the royal observatory in the expanding fields of astrophysics and photography . in 1885 he announced plans for a large , new , 28-inch equatorial refractor , to replace the 12 � -inch merz , then 26 years old . appropriately for a instrument of this size , the 28-inch was to be of revolutionary design , allowing it to perform as an observational and photographic telescope . for optical reasons , this was usually the job of two separate instruments . the job of designing and building the telescope went to howard grubb , one of the great optical manufacturers of his age and , as a company , supplier to the royal observatory for some 50 years . since the 1830s , the grubb family had been a manufacturer of high - quality optical instruments and suppliers of some of the biggest telescopes of that time , including the vienna 36-inch - the largest in the world when it was built in 1880 . they were also renowned for their innovative techniques and attention to the smallest detail . double star observing ' this observatory should possess an equatorially mounted telescope comparable with those of other first - class observatories , so that we may no longer be prevented by deficient optical means from obtaining complete series of observations of comets and faint satellites . ' - christie , report to the board of visitors , 1885 the 28-inch telescope was originally intended to be used for visual and photographic observations . this dual role was based on theoretical work by the cambridge professor , george gabriel stokes . astronomers making observations with the 28-inch refractor , 1894 repro id b5698-c , � nmm london however , this proved to be less successful in practice than on paper . soon after the telescope was ready for use a new 26-inch refractor was commissioned purely for photographic work . from the mid-1890s , the 28-inch was used in the programme of double star observations , a field of astrophysics that had been developing rapidly in the late 19th century . double stars are stars that share a common centre of gravity and are in orbit around that centre . little was known about the nature of stars in the 19th century and the idea that they could be associated physically as well as visually was new . today it is known that at least 50 % of stars are binary stars in orbit around one another but at the beginning of the 19th century their existence was unknown . the idea was not taken seriously until 1806 by william herschel . by attaching a micrometer to a telescope , an instrument that allows fine positional measurements of celestial objects , the relative positions of stars could be measured very accurately . measurement of the orbits of binary stars allows their masses to be determined by applying newton 's law of gravitation . this is the only method by which astronomers can directly measure the masses of stars . the 28-inch was moved to herstmonceaux in 1957 , but continued to be involved in double star programmes on and off until its retirement from research in the late 1960s ._. _ _ rss feed | further reading : tales from the pie ' n ' mash | tales from the rural laptop the football does n't feature much ... ... in the kentwell world of tudors , where we 've now been for about 10 days , trying to both take part ( as usual ) and film ( not as usual !

" this does not just refer to individuals entering heaven , as we hope to do by god 's grace , but to the end of the world itself as we know it , when the victory over suffering and death that christ achieved on the cross will be openly extended to the whole of creation_nnp _ _ department of anthropology , university of durham indifference is the rejection of common humanity . it is the denial of identity , of selfhood . " ( herzfeld 1993:1 ) abstract : the way people create and justify indifference to other humans could be seen as cultural phenomenon resulting from social processes . in this paper i will argue that the study of the way this phenomenon is lived and constructed reflects not only agents ' experiences through socialization but also the construction and interpretation of these experiences , which occur through agents ' interaction with different social structures . in other words , one 's indifference depends on the diverse relationships in which the agents are involved . i will argue that the study of political parties could shed some light not only on the social production of difference that leads to indifference , but also on how this indifference is lived and experienced . to do so , i will focus my reflection on an italian party , the northern league which is stereotypically known for its aggressive political rhetoric . indifference is an interesting challenge for both anthropology as a science , which is concerned both with social change and human cross - cultural understanding , and ethnography as science which is interested in the description of the ` real ' . 1 . introduction 1.1 . after the allied victory in the second world war , terms such as equality , peace , tolerance and human rights were brought to the forefront of a worldwide public debate . they became part of a common ` global ' cross cultural heritage . all humans were symbolically recognized as having the same ` rational ' and unquestionable rights . however , as amartya sen pointed out these rights are only a political preposition , which are not yet institutionalised ( sen 1999 ) . however , they have a strong symbolic connotation that unifies all humans under the same ideological status . at least in the constitution of the united nations , all humans are ` equal ' . following this thought my departure question is : how do people represent the contradiction between what are morally considered and accepted as their ` rights ' , and the experience of living or not living them . 1.2 . in other words , if the law is equal for everyone , if every human has their ` rights ' , and if we all have a moral obligation toward ` the other ' , how can one understand the dehumanisation of ` the other ' that emerges from political rhetoric in a democratic society ? furthermore , how is it possible that in european society , supposedly one of the most prominent defenders of these values , so many questions have recently emerged , for instance , about cultural discrimination in relation to immigration and religious differences ? 1.3 . in this paper , i will focus on the study of a political party , the northern league . the northern league ( the n.l. ) is one of the actors of the recently changed italian political scenario . as a political party , it is known for basing its political discourses and stances against , for example immigrants , southerners , and more recently , muslims . 1.4 . theoretically , i will argue that political parties are potent social arenas for understanding how indifference is lived , created , and institutionalised . 1.5 . in order to make sense of this problem , i will draw my reflection from two different fields of anthropological knowledge . one the one hand , i will argue that political parties are social institutions responsible for the production of discourses that help agents to interpret the social world . on the other hand , i will focus on practice theory and the concept of habitus proposed by pierre bourdieu ( 1977 ) to understand why individuals join and choose these parties to express their political views . 1.6 . finally , this paper comes with the personal conviction that anthropology has a ` moral ' role . the social challenges presented by the presence of political discourses tend to explain the world in a rather distinctive and discriminatory way and deserves careful attention . hence , one could suggest that anthropology should try to promote inter - cultural communication , thereby helping to deconstruct and understand the roots of new doxas that allow the banalization of indifference . doing so , we will avoid way becoming a kafkian theoretical science . 1.7 . the article will be organized in three different sections . firstly , i will try to define what i mean by indifference . i will argue that indifference could be more than a word taken for granted , and that it can be perceived as an object of anthropologic study since it is dependent on a socially constructed process . secondly , i will describe the theoretical framework that i am following to address the questions posed . this will comprise two sections . on the one hand , i will reflect on political anthropology and practice theory . on the other hand , i will reflect on political parties as social institutions responsible for the rationalization and narration of the social world . then , i will focus on the northern league 's political strategies . finally , i will reflect more specifically about the nature of my proposed doctoral research , combining theory , practice and methodology and my specific ethnographic situation the northern league . 2 . part one : a theoretical problem 2.1 . how and why can political identities that celebrate the rights of individuals and small groups so often seem cruelly selective in applying those rights ? " ( herzfeld 1993:1 ) the production of indifference . 2.2 . in a very interesting work on the anthropology of institutions , michael herzfeld ( 1993 ) reflects upon the creation and institutionalisation of bureaucratic state discourses . using the weberian concept of theodicy he argues that institutional bureaucracy creates explanations for an individual 's life through the promotion of a fatalistic way of perceiving the outcome of their actions . furthermore , he argues that the institutionalisation of this rhetoric gains a taken for granted value , which implies that it becomes indifferent to the individual , since this is typified into routine categories . categories , as alfred shutz pointed out , are : " the actual way in which men in daily life interpret their own and each other 's behaviour " ( schutz : 1962 ) . notwithstanding , herzfeld does not just address the bureaucrats and the institutions they represent in power . he suggests that individuals also use the indifference of state officers to justify their own failures . in other words , this rhetoric creates and institutionalises a matrix of multiple individual fates inside the same social structure . however this indifference on the part of bureaucrats is embedded in something deeper , what he calls the roots of the western civilization ( herzfeld 1993 ) . in other words it is the way individuals are taught to see and categorize the world . 2.3 . the institutionalisation of bureaucracy is also suggested by rukmini nair ( 2002 ) as responsible for the promotion of indifference . however , in this case the study emphasises not the production of indifference , but the idea of indifference resulting from the legacy of colonialism in post - colonial india . she argues that the idea of the state , being detached from the individual through the bureaucratic system , is a direct consequence of the colonial structure of thought , which promoted an idea of state and politics based on rational premises ( nair 2002 ) . in this sense , she agrees with the main ideas of michael herzfeld . what is original in her analyses is that she points out that the major change was the imposition of new forms of narrative production . narratives and social answers , in her opinion , are not only characteristic of the rhetoric , and of the " high priests " that create , control and interpret it , but are also the way in which people ` officially ' narrate events . she observes that individuals and their own stories and accounts are excluded from these events , comprising what anthony giddens ( 1991 ) calls the sequestration of experience . in his words , " for many people , direct contact with events and situations which link the individual lifespan to broad issues of morality and finitude are rare and fleeting " ( giddens 1991:8 ) . however , the process of indifference is not just determined by an agents ' perception of the social world though pre - given categories and experiences . 2.4 . the french philosopher gilles deleuze regarded indifference as " the undifferentiated abyss , the black nothingness , the indeterminate animal in which everything is dissolved . " ( deleuze 1968:28 ) . he carries on and adds : " but also the white nothingness , the once more calm surface upon which float unconnected determinations like scattered members : a head without a neck , an arm without a shoulder , and eyes without brows " ( deleuze 1968:28 ) . 2.5 . by this statement he suggests that what is important is not how one becomes indifferent or undifferentiated , since this is the beginning of the process of difference and indifference . instead , one should aim at understanding the process of differentiation ; in other words , how things are related to each other . difference in this case emerges as a concept of social analysis , as a social process , that he suggests is remembered through repetition ( deleuze 1968:28 ) . 2.6 . deleuze draws attention to the mutual and interactive character of the indifference / difference phenomenon . the process of production of difference depends not only on routines , of the creation of a doxic world , but also of its interaction between agents , of social relationships , and recognizing the other not as category but as human being . 2.7 . in short , one could argue that the dialogue between what is different and indifferent depends on the creation of biographic relations that emerge from agent 's mutual interactions at a specific tempo . consequently , it could be perceived as a creative and transmuting social process . political parties as producers of difference . 2.8 . " understanding the social world means understanding the way in which men define their situation . " ( schutz in natanson 1962 : xxxvi ) 2.9 . given the above insights , it is clear that we can apply them to political parties as institutions that have the power to create a specific vision of the world , through the manipulation and influence in some of the prerogatives in which the social world is narrated . recalling the initial thought of schutz ( 1962 ) political parties ` contribute ' to how individuals " define their situation " . 2.10 . pierre bourdieu suggested in language and symbolic power ( 1991 ) , that the institutionalisation of political discourses are the result of not only individuals ' experiences and perspectives , but also the reflection of a historical process that the individual accesses through socialization . in his words : " the act of institution is an act of social magic that can create difference ex nihilo , or else ( as is more often the case ) by exploiting as it were pre - existing differences , like typologies , like the biological different between the sexes or in the case of an heir on the basis of primogeniture " ( bourdieu 1991:120 - 121 ) . by this bourdieu advocates something similar to what herzfeld called the roots of western civilization . 2.11 . however , as michael carrithers ( 1992:106 ) pointed out : " everyone negotiates relationships in order to negotiate meaning . " this negotiation of meaning in the case of the political parties has different dimensions . parties are competitive institutions , propaganda machines that are involved in a struggle for meaning . this representation is taken in different angles within the social world . for example , they change and reinterpret history , they use symbolism , and they dispute the interpretation of the life world . in other words , they negotiate the relationship between individuals , events , and life world . 2.12 . parties are also in a relationship with individuals , and from this relationship they also change . as renato rosaldo ( 1989 ) suggested , one should be aware of the processes of historical change that results from the interaction between agents , structure and institutions , what he called the processual analysis . this also means that the agents give different meaning to their actions in specific social settings . in his words : " ... from a processual perspective , change rather than structure becomes society 's enduring state , and time rather than space becomes its most encompassing medium " ( rosaldo , 1989:103 ) . 2.13 . in this sense , an agents ' interpretations are not just based on their own perception , or on institutional discourses or categorizations . instead , they recreate , represent , change , transform , and adapt it to their own representational experience , which means that they also define their situation by taking into account the awareness of not only the ` other ' , but also their representations toward of the ` other ' . political parties and political action 2.14 . " we must disclose the hidden agendas and instrumentalities behind the fictions of interpretative and explanatory totalization , and relate forms of knowledge to the existential contents which foreshadow them . " ( jacksson , 1996:37 ) 2.15 . the work of pierre bourdieu criticizes anthropologists ' obsession with both rules and roles , with the need of making sense of an individual 's practice through both cultural maps and decoding operations ( bourdieu 1977 ) . instead , bourdieu presents the idea of the habitus as mediator between agents ' practices and structure . in his words : 2.16 . to eliminate the need to resort to " rules " , it would be necessary to establish in each case a complete description ( ... ) of the relation between the habitus , as a socially constituted system of cognitive and motivating structures , and the socially structured situation in which the agents interests are defined , and with them the objective functions and subjective motivations of their practices . ( bourdieu 1977 : 76 ) 2.17 . in order to understand social reality , bourdieu proposes a theory of practice . ( boudieu 1977 ) . in his perspective individuals are not just actors , they are agents . they are in constant interaction with world or structure in an interactive dialogue . bourdieu conceives social action metaphorically as a game . in an interview with lamaison ( 1986 ) he stressed the need to give an account of the ` real principle ' of agents ' strategies which agents acquire through their experiences playing the game , what he calls the practical sense . therefore , instead of seeing strategy as a product of structural mechanical roles or rules , bourdieu stresses the mutable character of these strategies , since agents look to maximize and change their options through social interaction . 2.18 . the role of habitus as conceived by bourdieu highlights several relevant facts that i think would provide us with a better understanding of political action . the habitus combines agents ' experiences like education , culture , and individual motivations with a material - structural one ( political systems , history , social structure ) . it is therefore embedded in the relationship between subject and object . the concept highlights the need to go a step further in the understanding of individuals ' action through their practices . as paul roscoe argues , practice theory : " insists on incorporating nonmaterial circumstances into social process , stressing the role of individual agents in using this conditions and contingencies to create social life " ( 1993:111 ) . therefore , what contingencies led individuals to join the n.l. ? how are these contingencies related with material and non material conditions ? what is the influence of education and life experiences on the way one chooses to participate in democracy ? what does political action mean to them ? 2.19 . therefore , studying the process of social differentiation that occurs through the participation of agents in a political party could help us to understand the institutionalisation of indifference through individuals ' perceptions of it . in other words , we ought to not only see them respond to different rhetorical narrative story - types that the state , the bureaucracy and the media use , which according to the discussion above , is partially latent , but we should also give an account of how individuals make their daily choices in relation to these rhetorical strategies . as a result , we should understand the way agents interpret and transform a rhetorical understanding of difference through their social relationship with the different structures that compose the social world . in other words , we should understand how individuals learn to make sense of social relationships , and consequently how they learn to be indifferent . 3 . part two : a changing environment , a metamorphic party . the lega nord : a brief review . 3.1 . the northern league is one of the actors in the recently changed italian political scenario . as a political party , it is known for its aggressive discourses and stances against , for example immigrants , and southerners italians , immigrants and modernization . this led to its categorization as a ` right wing extremist party ' ( see for example betz 1993 and stolcke 1995 ) . another relevant feature about the n.l rhetoric is their open contestation of the idea of italy as a nation state , and its focus upon the construction and institutionalisation of a ` northern identity ' . politically , they argue for a federalist reform that would give more decision - making power to regions ( diamanti 1993 , cento bull and gilbert 2001 ) . 3.2 . according to messina , the league : " was the most significant new element in the italian political scene of the 1990s " ( 1998 463 - 464 ) . the fall of the berlin wall liberated italian voters from the ` anti - communist stigma ' and led to a major refocusing on the internal situation ( gundle and parker 1996 , ginsborg 2001 ) . during this period , italy also experienced the spread of regionalist parties . the regional parties , or the leagues , started at the beginning of the eighties in the region of veneto ( diamanti 1993 , gold 2003 ) . the venetian league strived for the recognition of both the distinctive venetian historical features as a ` nation ' and the recognition of their own dialect ( diamanti 1993 ) . they came to prominence with distinctive and explosive slogans against rome and the central government , and focused mainly on the lack of decision - making power of the regions . 3.3 . meanwhile , in the lombard region , another league was created : the lombard league . at the beginning the lombard league followed the same pattern of the venetian league stressing ethno - regionalism based on an idea of common language . however , in the case of the lombard league , the redefinition of a region as an identity - space was more complicated due the presence not only of diverse dialects , but also due to the lack of an historically common past as a ` nation ' . still the lombard league used historic symbols to support their claims . for instance the party name was inspired by the medieval lombard league that fought the german emperor frederick i in 1176 ( coleman 1996 ) . this previous lombard league was also a source of inspiration for other symbols used by the league to create an historic connection between their goals and the achievement of their predecessors . for example the caroccio , a war chariot that at that time was used in battle , is how the n.l. is currently known in the press . sometimes , this symbolism is simplified to the warrior that appears in the league symbol ( alberto giussano ) , the leader of the league in the battle of legano ( coleman 1996 ) . 3.4 . the lombard league was led by an innovative an audacious politician , umberto bossi . bossi was strongly influenced by the russeauian idea that ` true democracy ' could only be achieved in small communities ( bossi and vimercati 1992 ) . furthermore , he also opposed himself to the supposed lack of moral values of the industrial era , denouncing the substitution of traditional values for those of ` consumism ' ( bossi and vimercati 1992 ) . again , using a russeauian representational metaphor he portrayed himself as ` the noble savage ' . he stressed the fact that he grew up in a peasant family that espoused values of hard work , honour and community , contrasting this with the perverse and corrupt political class in rome and the south ( bossi and vimercati 1992 ) . 3.5 . in 1991 the regionalists movements where united under the same name , becoming the lega nord . bossi emerged as the uncontested leader of the league , and expanded the values that had been previously presented as particular of the pure lombard 's , as a general value of the ` northern people ' . following an extremely pragmatic agenda , to distance the n.l. from mainstream politics , bossi took advantage of the general discrediting of the internal political system to distance the n.l. 3.6 . modelled on rhetoric of the venetian and lombard league , the n.l. based its discourse on simple language and clear and strong slogans that osvaldo croci ( 2001 ) called the ` gentese ' . the discourses were also replete with colloquial , jargonistic and aggressive language . this rhetoric was in clear contrast with the normally extremely formal italian political discourse ( croci 2001 ) . 3.7 . the league was composed in part by young and enthusiastic militants , and found support among the small entrepreneurial community due to their platforms for less taxation and bureaucratic efficiency ( diamanti 1993 ) . the campaigns were made on a face - to - face basis , which contrasted to the more distant stance that traditional parties took . as carlos ruzza and o. schmidte ( 1993 ) described , the meeting places for the league campaigns could be anywhere , and were normally informal . places like bars , night clubs and football stadiums , were transformed through rituals into places of dissemination of the league ideals . moreover , although at the beginning the n.l. was dismissed by the media , with time , bossi and his protest movement gained an exponential projection in press coverage . 3.8 . in 1996 the n.l. changed its political stance , arguing for the total secession of the north of italy ( cento bull and gilbert 2001 ) . the ` new ' imagined nation they wanted to create was called padania . in september 1996 , the n.l. organized a ritual ceremony , and declared the ` independence and sovereignty of padania ' near the river po in the veneto region . the threat to the integrity of the italian national state was now more real . 3.9 . the league , however , abandoned the secessionist claim due to its overall lack of support . by 2001 they realigned themselves with their former coalition partners and shared government responsibility . 3.10 . however , the league also changed its rhetorical strategy . in the struggle for difference , the league 's 2001 campaign recovered old platforms , such as emphasising immigration control , and maintaining local regional power . but a new attitude was adopted towards the e.u. what initially was considered to be a successful and desirable structure was now portrayed as extremely centralized , bureaucratised and corrupt by the n.l. bossi calls the e.u. the ` soviet union of europe ' since it overtakes the decision - making powers of regions and nation - states ( giordano 2003 ) . the n.l. has also become a more conservative party . the initial neo - liberal impulses were substituted by an anti - globalization and anti - modernization discourse . globalisation and modernisation are considered to be the export of the american way of life . more recently , anti - muslim discourses and parades have emerged . 3.11 . despite the fact that the n.l. is a recent political party , its impact on the italian social scene has been strong . by highlighting the idea of a pure northern identity , based on the values of hard work and community , the n.l. has been changing the way individuals perceive other individuals . in other words , the rhetoric of the n.l emphasises and gives voice to social differences , through the construction of a set of complex categories and typologies that help to justify their indifference toward the ` other ' . theory and practice : a research proposal 3.12 . " all projecting " , dr. schutz writes , " consists in an anticipation of future conduct by way of phantasying " . in phantasying , i visualize in anticipation the action i am projecting as though it were already performed , completed " ( natanson 1962 : xxxviii ) . 3.13 . i plan to conduct fieldwork in the region of veneto . there are several reasons why i chose the veneto region . so far , the extant studies of the n.l. have drawn attention to the fact that , after 1994 , the n.l. has been having problems in gaining votes in urban environments . ( wild 1997 , giordano 1997 ) . however , in the region of veneto , the n.l. still has a considerable influence in some urban centres such as vicenza , treviso , belluno and padua . veneto is one of the richer italian regions . its economy is predominantly based on small entrepreneurs and the unemployment rate is low . this is interesting because normally the n.l opposes itself to modernity , supposedly giving voice to the victims of globalisation ( woods 1995 ) . this leads one to question why one would choose a political party that promotes this kind of rhetoric , since its normally taken for granted that anti - immigration discourse is normally strong in areas with higher rates of unemployment . 3.14 . methodologically , studies on the n.l. have focused mainly on interviews , questionnaires , and analyses of party rhetoric ( see diamanti 1993 , giordano 1997 , gilbert and cento bull 2001 gold 2003 ) . i plan to carry out fieldwork for one year . at the core of my research methods will be participant observation , interviews and life stories . although i plan to combine these research techniques with historical and media records , i will give strong emphasis to the collection of life stories of individuals ' engagement and participation in the party . life stories also give an account of how individuals construct their narrative plot and justify their actions in a specific social setting . in a sense , it allows us to go back in time and perceive the aspects which individuals consider central to their interpretation and construction of their social world ; in others words , how they represent causality . 3.15 . life stories , therefore , will shed some light on the process of the creation of ` the taken for granted ' through experience ( agency ) or socialization ( structure ) . i expect to see how individuals describe the influence of their previous political experiences , the role of family , friendship , kinship , and social environment , and how this creates an idea of naturality / morality in their options . moreover , life stories will create the possibility of seeing how people use pre - given categories about the south , immigrants , democracy , participation , family and government . recalling the thoughts of schutz , it will allow me to see how individuals represent their experiences and how they construct the typologies of difference when constructing their political narratives . as michael carrithers argued : 3.16 . story telling points to what is perhaps the most powerful human capacity , which is to understand one 's own and other moods , plans and beliefs , and the metamorphosis of those mental states , in a long flow of action ( carrithers , 1992 : 74 ) . 3.17 . individual 's accounts provided by life stories will also help to make sense of the idea of unity / community , based on an idea of common / similar experiences , since the informants may perceive certain events as important . this is in sharp contrast with the data collected in previous studies , and will allow me to understand the reasons why people choose a political party that , through its anti - democratic rhetoric within a democratic regime , contests the rights of other people . 3.18 . indifference is a mechanism of power , which is resultant of the interpretation of individual experience , and through discursive categories which neglect the individual . as a result , it is important to understand individuals ` options and how they are related to social and political structures . in other words , my proposed study will shed some light on how people create , live and justify indifference by understanding the multifaceted relationships that create and justify the social and cultural processes of differentiation . bibliography anderson , b.

( most of the pressure in the hydraulic systems covered in this manual is created by resistance to flow . ) resistance is usually caused by a restriction or obstruction in a path or flow . the pressure developed in a system has an effect on the volumetric output of the pump supplying flow to a system . as pressure increases , volumetric output decreases . this drop in output is caused by an increase in internal leakage ( slippage ) from a pump 's outlet side to its inlet side . slippage is a measure of a pump 's efficiency and usually is expressed in percent . some pumps have greater internal slippage than others ; some pumps are rated in terms of volumetric output at a given pressure . 3 - 3 . displacement . displacement is the amount of liquid transferred from a pump 's inlet to its outlet in one revolution or cycle . in a rotary pump , displacement is expressed in cubic inches per revolution and in a reciprocating pump in cubic inches per cycle . if a pump has more than one pumping chamber , its displacement is equal to the displacement of one chamber multiplied by the number of chambers . displacement is either fixed or variable . a. fixed - displacement pump . in this pump , the gpm output can be changed only by varying the drive speed . the pump can be used in an open - center system - a pump 's output has a free - flow path back to a reservoir in the neutral condition of a circuit . b. variable - displacement pump . in this pump , pumping - chamber sizes can be changed . the gpm delivery can be changed by moving the displacement control , changing the drive speed , or doing both . the pump can be used in a closed - center system - a pump continues to operate against a load in the neutral condition . 3 - 4 . slippage . slippage is oil leaking from a pressure outlet to a low - pressure area or back to an inlet . a drain passage allows leaking oil to return to an inlet or a reservoir . some slippage is designed into pumps for lubrication purposes . slippage will increase with pressure and as a pump begins to wear . oil flow through a given orifice size depends on the pressure drip . an internal leakage path is the same as an orifice . therefore , if pressure increases , more flow will occur through a leakage path and less from an outlet port . any increase in slippage is a loss of efficiency . 3 - 5 . designs . in most rotary hydraulic pumps ( figure 3 - 3 ) , the design is such that the pumping chambers increase in size at the inlet , thereby creating a vacuum . the chambers then decrease in size at the outlet to push fluid into a system . the vacuum at the inlet is used to create a pressure difference so that fluid will flow from a reservoir to a pump . however , in many systems , an inlet is charged or supercharged ; that is , a positive pressure rather than a vacuum is created by a pressurized reservoir , a head of fluid above the inlet , or even a low - pressure - charging pump . the essentials of any hydraulic pump are- a low - pressure inlet port , which carrys fluid from the reservoir . a high - pressure outlet port connected to the pressure line . pumping chamber(s ) to carry a fluid from the inlet to the outlet port . a mechanical means for activating the pumping chamber(s ) . pumps may be classified according to the specific design used to create the flow of a liquid . most hydraulic pumps are either centrifugal , rotary , or reciprocating . a. centrifugal pump . this pump generally is used where a large volume of flow is required at relatively low pressures . it can be connected in series by feeding an outlet of one pump into an inlet of another . with this arrangement , the pumps can develop flow against high pressures . a centrifugal pump is a nonpositive - displacement pump , and the two most common types are the volute and the diffuser . ( 1 ) volute pump ( figure 3 - 4 , ) . this pump has a circular pumping chamber with a central inlet port ( suction pipe ) and an outlet port . a rotating impeller is located in a pumping chamber . a chamber between the casing and the center hub is the volute . liquid enters a pumping chamber through a central inlet ( or eye ) and is trapped between the whirling impeller blades . centrifugal force throws a liquid outward at a high velocity , and a contour of a casing directs a moving liquid through an outlet port . ( 2 ) diffuser pump ( figure 3 - 5 ) . similar to a volute type , a diffuser pump has a series of stationary blades ( the diffuser ) that curve in the opposite direction from whirling impeller blades . a diffuser reduces the velocity of a liquid , decreases slippage , and increases a pump 's ability to develop flow against resistance . b. rotary pump . in this positive - displacement - type pump , a rotary motion carries a liquid from a pump 's inlet to its outlet . a rotary pump is usually classified according to the type of element that actually transmits a liquid , that is , a gear- , vane- , or piston - type rotary pump . c. reciprocating pump . a reciprocating pump depends on a reciprocating motion to transmit a liquid from a pump 's inlet to its outlet . figure 3 - 2 shows a simplified reciprocating pump . it consists of a cylinder that houses a reciprocating piston , figure 3 - 2 , 1 ; an inlet valve , figure 3 - 2 , 2 ; and an outlet valve , figure 3 - 2 , 3 , which direct fluid to and from a cylinder . when a piston moves to the left , a partial vacuum that is created draws a ball off its seat , allowing a liquid to be drawn through an inlet valve into a cylinder . when a piston moves to the right , a ball reseats and closes an inlet valve . however , the force of a flow unseats a ball , allowing a fluid to be forced out of a cylinder through an outlet valve . 3 - 6 . gear pumps . gear pumps are external , internal , or lobe types . a. external . figure 3 - 6 shows the operating principle of an external gear pump . it consists of a driving gear and a driven gear enclosed in a closely fitted housing . the gears rotate in opposite directions and mesh at a point in the housing between the inlet and outlet ports . both sets of teeth project outward from the center of the gears . as the teeth of the two gears separate , a partial vacuum forms and draws liquid through an inlet port into chamber a. liquid in chamber a is trapped between the teeth of the two gears and the housing so that it is carried through two separate paths around to chamber b. as the teeth again mesh , they produce a force that drives a liquid through an outlet port . b. internal . figure 3 - 7 shows an internal gear pump . the teeth of one gear project outward , while the teeth of the other gear project inward toward the center of the pump . one gear wheel stands inside the other . this type of gear can rotate , or be rotated by , a suitably constructed companion gear . an external gear is directly attached to the drive shaft of a pump and is placed off - center in relation to an internal gear . the two gears mesh on one side of a pump chamber , between an inlet and the discharge . on the opposite side of the chamber , a crescent - shaped form stands in the space between the two gears to provide a close tolerance . the rotation of the internal gear by a shaft causes the external gear to rotate , since the two are in mesh . everything in the chamber rotates except the crescent , causing a liquid to be trapped in the gear spaces as they pass the crescent . liquid is carried from an inlet to the discharge , where it is forced out of a pump by the gears meshing . as liquid is carried away from an inlet side of a pump , the pressure is diminished , and liquid is forced in from the supply source . the size of the crescent that separates the internal and external gears determines the volume delivery of this pump . a small crescent allows more volume of a liquid per revolution than a larger crescent . c. lobe . figure 3 - 8 shows a lobe pump . it differs from other gear pumps because it uses lobed elements instead of gears . the element drive also differs in a lobe pump . in a gear pump , one gear drives the other . in a lobe pump , both elements are driven through suitable external gearing . 3 - 7 . vane pumps . in a vane - type pump , a slotted rotor splined to a drive shaft rotates between closely fitted side plates that are inside of an elliptical- or circular - shaped ring . polished , hardened vanes slide in and out of the rotor slots and follow the ring contour by centrifugal force . pumping chambers are formed between succeeding vanes , carrying oil from the inlet to the outlet . a partial vacuum is created at the inlet as the space between vanes increases . the oil is squeezed out at the outlet as the pumping chamber 's size decreases . because the normal wear points in a vane pump are the vane tips and a ring 's surface , the vanes and ring are specially hardened and ground . a vane pump is the only design that has automatic wear compensation built in . as wear occurs , the vanes simply slide farther out of the rotor slots and continue to follow a ring 's contour . thus efficiency remains high throughout the life of the pump . a. characteristics . displacement of a vane - type pump depends on the width of the ring and rotor and the throw of the cam ring . interchangeable rings are designed so a basic pump converts to several displacements . balanced design vane pumps all are fixed displacement . an unbalanced design can be built in either a fixed- or variable - displacement pump . vane pumps have good efficiency and durability if operated in a clean system using the correct oil . they cover the low to medium - high pressure , capacity , and speed ranges . package size in relation to output is small . a vane pump is generally quiet , but will whine at high speeds . b. unbalanced vane pumps . in the unbalanced design , ( figure 3 - 9 ) , a cam ring 's shape is a true circle that is on a different centerline from a rotor 's . pump displacement depends on how far a rotor and ring are eccentric . the advantage of a true - circle ring is that control can be applied to vary the eccentricity and thus vary the displacement . a disadvantage is that an unbalanced pressure at the outlet is effective against a small area of the rotor 's edge , imposing side loads on the shaft . thus there is a limit on a pump 's size unless very large hearings and heavy supports are used . c. balanced vane pumps . in the balanced design ( figure 3 - 10 ) , a pump has a stationary , elliptical cam ring and two sets of internal ports . a pumping chamber is formed between any two vanes twice in each revolution . the two inlets and outlets are 180 degrees apart . back pressures against the edges of a rotor cancel each other . recent design improvements that allow high operating speeds and pressures have made this pump the most universal in the mobile - equipment field . d. double pumps . vane - type double pumps ( figure 3 - 11 ) consist of two separate pumping devices . each is contained in its own respective housing , mounted in tandem , and driven by a common shaft . each pump also has its own inlet and outlet ports , which may be combined by using manifolds or piping . design variations are available in which both cartridges are contained within one body . an additional pump is sometimes attached to the head end to supply auxiliary flow requirements . double pumps may be used to provide fluid flow for two separate circuits or combined for flow requirements for a single circuit . combining pump deliveries does not alter the maximum pressure rating of either cartridge . separate circuits require separate pressure controls to limit maximum pressure in each circuit . figure 3 - 12 , shows an installation in which double pumps are used to provide fluid flow for operation of a cylinder in rapid advance and feed . in circuit b , two relief valves are used to control pumping operation . in circuit a , one relief valve and one unloading valve are used to control pumping operations . in both circuits , the deliveries of the pump cartridges are combined after passing through the valves . this combined flow is directed to a four - way valve and to the rest of the circuit . in circuit b , an upper relief valve is vented when a cylinder rod reaches and trips a pilot valve . a vented relief valve directs the delivery of a shaft - end pump cartridge freely back to a tank . another relief valve controls the maximum pressure of a circuit . an unloading valve and a relief valve in circuit a do the same operation . the output of both pump cartridges combines to supply fluid for a rapid advance portion of a cycle . when the output of one circuit returns to the tank , after reaching a certain point in the cycle , the other circuit completes the advance portion of a cycle . both pump outputs are then combined for rapid return . e. two - stage pumps . two - stage pumps consist of two separate pump assemblies contained in one housing . the pump assemblies are connected so that flow from the outlet of one is directed internally to the inlet of the other . single inlet and outlet ports are used for system connections . in construction , the pumps consist of separate pumping cartridges driven by a common drive shaft contained in one housing . a dividing valve is used to equalize the pressure load on each stage and correct for minor flow differences from either cartridge . in operation , developing fluid flow for each cartridge is the same as for single pumps . figure 3 - 13 shows fluid flow in a vane - type , two - stage pump . oil from a reservoir enters a pump 's inlet port and passes to the outlets of the first - stage pump cartridge . ( passages in a pump 's body carry the discharge from this stage to an inlet of the second stage . ) outlet passages in the second stage direct the oil to an outlet port of the pump . passage u connects both chambers on the inlet side of a second - stage pump and assures equal pressure in both chambers . ( pressures are those that are imposed on a pump from external sources . ) a dividing valve ( see figure 3 - 13 ) consists of sliding pistons a and b. piston a is exposed to outlet pressure through passage v. piston b is exposed to the pressure between stages through passage w. the pistons respond to maintain a pressure load on a first - stage pump equal to half the outlet pressure at a second - stage pump . if the discharge from the first stage exceeds the volume that can be accepted at the second stage , a pressure rise occurs in passage w. the unbalanced force acting on piston b causes the pistons to move in such a manner that excess oil flows past piston b through passage y to the inlet chamber of a first - stage cartridge . fluid throttling across piston b in this manner maintains pressure in passage v. if the discharge from a first - stage pump is less than the volume required at a secondstage pump , a reduced pressure occurs at piston b. an unbalanced force acting on piston a causes the pistons to move so that oil flows past piston a into passages x and w to replenish a second - stage pump and correct the unbalanced condition . passages z and y provide a means for leakage around the pistons to return to the inlet chamber of a first - stage pump . pistons a and b always seek a position that equally divides the load between the two pumping units . 3 - 8 . piston pumps . piston pumps are either radial or axial . a. radial . in a radial piston pump ( figure 3 - 14 ) , the pistons are arranged like wheel spokes in a short cylindrical block . a drive shaft , which is inside a circular housing , rotates a cylinder block . the block turns on a stationary pintle that contains the inlet and outlet ports . as a cylinder block turns , centrifugal force slings the pistons , which follow a circular housing . a housing 's centerline is offset from a cylinder block 's centerline . the amount of eccentricity between the two determines a piston stroke and , therefore , a pump 's displacement . controls can be applied to change a housing 's location and thereby vary a pump 's delivery from zero to maximum . figure 3 - 15 shows a nine - piston , radial piston pump . when a pump has an uneven number of pistons , no more than one piston is completely blocked by a pintle at one time , which reduces flow pulsations . with an even number of pistons spaced around a cylinder block , two pistons could be blocked by a pintle at the same time . if this happens , three pistons would discharge at one time and four at another time , and pulsations would occur in the flow . a pintle , a cylinder block , the pistons , a rotor , and a drive shaft constitute the main working parts of a pump . ( 1 ) pintle . a pintle is a round bar that serves as a stationary shaft around which a cylinder block turns . a pintle shaft ( figure 3 - 16 ) has four holes bored from one end lengthwise through part of its length . two holes serve as an intake and two as a discharge . two slots are cut in a side of the shaft so that each slot connects two of the lengthwise holes . the slots are in - line with the pistons when a cylinder block is assembled on a pintle . one of these slots provides a path for a liquid to pass from the pistons to the discharge holes bored in a pintle . another slot connects the two inlet holes to the pistons when they are drawing in liquid . the discharge holes are connected through appropriate fittings to a discharge line so that a liquid can be directed into a system . the other pair of holes is connected to an inlet line . ( 2 ) cylinder block . a cylinder block ( figure 3 - 17 ) is a block of metal with a hole bored through its center to fit the pintle 's and cylinder 's holes that are bored equal distances apart around its outside edge . the cylinder 's holes connect with the hole that receives a pintle . designs differ ; some cylinders appear to be almost solid , while others have spokelike cylinders radiating out from the center . a cylinder 's and pintle 's holes are accurately machined so that liquid loss around a piston is minimal . ( 3 ) pistons . pistons are manufactured in different designs ( see figure 3 - 18 ) . diagram a shows a piston with small wheels that roll around the inside curve of a rotor . diagram b shows a piston in which a conical edge of the top bears directly against a reaction ring of the rotor . in this design , a piston goes back and forth in a cylinder while it rotates about its axis so that the top surface will wear uniformly . diagram c shows a piston attached to curved plates . the curved plates bear against and slide around the inside surface of a rotor . the pistons ' sides are accurately machined to fit the cylinders so that there is a minimum loss of liquid between the walls of a piston and cylinder . no provision is made for using piston rings to help seal against piston leakage . ( 4 ) rotors . rotor designs may differ from pump to pump . a rotor consists of a circular ring , machine finished on the inside , against which the pistons bear . a rotor rotates within a slide block , which can be shifted from side to side to control the piston 's length of stroke . a slide block has two pairs of machined surfaces on the exterior so that it can slide in tracks in the pump case . ( 5 ) drive shaft . a drive shaft is connected to a cylinder block and is driven by an outside force such as an electric motor . b. axial piston pumps . in axial piston pumps , the pistons stroke in the same direction on a cylinder block 's centerline ( axially ) . axial piston pumps may be an in - line or angle design . in capacity , piston pumps range from low to very high . pressures are as high as 5,000 psi , and drive speeds are medium to high . efficiency is high , and pumps generally have excellent durability . petroleum oil fluids are usually required . pulsations in delivery are small and of medium frequency . the pumps are quiet in operation but may have a growl or whine , depending on condition . except for in - line pumps , which are compact in size , piston pumps are heavy and bulky . ( 1 ) in - line pump . in an in - line piston pump ( figure 3 - 19 , diagram a ) , a drive shaft and cylinder block are on the same centerline . reciprocation of the pistons is caused by a swash plate that the pistons run against as a cylinder block rotates . a drive shaft turns a cylinder block , which carries the pistons around a shaft . the piston shoes slide against a swash plate and are held against it by a shoe plate . a swash plate 's angle causes the cylinders to reciprocate in their bores . at the point where a piston begins to retract , an opening in the end of a bore slides over an inlet slot in a valve plate , and oil is drawn into a bore through somewhat less than half a revolution . there is a solid area in a valve plate as a piston becomes fully retracted . as a piston begins to extend , an opening in a cylinder barrel moves over an outlet slot , and oil is forced out a pressure port . ( a ) displacement . pump displacement depends on the bore and stroke of a piston and the number of pistons . a swash plate 's angle ( figure 3 - 19 , diagram b ) determines the stroke , which can vary by changing the angle . in a fixed angle 's unit , a swash plate is stationary in the housing . in a variable unit 's , it is mounted on a yoke , which can turn on pintles . different controls can be attached to the pintles to vary pump delivery from zero to the maximum . with certain controls , the direction of flow can be reversed by swinging a yoke past center . in the center position , a swash plate is perpendicular to the cylinder 's , and there is no piston reciprocation ; no oil is pumped . ( b ) components . the major components of a typical , fixed - displacement in - line pump are the housing , a bearing - supported drive shaft , a rotating group , a shaft seal , and a valve plate . a valve plate contains an inlet and an outlet port and functions as the back cover . a rotating group consists of a cylinder block that is splined to a drive shaft , a splined spherical washer , a spring , nine pistons with shoes , a swash plate , and a shoe plate . when a group is assembled , a spring forces a cylinder block against a valve plate and a spherical washer against a shoe plate . this action holds the piston shoes against a swash plate , ensuring that the pistons will reciprocate as the cylinder turns . a swash plate is stationary in a fixed - displacement design . ( c ) operation . a variable - displacement in - line pump operates the same as a fixed angle except that a swash plate is mounted on a pivoted yoke . a yoke can be swung to change a plate angle and thus change a pump 's displacement . a yoke can be positioned manually with a screw or lever or by a compensator control , which positions a yoke automatically to maintain constant output pressure under variable flow requirements . a compensator control consists of a valve that is balanced between a spring and system pressure and a spring - loaded , yoke - actuating piston that is controlled by a valve . a pump 's compensator control thus reduces its output only to the volume required to maintain a preset pressure . maximum delivery is allowed only when pressure is less than a compensator 's setting . ( 2 ) wobble - plate in - line pump . this is a variation of an in - line piston pump . in this design , a cylinder barrel does not turn ; a plate wobbles as it turns , and the wobbling pushes the pistons in and out of the pumping chambers in a stationary cylinder barrel . in a wobble - plate pump , separate inlet and outlet check valves are required for each piston , since the pistons do not move past a port . ( 3 ) bent - axis axial piston pump . in an angle- or a bent - axis - type piston pump ( figure 3 - 20 ) , the piston rods are attached by ball joints to a drive shaft 's flange . a universal link keys a cylinder block to a shaft so that they rotate together but at an offset angle . a cylinder barrel turns against a slotted valve plate to which the ports connect . pumping action is the same as an in - line pump . the angle of offset determines a pump 's displacement , just as the swash plate 's angle determines an in - line pump 's displacement . in fixed - delivery pumps , the angle is constant . in variable models , a yoke mounted on pintles swings a cylinder block to vary displacement . flow direction can be reversed with appropriate controls . 3 - 9 . pump operation . the following paragraphs address some of the problems that could occur when a pump is operating : a. overloading . one risk of overloading is the danger of excess torque on a drive shaft . torque is circular force on an object . an increase in pressure / pump displacement will increase the torque on a shaft if pump displacement / pressure remains constant . often in a given package size , a higher gpm pump will have a lower pressure rating than a lower gpm pump . sometimes a field conversion to get more speed out of an actuator will cause a pump to be overloaded . you may need a larger pump . b. excess speed . running a pump at too high a speed causes loss of lubrication , which can cause early failure . if a needed delivery requires a higher drive speed than a pump 's rating , use a higher displacement pump . excess speed also runs a risk of damage from cavitation . c. cavitation . cavitation occurs where available fluid does not fill an existing space . it often occurs in a pump 's inlet when conditions are not right to supply enough oil to keep an inlet flooded . cavitation causes the metal in an inlet to erode and the hydraulic oil to deteriorate quicker . cavitation can occur if there is too much resistance in an inlet 's line , if a reservoir 's oil level is too far below the inlet , or if an oil 's viscosity is too high . it can also occur if there is a vacuum or even a slight positive pressure at the inlet . a badly cavitating pump has oil bubbles exploding in the void . the only way to be sure a pump is not cavitating is to check the inlet with a vacuum gauge . to prevent cavitation , keep the inlet clean and free of obstructions by using the correct length of an inlet 's line with minimum bends . another method is to charge an inlet . the easiest way to do this is to flood it by locating the reservoir above the pump 's inlet . if this is not possible and you can not create good inlet conditions , use a pressurized reservoir . you can also use an auxiliary pump to maintain a supply of oil to an inlet at low pressure . you could use a centrifugal pump , but it is more common to use a positive - displacement gear pump with a pressure - relief valve that is set to maintain the desired charging pressure . d. operating problems . pressure loss , slow operation , no delivery , and noise are common operating problems in a pump . ( 1 ) pressure loss . pressure loss means that there is a high leakage path in a system . a badly worn pump could cause pressure loss . a pump will lose its efficiency gradually . the actuator speed slows down as a pump wears . however , pressure loss is more often caused by leaks somewhere else in a system ( relief valve , cylinders , motors ) . ( 2 ) slow operation . this can be caused by a worn pump or by a partial oil leak in a system . pressure will not drop , however , if a load moves at all . therefore , hp is still being used and is being converted into heat at a leakage point . to find this point , feel the components for unusual heat . ( 3 ) no delivery . if oil is not being pumped , a pump- could be assembled incorrectly . could be driven in the wrong direction . has not been primed . the reasons for no prime are usually improper start - up , inlet restrictions , or low oil level in a reservoir . has a broken drive shaft . ( 4 ) noise . if you hear any unusual noise , shut down a pump immediately . cavitation noise is caused by a restriction in an inlet line , a dirty inlet filter , or too high a drive speed . air in a system also causes noise . air will severely damage a pump because it will not have enough lubrication . this can occur from low oil in a reservoir , a loose connection in an inlet , a leaking shaft seal , or no oil in a pump before starting . also , noise can be caused by worn or damaged parts , which will spread harmful particles through a system , causing more damage if an operation continues . sorry commercial break ! but look at these women all looking for marriage ! ! ! come on guys , how could you resist ? click on the pics you like to find out more . use the scroll buttons at the bottom to see all of them_prp _ _ most dramatic exit for grace when davina told grace she was coming to get her , grace had one parting shot left ! as she was saying goodbye to her fellow housemates she picked up a glass of water and doused susie with it .

development programme . granger claims that kbr will bring rigour to the process of managing the national programme . the company will provide granger 's team with project planning , risk analysis and management , cost modelling , procurement support , implementation and other programme - support services . a team of around 20 advisors will provide these services . although kbr is largely unknown to the nhs , it is one of the uk 's largest suppliers to government , particularly in defence and transport : it is one of the mod 's five largest contractors , responsible for operating major british naval and airforce installations . it is also a major player in global defence logistics . kbr has been involved in britain since 1959 , when it set up operations to support early exploration for north sea oil , and in major uk government contract work since the 1980s , when it took over management of the royal navy 's main uk base at devonport . kbr 's headquarters for its international operations are in leatherhead , in surrey , and the uk is its main base of operations outside the us . to single out kbr , with its 40-year history in britain , as american is absurd when almost every major it supplier to the nhs is foreign . outside britain , it is one of the world 's largest oil , defence and nuclear contractors , with a particularly close relationship with the us military . it has been a supplier to the us defense department since the 1940s . the company is the main us government contractor for managing russia 's nuclear - weapons conversion programme , under an agreement between the two countries . it is also one of the us military 's main logistics operators , a role it looks increasingly likely to replicate in the uk : a sign of the convergence in the armed forces of the two countries that the uk government is pushing through not only at strategy and operational levels , but also in logistics and procurement . controversy it is outside the uk , however , that controversy starts . for kbr is part of halliburton , the giant american oil and engineering company that has been under attack for the way it reported profits to wall street . allegations of irregularity led to the us securities exchange commission ( sec ) launching an official enquiry into the company . and the chairman of halliburton when the company then made changes to its accounting procedures was dick cheney , george h bush 's secretary for defense and george w bush 's vice - president . so the spat over how halliburton reported its profits fast became a major political row about the oil industry 's influence on the bush white house . what halliburton did was to change the way revenue from ongoing long - term projects was treated in the company 's accounts . historically , companies involved in long - term contracts had recorded revenue on a cash basis . but in the early 1980s , a movement grew to align accounts more closely to real operating costs and revenues � a trend known as � modern accountancy ' . the idea is to reflect more accurately a company 's actual trading performance over a particular period , rather than its historic position . a 1981 change to us regulations made the move legal . by the time halliburton adopted this approach , most of the us oil industry was already using it . but most of the rest of the us oil industry had n't had the controversial figure of dick cheney at their head , the man claimed to be the prime minister in george w bush 's figurehead presidency . to compound the controversy , dick cheney is still being paid by halliburton . according to the white house , these are historic payments owing to him from his time as chairman � the implication being that cheney adopted this approach to minimise his tax liability . but with kbr as a major us government contractor � a position that , incidentally , it has held since the 1940s � every new government contract draws accusations of undue political influence . kbr has also generated its own fair share of flack . the company is an astute lobbyist . its very success in winning business from the pentagon , however , has led critics of the administration to claim that it exerts undue influence . as brown and root , the company gained a reputation for political involvement in the 1960s by flying lyndon b johnson around texas in its company helicopters . both kbr and parent company halliburton are well known for courting us politicians , and for providing them with comfortable berths out of office . nor is kbr a stranger to controversy inside the uk , where it has been a leader in pfi and involved in some of the uk 's largest pfi deals . but that has made it few friends amongst those opposed on principle to pfi . the creation of a management company for the royal navy 's main base at devonport resulted in an acrimonious public campaign led by trade unions and local mp david owen in the 1980s . the company 's involvement in pfi deals for new motorways and the london underground again made it a target for campaigners . qualifiers so what does kbr bring to the table ? above all , an experience of public - sector procurement in the uk that is almost second to none . the lack of awareness of kbr , when contrasted with better - known contractors such as bae , or siemens , is testament to kbr 's success in managing some of the most contentious public - private deals quietly and effectively . that by itself is likely to recommend the company in whitehall . the other contractor with a similar public - sector experience , bae , is highly political and well known for airing its views in public . it too has endured storms � about the nimrod 2000 upgrade programme , with bae producing wings that did n't fit the aircraft , and the new carrier programme , which was awarded to french company thales , instead of bae . secondly , kbr has experience of managing very large - scale projects and the nhs it programme , although only for england , is , none the less , a very large undertaking . kbr has organised the logistics for major us military expeditions , like kosovo , albania , afghanistan and iraq . it works in some of the largest public - sector contracts in the world , including the decommissioning of much of the former soviet union 's nuclear stockpile , and the world bank - financed $ 13bn great man - made river project in north africa . independence from any likely ict suppliers is another major asset . unlike most of the obvious candidates for the role , kbr has no obvious � baggage ' in the it field . its very lack of previous involvement with either ict or the nhs bodes well for impartiality . then , the procurement model the government is applying to the health service is one developed in the 1980s by the mod. kbr understands the model inside out , has made it work , and has extended it � to the immense relief of the mod and the government . defence has always presented government with its biggest procurement headaches . the failure of the tsr-2 project was a milestone in forcing whitehall 's retreat from micro - managing very large - scale complex technical projects . but in defence , what replaced it � management by supplier with loose co - ordination by the mod � threatened to cause anarchy . the breaking point for that approach came with gec - marconi 's disastrous attempt to build the aew.3 system . as a result , the mod brought in a prime - contractor system , where a major defence contractor would be appointed the prime contractor with responsibility for project managing all aspects of very large procurements , monitored by a third - party consultancy . that , essentially , is the system the government is now applying to the npfit . the sense of a � quiet pair of hands ' , first seen with devonport , has been seen again with equally contentious public - private projects like the management of the nuclear weapons establishment at aldermaston and dbfo road - building projects . the company is also now involved with d154 , the management of the royal navy 's strategic nuclear base at devonport . with the management of both aldermaston and the trident nuclear base , kbr could n't be closer to the heart of government . nor can the company be unknown to granger . when he left university , granger worked in the oil industry , where both halliburton and kbr are predominant , and before becoming britain 's highest - paid civil servant , he worked for deloitte . projects he worked on included transport for london and the london underground , where the main engineering consultancy was kbr . william payne , freelance writer . late news on kbr just before this issue of bjhc&im ( june 2003 ) went to press we learnt that , in a strange new twist , kellogg brown & root is about to go into chapter 11 , the us equivalent to british bankruptcy . the move is a ploy to avoid paying massive indemnities to the families of victims of asbestosis . at the same time , the company is facing fresh accusations over its role in post - war iraq , the way it secures contracts from the pentagon , and admissions of tax fraud and bribery of govern � ment officials . meanwhile , parent company halliburton 's stock has defied wall street gravity , increasing by a quarter since new year . but analysts are divided over whether it 's an impend � ing settlement of long - standing legal actions , or a potential oil bonanza for kbr in the gulf that 's driving up the share price . kbr 's decision to take chapter 11 is unlikely to alter its new position within the nhs , despite standard nhs contracts threatening instant ter � mination if a company has an ad � ministrative order placed against it . the chapter 11 protection is part of a deal worked out by parent company halliburton to settle an outstanding $ 4.2bn asbestos - related lawsuit . that , some analysts and the company itself claim , is the reason for the 25 % jump in the company 's stock on wall street � the index of top 500 us firms only managed 4 % . kbr 's rivals are managing an average of only 10 % . but then these rivals are n't doing quite so well out of the us ad � ministration . declassified pentagon documents show that kbr 's contract in post - war iraq � controversially awarded in a closed no - bid deal � includes not just repairing infra � structure as originally announced , but operating the oil fields as well . the deal could be worth up to $ 7bn . then there 's the embarrassing little matter of tax evasion and bribing government officials . kbr admitted in may that it had paid millions to a nigerian government official to avoid paying taxes . the company now faces an official investigation by both us and nigerian authorities ._. _ _ how much do you really know about the great dane ? find out here . from russia with love do you know your turgenev from your tolstoy ? test your knowledge in our quiz on the russian classics . h.g. wells quiz penguin classics are publishing ten of h.g. wells 's most famous works . try our quiz about the books ( before you read or re -

at least get a discount as these items will be hard to find on their own . this voigtlander focussing brilliant has had one trip out with some success . it proved to be as easy / hard to use as a lubitel ( the ground glass dot on the focussing screen in both cameras is quite difficult to use ) and the automatic frame counter was temperamental , loosing a whole frame somewhere and leaving uneven spacing amongst the other 11 . there was also some evidence of vignetting in the corners of the photos which might indicate the voigtar lens does n't really have the coverage for the full 6x6 cm frame . overall though the following photos prove the camera is in working order and with care and practice i expect it would produce good results . these photos were taken using jessops 200 iso black and white print film . the negatives were then directly scanned using a flatbed scanner into coral photo paint 7 and turned into positives . some very helpful instructions for the non focusing brilliant v6 can be found on the marriotworld site . another good voigtlander focussing brilliant page can be found at :_: _ _ what are economic indicators ? no investment exists in isolation from the overall economy . economic indicators are data on key economic variables recorded at regular periods of time that are used to predict , identify and confirm fundamental movements in economic activity . used judiciously , the information conveyed by economic indicators can help investors to predict the likely movements of the market . the key economic indicators are : gross domestic product ( gdp ) interest rates inflation unemployment money supply you should avoid making investment decisions based solely on an interpretation of one indicator , even if this interpretation happens to be your own . the evidence suggested by one indicator is unlikely to account fully for everything that is going on in the economy . gross domestic product ( gdp ) the most significant indicator of the health of the economy is the value of the goods and services it produces . this is known as the gross domestic product , or gdp . the gdp figure is published quarterly . a stable gdp is generally regarded as good news for investors . rising gdp during a recession is a sign of economic expansion . however , rising gdp in an already strong economy will trigger inflation fears . inflation is bad news for investors because it eats away at returns . this explains why share prices often fall on news that gdp has increased . interest rates when you hear talk of the bank of england ( boe ) adjusting interest rates , it means that the boe is adjusting the rate at which it lends money to banks , known as the discount rate . usually , other interest rates - such as the rates on your credit card or a variable mortgage - will follow the boe 's adjustments , because they pass on the extra costs of borrowing to the end consumer . investors watch changes in interest rates very closely . an increase in interest rates slows down not only consumer spending , but it will also hit the future performance of companies . higher interest rates make it more expensive for firms to expand their business operations by borrowing money or issuing debt , because they will have to pay a higher interest rate on their loans . high interest rates have a secondary affect of encouraging investors to switch out of equities and into low - risk cash instruments , thereby further depressing share prices . unemployment the unemployment rate measures the number of people available for work and seeking employment . labour statistics offer a general sense of the state and direction of the economy as a whole . if unemployment is on the rise or few new jobs are being created , it is a sign that companies themselves are not expanding their businesses and the economy may be slowing down . on the other hand , tight labour markets and large - scale job creation indicate a growing , or even overheated , economy . the reaction of markets to news about unemployment can often seem paradoxical .if the economy is doing well , investors will fear that a fall in unemployment ( which you would think would be good news ) will be inflationary ( more people in work and spending money ) . very low unemployment can also be a sign of labour shortages . on the other hand , a fall in unemployment when the economy is in recession is good news for the markets as it suggests an improvement in the overall state of the economy . money supply watch out for announcements on changes in the money supply . obviously , the amount of money in the economy has a significant impact on economic activity . excessive growth in the money supply causes inflation ( the public has increased purchasing power due to the monetary injection ) , while sharp cuts in the money supply can cool off an overheating economy , or even cause a recession . if the economy is doing well , a fall in the money supply will be welcomed by the stock market , because it will probably lead to a fall in the rate of inflation . conversely , if the money supply increases when the economy is doing well , people will be worried that excess available money will increase inflation ._. _ _ sfca observations on funding for fisheries management [ this paper has been prepared by sfca and submitted to the freshwater fisheries steering group for discussion as part of the dialogue to develop proposals for new fisheries legislation and management structures for scotland . it is not claimed , however , that any or all of the bodies in the steering group share the views it contains . the paper has been agreed by the sfca executive committee and circulated directly to member clubs for comment . we are keen to get as much feedback as possible on the contents from clubs and individual coarse anglers , whether or not they are sfca members . please e - mail any comments you may have to ron.woods@ntlworld.com as soon as possible � preferably by the end of september . ] background environmental scientists and fisheries experts generally agree that a great deal more money needs to be spent on the management of freshwater fisheries in scotland to ensure they are sustainable in the long term . no - one has a comprehensive picture of what stocks or even what species most " wild " or " natural " waters contain , far less the growth and reproduction rates they achieve or how they are affected by angling pressures or factors such as acidification or nutrient run - off . over the last few years , fisheries trusts have been formed in various parts of scotland with the aim , among other things , of carrying out this kind of work . the trusts nominally cover a large part of scotland , but with their present resources they can service only a fraction of the waters in their territories . much of the trusts ' funding comes from game fishing interests , especially the salmon fishery boards , and most of their work is concerned with supporting salmonid fisheries . but coarse angling can also benefit . in the past , pike and other species have often been netted out of waters because club officials or proprietors thought they were eating all the trout , or some such nonsense . most of these people just wanted to improve their fisheries . they killed coarse fish because their members or customers demanded action ; and stocking or culling were the only kinds of management they knew . better - informed fishery managers are increasingly turning to other strategies like improving spawning habitats or eliminating sources of low - level pollution , which can often bring them much greater benefits and divert them from ill - judged and pointless barbarities against coarse species . a lot more money would be needed if comprehensive and effective information collection and management advice � whether from the trusts or any other source � is to be available for all fisheries and all species of fish throughout scotland . few would deny this would be desirable , but it can only happen if someone pays for it . who should that be ? scotland 's fisheries represent a major part of our natural heritage . they are also a social amenity and , as the recent scottish executive survey has shown , an economic asset that brings income and employment to some of the less prosperous areas of the country . it 's therefore reasonable that a substantial proportion of any investment should come from public funds . but anglers would benefit from this directly in the long term , so it is equally reasonable that we should make some contribution . there is another more fundamental reason why anglers should contribute : to buy our place at the decision - making table . in the unlikely event that the executive was to come up with all the money needed , anglers would not be the only interest group wanting a share . if we were active contributors with a stake in that funding , we would have an undeniable claim to a role in dividing up the cake . the angling and fisheries community will not be universally attracted to the idea of making a contribution . there is little or no tradition of anglers paying anything at all to fish for freshwater species in " wild " or " natural " fisheries in scotland . and where people do pay something by way of permits or club fees they expect it to fund the kind of management that has a direct and tangible effect , such as stocking , hatcheries , access , or anti - poaching measures . many of the management activities that might be desirable for the well being of natural freshwater fisheries have less visible benefits , and some are unlikely to have an immediate impact on the quality of sport . in any event , angling clubs that have put time and money into their own fisheries over many years may reject outside involvement , seeing it as interference . they may also take the view that any contribution to the funding of natural fisheries should come exclusively from those who own or use them . in addition , any comprehensive system for collecting money would inevitably have to be channelled through some form of regional or national agency . this will create a gap in the minds of anglers between what is paid and what it is used for , and an almost unavoidable perception that a substantial proportion of their money is simply supporting the administrative cost of collecting it . options for raising revenue assuming for the moment that more money does require to be raised for fisheries management , and that anglers are to make a contribution , the next question is how should that contribution be collected . there are five broad options , not all of which are mutually exclusive:- voluntary donations ; direct levies on the owners of fishing rights ; levies on the sale of fishing permits ; area permits ; rod licences . fisheries trusts currently get a significant part of their revenue from voluntary donations , some of them from anglers or angling clubs . trusts have achieved a lot on this basis , but it 's commonly agreed that the money they get does not fund all they want to do ; that a disproportionate amount of their time has to be spent fund - raising ; and that the uncertain flow of income makes it difficult to plan ahead . it could be claimed that the voluntary nature of donations has a positive impact by creating incentives to deliver what the funders want . however , this can be a mixed benefit � it may concentrate management on activities that serve the interests of the largest donors at the expense of those who have legitimate need of resources but can not contribute as much . there is every reason for bodies such as fisheries trusts to continue to encourage voluntary donations as one of several sources of support , but it is difficult to see this as a credible way of funding an all - scotland system . statutory levies on proprietors have long been the means of funding salmon fishery boards . these and other management costs can be taken into account when setting permit charges , and thus passed on to anglers . however , migratory fisheries have certain characteristics that lend themselves to this approach , while freshwater fisheries do not . any levy would require all the relevant proprietors to be identified , their fisheries evaluated to assess fair contributions , and machinery put in place to collect the revenue concerned . the cost of establishing and maintaining these arrangements would be astronomical . given that freshwater fishery rights are closely tied to land ownership , a fisheries levy would also effectively be a tax on land , which would meet strong political opposition . for freshwater fisheries , this option is simply not viable . there is an initial attraction to permit levies : the anglers who fish most ( and therefore benefit most ) would pay most . and they are potentially transparent � the money raised from a particular branch of angling or a specific fishery is readily identifiable . this approach can work where there is general support for the concept , and some quite successful examples already exist in scotland . for example , almost all the money collected by the loch awe angling improvement association goes to support the argyll fisheries trust , and on a smaller scale the tay & earn liaison committee is funded by a voluntary levy on permits sold for those waters . however , devising a fair and workable system for the whole country would pose immense practical problems . for example , it would need to accommodate both conventional permits and club membership fees that give access to fishing but also fund other club activities that would not be subject to the levy . and as with levies on fishery proprietors , there would be enormous costs and problems identifying all the relevant fisheries and collecting the revenue concerned . there is also a very high risk of avoidance where the person or body running the fishery is n't fully on board � particularly because some proprietors may prefer that their income from fishing permits is n't known to the authorities in case inland revenue gets to hear of it . in addition , intense political opposition could be expected from commercial fishery owners , who would quite reasonably see it as a tax on their business . this would be all the more unacceptable to them because it would be used to subsidise " wild " fisheries in direct competition with their own interests . again , it is impossible to see this as a tenable basis for a statutory scheme . in europe ( eg france & spain ) and north america , area permits are commonplace . a modest annual fee gives access to most of the fisheries in a state or region . private and commercial fisheries still exist to a greater or lesser extent , but they are in the minority . in scotland we have a handful of small - scale examples where a single permit allows fishing on a geographic cluster of fisheries owned by several proprietors , notably the assynt hill lochs . there may be scope to develop similar models elsewhere , particularly in respect of fisheries owned by public bodies or the crown . however , the fact that the great majority of fisheries are already privately owned and the strength of the link between riparian land and fishery ownership militate against area permits becoming the dominant � let alone universal � mode of raising revenue for fisheries management in scotland . there is no tradition of rod licences in scotland , but these are the principal means of raising funds from anglers in england & wales . the system there is universal and attracts substantial levels of compliance . in 03/04 ea is reported to have spent about � 28 m on fisheries management , of which around � 18 m gross was raised through rod licence sales . collection and compliance costs are understood to have been approximately � 4 m . the rod licence provisions currently applicable south of the border are fundamentally flawed in many ways , and are not well loved by anglers . but that does not mean the principle should be rejected out of hand . adopting rod licences would not require the wholesale importation of the e&w model . in particular , it is neither necessary nor desirable for the money raised by rod licences to be channelled through a monolithic national agency like the ea . the concept of rod licences � which could usefully be re - labelled to avoid emotive connections with the e&w model � merely implies that anglers have to pay some form of statutory charge before they can fish lawfully with rod and line in freshwater . the key factor is that the charge is separate from , and additional to , any permit fee levied for consent to fish a particular water , and applies even where the angler himself or herself is the owner of the fishing rights . risks however desirable it might be to have a new revenue stream to support fisheries management , we must also recognise that it there is a serious risk that it would become a substitute for , rather than a supplement to , existing sources of funding . at present there is substantial private expenditure on some fisheries , and considerable effort and ingenuity has gone into developing and funding initiatives such as the scientific fisheries trusts . it can be argued that this investment has emerged in response to the absence of a satisfactory national system of funding for fisheries management ; but it would be unfortunate if a national system led to a decline in private expenditure . in addition there is already an enormous input of voluntary manpower on the part of angling clubs and syndicates to run the fisheries they manage . any system to collect and disburse revenue for fisheries management similarly runs the risk that angling clubs may step back and seek to have this resource provided by others . this may be especially true where clubs find themselves expected to carry out management activities that they do not necessarily perceive to be in accord with their own immediate priorities . the way forward sfca believes that there should be substantial investment in all - scotland , all - species provision for data collection and scientific advice to inform fisheries management , and that anglers should contribute directly to supporting this facility . ideally , we would like to see the present level of voluntary donations , voluntary permit levies and area permit arrangements maintained or expanded ; but we see no viable alternative to collecting the bulk of the anglers ' contribution via an acceptable form of rod licence system underpinned by appropriate structures and safeguards . even if anglers can be persuaded that more money should be invested in fisheries management , a lot of effort will still be required to convince them that it is necessary to contribute a share of it . inducing them to pay up if and when a scheme is put in place will be even more challenging . we should not underestimate how difficult it will be to gain acceptance of the benefits and shift people 's thinking towards a long - term perspective . a great deal will depend on the structure of the system put in place . to be acceptable , any rod licence scheme must possess the following characteristics , which are presented in alphabetical rather than priority order:- accountability � anglers must have a pre - eminent place in the decisions on the disbursement of the funds concerned . this must not be restricted to arms - length advisory committees as in the ea arrangements , or rely on representations submitted in response to decisions already made . conservation � the system must under no circumstances support or promote management measures which are beneficial to one species to the detriment of another , regardless of their relative sporting or commercial value . effectiveness � the system must actually yield improvements to the quality of anglers ' sport . efficiency � the costs of collection , administration and enforcement must be maintained at the lowest possible level . flexibility � the decision - making machinery must be capable of responding to short - term or localised needs as they arise , without requiring ponderous and time - consuming deliberations or weeks or months of preparatory work and consultation . proportionality � the contributions raised from each branch of angling and each broad locality must be reflected to a reasonable degree in the distribution of expenditure to benefit them . self - containment � all the revenue raised from anglers must be used to benefit fish and fisheries ; not to support wider objectives � however laudable � by way of environmental protection . subsidiarity � decisions must as far as possible be taken at the lowest practicable point in the structure . this must go down at the very least to catchment level . transparency � anglers must be able to see what money is raised and what is being done with it . universality � the system must provide funds to support management and data collection for all parts of the country and for all species , regardless of their sporting or commercial value ._. _ _ isis press release 09/12/04 organic production works a new study shows organic production outperforms conventional in crop yield , soil fertility , pest reduction and economic return . rhea gala reports sources for this report are posted on isis members � website . details here transition to organic production increasing public demand for organic products attracts premiums for the certified organic farmer , causing hard - pressed conventional farmers to consider going organic . in the us , a 20 % annual growth rate caused sales of organic produce to reach $ 8 billion in 2001 ; and incentives to farmers to go organic are offered in the 2002 farm bill , including cost sharing , and direct payments for conservation practices , such as longer crop rotations . scientists kathleen delate of iowa state university and cynthia a. cambardella of the us department of agriculture assessed the agroecosystem performance of farms during the three - year transition it takes to switch from conventional to certified organic grain production . strategies for lowering the risk of yield loss during this period have been researched , as productivity has been found to decrease initially when fertilizer and pesticide applications are withheld . but productivity generally improves in successive years under organic management to equal that in conventional farms . the study found that organic grain crops can be successfully produced in the third year of transition and that additional economic benefits can be derived from expanded crop rotation . the experiment , lasting four years ( three years transition and first year of organic certification ) , tested the hypothesis that organic systems relying on locally derived inputs are capable of providing stable yields while maintaining soil quality and plant protection compared with conventional systems with less diverse crop rotations and greater levels of external , fossil - fuel based inputs . the experimental design involved a completely randomized four replications of four different cropping system treatments . the researchers looked at the effects of organic farming practices , including crop rotation , cover cropping , compost application , and non - chemical weed control on soil fertility , crop yield , and grain quality compared with the conventional system . they assessed pests and plant response under various crop rotations , and determined which certified organic drop rotations reduced the risks from low yield and improved soil properties and economic returns . organics performed as well or better during the four - year period , corn yield in the organic system averaged 91.8 % of conventional corn yield and soybean yield in the organic system averaged 99.6 % of conventional soybean yield . by year three , there was no significant difference between organic and conventional yields ; and both organic corn and soybeans exceeded conventional yields in the fourth year ( the first year after certification ) . in the initial year of transition , an economic advantage could be gained by planting legume hay crops or crops with a low nitrogen demand in fields with low productivity , to increase fertility for the following corn crop . in the second year , yield differences were mitigated by rotation effects and compost application , providing sufficient nutrients for the organic grain crop . the yields in year three were similar , but the importance of a soil - building cover crop , or legume grass mixture such as the oat - alfalfa mixture used in this study was apparent in the fourth year when organic corn and soybean yields out - performed the conventional crops . other benefits the researchers thought that timely weed management and sufficient levels of nitrogen , phosphate and potassium in the organic system contributed to good yields during transition . yield increases were obtained after three years because of available nitrogen due to organic amendments , such as composted pig manure and the inclusion of forage legumes and other green manures in extended crop rotations . soil fertility depends on the constant renewal of biologically available nitrogen to replenish the organic nitrogen pools for plants to absorb . total nitrogen levels showed an increase of 457 kg per hectare in organic soil over four years , or an average increase of 114 kg n per ha per annum , sufficient to maintain organic nitrogen pools in this system . total organic calcium increased 9 % in organic soil over the transition period , with no significant increase in non - organic soil . the researchers found weed pressure in the organic corn and soybean systems was manageable , and that it was less in organic soybean than in corn plots where rye was not used as a cover crop . in the soybean - rye rotation , weed densities were equivalent to conventional systems in the first two years , and significantly less in the third year . grass and broadleaf weed populations varied between the organic and conventional systems each year , but the impact on yield was considered negligible . corn borer and bean leaf beetle populations were similar between systems , again with no effect on yield . economic returns in the organic corn - soybean - oats / alfalfa and the organic corn - soybean - oats / alfalfa - alfalfa rotations were significantly greater than those in the conventional corn - soybean rotation , as organic soybean commands premium prices in the organic rotation due to increased demand . a previous study had found enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity were correlated with less dependence on inputs in the organic systems , reducing fertilizer and energy inputs by 44 % and pesticide by 97 % . the study continues this study is ongoing , and will continue to examine the effect of crop sequence and length of rotation on long - term pest disruption and attraction of beneficial insects into the organic systems . earlier work by miguel altieri at university of california , berkeley , showed that greater biological control should occur in organic systems that maintain diverse biota through minimal pesticide use ( see " agroecology vs ecoagriculture " , isis report www.i-sis.org.uk ) . potential food quality changes will also be monitored over time , so that assessments of the advantages of organic production over conventional systems can be brought more to the foreground of the debate on organic versus conventional production . as organic farmers produce high quality food without conventional inputs from agribusiness , agribusiness has a vested interest in denigrating organic systems on any account . this research is essential in countering the corporate disinformation campaign ._. _ _ i am happy to be contacted . from time to time the chocolate factory may email you with details of specials offers or news relating to the site . your email address will only be used by the chocolate factory for this form of marketing only . at no time will your address be given out or sold to third parties . if you do not wish to receive any marketing emails from the chocolate factory please untick the box provided ._. _ _ we are proud to annouce that riverside studios is the winner of the best venue award for hammersmith in the myvillage mini -

rubbish is always near the top of the list . getting rubbish off our streets , stopping the fly - tippers and clearing abandoned cars get the headlines . but that only accounts for a small part of forest hill 's rubbish problem . it is what happens next that we should be really worrying about .... most of sydenham 's rubbish goes to the huge incinerator beside the railway line north of new cross . depending on your view - this may be a good thing - 90 % is recycled into heat & electricity and metals are recovered and resold . it saves huge amounts of landfill that poisons and sterilises large areas of countryside . on the other hand the incineration plant is subsidised by being paid the ' non - fossil ' rate for its electricity when it produces the same greenhouse gas problem as fossil fuel generation . the dangers from incinerating heavy metals to produce hazardous gases are always present . while the industry claims pollution levels are within limits the jury is still out on proving these limits are acceptably safe . lewisham libdems & green parties are adamantly anti - incineration and supported the greenpeace demonstration that closed the new cross plant for four days in 2002 . another criticism is that because of the new cross incinerator our council has not focussed on other methods of recycling our rubbish and is way down the league . eu regulation is tightening up too . so lewisham , like many other councils , are in a bit of a panic to get their act in order . which may explain why we have received a press release launching : the lewisham street recycling championship this is a campaign to increase the amount of stuff we switch from our wheelie - bins to green boxes and the local recycle dumps . lewisham want you to nominate your sydenham street as a recycling champion . this is how it works : the council � s recycling team will do a survey to find out how many people currently use the kerbside recycling service in the nominated streets , or to find out how many tonnes of recycling are currently collected from the mini recycling centre in the complexes . this will be repeated three months later to measure improvements in recycling levels . the recycling team will help those taking part by providing information and a toolkit to help them make a difference . steve bullock , mayor of lewisham said : � many lewisham residents are recycling and that � s great , but we need everyone to join in . many people recycle because friends , neighbours or family members encourage them . this competition is a way of getting local people to spread the word that recycling is really important for the environment and that every person in their street or complex counts . a typical household can throw away as much as one tonne of rubbish every year . � the press release did not mention a prize for the winner - a recyclable cycle perhaps ? if you want to know more or enter your street contact beth sowden on 020 8314 2053 . resources envirocall 020 8314 7171 for green boxes or your nearest recycling centre_nn _ _ file not found the file you have requested could not be found on this server . you can go to our search page and search for the article using contributor name , reviewed author name , reviewed title or by word or phrase . click on the link below to go to the search page : http://www.lrb.co.uk/search/index.php the lrb web site has recently been updated and enlarged and many files have been moved . if you can not find the information you need using our search page , we hope you will be able to find what you are looking for by using our help page : http://www.lrb.co.uk/help/index.php . if you are still having problems , please e -

' simulink ' is an add in which is a visual ' drag and drop ' simulation package for simulating the behaviour of electrical and / or mechanical systems . the ' drag and drop ' facility for building block diagrams makes the package very easy to use . as a simple introduction we will use the software to model a single degree of freedom spring - mass - damper system , see figure 1 . the software is available in smeaton rooms 105 and 109 plus some other computer labs . under ' all programmes ' , the second alphabetical group beginning with ' m ' . when matlab has started , the prompt of two arrows pointing to the right is displayed in the right hand window . at this prompt type in : simulink then press enter . a new window opens containing a list of block types . from the ' file ' menu ( at top left of this new window ) click on ' new ' then ' model ' . an empty window appears on the right . you will drag and drop the blocks needed into this model window . 2 . building the model it is assumed that a force is being applied to the mass , initially as a step input of 1 n. 2.1 double click on the ' sources ' group block and a window containing block diagram representations of several sources appears . the ' step ' source can be recognised from its symbol . move the mouse so the cursor is over this block , press and hold down the left hand mouse button and move the mouse so the cursor and block are in the empty model window at the left hand side . 2.2 this externally applied force will be opposed by the spring force , proportional to the displacement of the mass , and the damper force which is proportional to the velocity of the mass . these opposing forces will need to be included by putting two summing points , each subtracting the appropriate opposing force , thus leaving the net force acting on the mass to go into the next element . 2.3 the summing points are in the ' math operations ' group , so double click on this group to open it , drag and drop two summing points . initially these each have two + signs in them . as the ' feedback ' forces are negative , the signs in them need to be changed from + + to + -.this is done by positioning the cursor over each block in turn , clicking the right hand mouse button and selecting summing point properties from the menu . then change the + + to + - . 2.4 to connect these together position the cursor over the right hand side of the step generator , press the left mouse button and move the cursor to the left hand side of the summing point then release the button . a link should appear as shown in the diagram , figure 2 . 2.5 the step force , less those from the spring and damper , will accelerate the mass , the net force is divided by the mass to give its acceleration . this is done by a gain block . this is in the math group . right click with the cursor over the block and select the block parameters menu item . in the box enter 1/mass value in kg . we will assume a mass of 1 kg so enter 1 . 2.6 the mass acceleration is integrated once to give its velocity and a second time to give its displacement . the integration blocks are found in the ' continuous ' group . drag and drop two of these into the model window . 2.7 the effect of the displacement has to be fed back and converted to a force by using a gain block with the gain set to the stiffness of the spring ( in n / m ) . leave as 1 initially . 2.8 the effect of the velocity has to be fed back and converted to a force by using a gain block with the gain set to the damping coefficient of the damper ( in ns / m ) . leave as 1 initially . 2.9 drag and drop two gain blocks to provide these ' feedback ' loops . the blocks have to be ' flipped ' to point to the left . with the cursor over the gain block , click the right hand mouse button and from the ' format ' heading select ' flip ' . 2.10 enter the appropriate gain values into the gain blocks - leave as 1 initially . 2.11 to connect up the feedback loops we will have to make a connection to the main line . do this by putting the cursor over the point on the line where the connection is required to start , press and hold down the ' ctrl ' key and move the cursor to the position that the line is required to run to and release the mouse button and the ctrl key . the link should appear . 2.12 to see how the displacement fluctuates , an oscilloscope will be used . oscilloscopes are in the ' sinks ' group . run a connecting link from the displacement line to the scope input . the model should now appear similar to the schematic shown in figure 2 . 3.1 run the simulation by clicking on ' simulation ' , ' start ' . double click on the scope to show its screen , then click on the binocular icon at the top of the scope screen to auto - scale the scope display . 3.2 to get a better display it may be necessary to set a specific maximum time step . from the ' simulation ' menu , click on simulation parameters ' and change the maximum time step from ' auto ' by entering 0.01 seconds . 3.3 investigate the effects of changing the spring stiffness and the damping coefficient . 3.4 to investigate the effects of a sinusoidal input , click over the step icon in the circuit and press delete . from the ' sources ' group drag in a ' sine ' source and connect it up . 3.5 to investigate the effects of a non - standard input the ' signal builder ' source must be used . having dragged and dropped this source into the model window it will need to be opened and modified to give the required signal . to do this place the cursor over the ' signal builder block ' click the right hand mouse button then click on ' open ' , from the top of the menu list . the default signal is a pulse input , this can be edited to a more complex signal by : adding new points moving points up and down moving line segments up and down these operations are done as follows : adding new points : place to cursor over the existing line at the time a specific point is wanted , press the shift key and then the left hand mouse button , a new point appears . moving points up and down : place the cursor over the point , press the left hand mouse button and move the mouse till the point is in the desired position . moving line segments up and down : put the cursor over the line segment , press the left hand mouse button and move the cursor up and down till the line is in the desired place . once the appropriate signal has been ' drawn ' , it must be ' saved ' before it will operate . david j grieve , 4th october 2004 ._. _ _ saying what we mean ... we tend to think and assume that communicating with one another is relately easy and straight forward . as christians we are especially concerned that we do not mislead people or give them the wrong impression . we do not want to make claims that are untrue or lead other into unjustifiable expectations . we try , in fact , to say only what we mean . one of the problems , however , is that we use words with insufficient regard to either or both that word 's actual meaning or the somewhat different meanings people tend to attach to it in practice . for example , to"create " strictly means to make something from nothing . only god is actually capable of doing that . nonetheless , we still refer to , say , a painter or sculptor as having " created " a work of art , when he has not . ... and meaning what we say if a retailer sold you a new bottle of mineral water , you would expect it to be full and not , say , only three - quarters full . you would expect it to be filled more or less to the stopper . in general , if we are sold something for which the claim " full " is made , we expect " full " to mean filled to its capacity . spirit filled christians ? likewise , as christians , when we speak of being " filled with the spirit " we mean that an individual is so filled by the holy spirit that there is no room for anything else . we mean that he or she is led first and last by the spirit . especially there is no room for self . when we encounter people who claim to be " spirit filled " , that is what we always observe , is it not ? is it ? or not ? well , perhaps not always . perhaps ... sometimes not . perhaps ... well , of course , perhaps we do n't really mean " filled " in a completely literal sense . what ! what of the literal interpretation of the bible ? if it says " filled " does it not mean filled as to capacity ? surely that is the intended meaning and that is what we mean when we use such a phrase . we certainly do mean that . but is it true ? now , whether it is true is quite different to whether it should be true -- and whether it should be true is something which depends on certain conditions which we do not usually state . moreover , we do not state them because generally we are not aware of them . we are not aware of them because we have not thought the whole thing through . we have not thought the whole thing through , frequently because we have accepted what other people have told us . go back to our parable of the full bottle . suppose the manufacturer is selling a product which , in some way , is subject to evaporation , even when the seal has not been broken . initially , the bottle was indeed full , right up to the stopper . but now it is less than full , perhaps significantly less than full . can this be applied to christians " filled by the spirit " ? can christians leak ? the vast majority of those who claim to be " spirit filled christian " would agree that such a filling comes as a result of what is referred to as being " baptised in the spirit " or , in some circles , as a " release of the spirit " , which is a very real , crucially important experience , and one that is missed ( often through ignorance ) by probably the great majority of christians . some christians have even gone so far as to claim , or at least tacitly to assume , that baptism in the spirit is the condition for being saved . this is not so . ( see the book on our web site [ address given below ] " salvation : faith , works or baptism in the spirit " for a deeper discussion of this ) . but the life - changing significance of baptism in the spirit can not be rejected nor doubted in the face of the extensive evidence which comes from people 's lives . moreover , it would be difficult to maintain that this experience is not associated with being " filled " by the spirit -- and that can often be taken in its literal sense . lives are completely changed,(previously worldly ) values are wholly inverted . i know that because it was my own experience . yet i have to admit that i am not a christian who is " spirit - filled " to the same degree as in those first few weeks , even months immediately following the event . certainly , there are parts of my life which have progressed and which are fundamentally different to what they used to be . but there are also aspects of my life which are not determined by the spirit in the same , virtually automatic way that was so in those early days . this must mean that i have " leaked " over this period . but if , in some respects i have " progressed " , in some sense i am now overfull ! how can that be ? only if the phrase " filled by the spirit " is untrue . or if it is a kind of metaphor for something which is much more complicated than a once - for - all bottle kind of " filling " can allow for . otherwise we find ourselves in the unsustainable position of saying that , after baptism in the spirit people can neither grow nor subsequently find that in some respects they have slipped ( without in any way having denied the lord or their conversion ) . a little reflection on one 's own life will show that either position is untenable . perhaps we can not , or even should not try to change the phrase " filled by the spirit " . but we certainly must not lead others into thinking that the change which this experience brings is either undepreciable or leaves one with no further progress to make . that initial movement of the spirit is one of profound change , but it also leaves us with the desire to be lead further and deeper into the likeness of god . 850 words author : anthony keith whitehead web site : http://www.christianword.co.uk this article is copyright but may be reproduced providing that all this information is included over twentythree years in christian healing teaching writing ministries . wide range of secular employments before being called by the lord into full time independent ministry in 1987 . with his wife iris he has ministered both in the uk and usa . has written several books on healing meditation and various aspects of spirituality . formal qualifications include : b.a. m.phil . cambridge university certificate in religious studies post grad cert in education ._. _ _ manufacturers admit to ultra mobile pc problems high price and short battery life making microsoft platform difficult to sell simon burns at computex in taipei , vnunet.com , 08 jun 2006 advertisement high prices and low battery life are key concerns for companies trying to sell handheld pcs based on microsoft 's ultra mobile pc ( umpc ) platform , staff at one of those manufacturers told vnunet.com today . taiwan - based pc and components makers asustek and ecs , together with second - tier manufacturer amtek , are among the companies showing umpcs at the computex trade show in taipei . the umpc , as specified by microsoft , is a flat , handheld device midway in size between a smartphone or pda and a notebook pc . it has a touch - sensitive screen , but no keyboard . other standard features include a version of windows xp tablet pc edition , bluetooth , an internal hard drive , and a wireless internet connection . criticism of early umpcs has focused on high prices , poor battery life , and excessive weight and heat . the same criticisms have bedevilled past attempts at similar handheld pc concepts . an amtek representative , who did not wish to be named , conceded that manufacturers are concerned . a major problem is that users are comparing umpcs with what seems to them the most similar existing product , the notebook pc . " the price is quite high if you compare it to a notebook , " the representative admitted . battery life , at two to two - and - a - half hours , is also unsatisfactory , he added . amtek 's t700 umpc should sell for around $ 800 to $ 900 . the 850 g product has a 1ghz via c7 m low - voltage cpu , 512 mb of memory , and a 800 x 480 pixel 7 in lcd display . amtek manufactures the t700 in china and sells it to overseas distributors which re - brand it as their own product . although staff would not identify any of these overseas buyers , the t700 appears to be identical to tabletkiosk 's eo which costs from $ 900 in the us . a relative unknown like amtek might appear out of its depth facing much larger competitors like samsung and asustek in the umpc market . however , staff said that amtek 's singaporean parent firm is in fact one of the world 's largest manufacturers of notebook pc chassis , with approximately 25 per cent of the market . the company therefore has the background and manufacturing know - how to succeed despite the competition , according to the company . permalink for this story | view trackbacks to this story trackback url :
