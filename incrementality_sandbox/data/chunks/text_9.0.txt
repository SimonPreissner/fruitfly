sitting in on the edges of meetings of sinn f parties the progressive unionist party reminded a bbc audience good morning ulster 27 may 1997 that the year before lord from amsterdam with brendan mcfarlane kelly had a reputation for sitting in on those meetings with the british and saying over this entailed some assumptions that few republicans would be happy with they know that not all nationalists as voting the huffy brat who owned the ball could n't be happy too for two decades the veto of violence operated go back to stormont he said it would just be orange rule again but even in a devolved government i inevitable was when republicans and others were preparing to oppose orange parades planned for routes that passed through catholic areas and riot after the police blocked the way of an orange parade from drumcree towards the catholic garvaghy road the to march through catholic areas and of residents groups to stop them was one that had the power to create who normally back the sdlp after the ruc forced an orange parade down the garvaghy road in portadown in july the explanation of the sdlp 's change of position over orange marches lies in the confrontations that took place over over the 1996 parade when the ruc gave way before orange protest at drumcree in that summer of 1996 and summer of 1996 and reversed a decision to halt the orange parade along the garvaghy road it seemed to many credibility it had established as an impartial nonsectarian force the orange order had refused the instruction from the police that to increasing disruption of public order by both sides the orange order got its way by force of numbers republicans would still do what the ulster unionist party or the orange order told it to do the credibility of this after all the next round of the quarrel between the orange order and the residents of the garvaghy road was the expectation was that the police would either confront the orange order once again but this time not give way once again they would clear the garvaghy road for an orange parade in which case the disaffection of catholics from agreement between the residents of the garvaghy road and the orange order it failed to do this and its integrity been seeking all along to find some way of getting orange feet onto the garvaghy road what had not been decision on the merits of the contending claims of the orange order and the residents group that was to be points of principle separating the garvaghy road residents and the orange order left open the question of which party had danger of unprecedented street violence faced with that prospect the orange order withdrew its ormeau road parade and three others from its greatest threat not by government but by the orange order which had realised that the cost of standing unanimous consensus in favour of blocking the next day 's orange parade two years later in areas where compromise was electorate and had very substantial majorities in some areas the orange decision not to negotiate with people who were members members and their communities but from the party itself the orange order and other sceptics were sure that the opposition role of the protest not as a challenge to the orange order but as a challenge to the state to not go along with this plan to block roads against orange parades on rte radio on the friday morning before roads against orange parades on rte radio on the friday morning before the 1997 drumcree parade catholics interviewed in the of but neither the garvaghy road residents coalition nor the orange order would concede significant ground a long delay in shoving protesters off the road would mean simply that the orange order still had the power to summon the full the jesuits had been that a peaceful way of stopping orange parades through their area was possible it was n't republicans did not invent the division between catholics and the orange order and they had stayed out of this quarrel this quarrel for decades catholics had learned to live with orange parades that may have entailed a denial of their parades for it to be worthwhile they sensed that the orange order was too big and too strong i remember and too strong i remember as a child watching an orange parade through belfast city centre two young soldiers stood ordered them to stand to attention and they did the orange order had seemed to be in charge of more drumcree parade go ahead paradoxically the effect of favouring the orange order was to put an onus on unionists to behave themselves and to accept later restraints by winning the orange order was losing as soon as the members of order was losing as soon as the members of the orange order set one foot on the garvaghy road it they could not provide enough protection for the parades the orange order had had one very strong hand to play is precisely what it intended to do the police advised orange leaders that loss of life on a large scale the garvaghy road and winning the government 's cooperation the orange order had thrown away a potential moral advantage afterwards on the future of northern ireland a conspiracy against the orange order might have just failed but the real untenability might have just failed but the real untenability of the orange position remained clear perhaps clearer furthermore it was not position remained clear perhaps clearer furthermore it was not the orange order that had confronted the supposed republican conspiracy to for republicans to have responded to circumstances in which the orange order had discarded a moral point would have been their own side a government in disapproving form with the orange order and owed a favour would have perhaps have the lessons of the garvaghy road crisis were revolutionary the orange order found that its only weapon when threatened was a veto on change but the stand down of the orange order indicated that a nationalist veto functioned too the posed by nationalists and weighed in the balance against the orange order was that the ira campaign already resumed in have to present itself as negotiable the threat outweighing the orange threat would have to be seen as dependent on reformist rather than revolutionary sinn f in 's campaign against orange parades was arguably part of a new strategy away of a nationalist community veto they showed that whereas the orange order had power to dictate its will that power seek a response to it but the talks would not stop republicans might come under serious pressure to begin disarming too much of the ira in demanding that they simply stop their campaign that amounts to asking them to stand of august 1969 as the price of getting them to stop now but that entails a lie that is offensive and their critics the provisionals if they really want to stop are caught in two ways they have to reconcile of constitutional reform it does not include the idea that orange men should be confronted at drumcree over their right is no similar challenge to nationalists other than that they stop the violence nor is there any clear shared sense want the union and the border and they want to stop the growth of the nationalist advantage over
