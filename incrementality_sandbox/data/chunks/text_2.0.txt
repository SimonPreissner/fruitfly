the by many sections of society the volunteers the freemasons the orange order the ribbonmen the catholic church the tenants right indicate some of the ways in which others beyond the orange tradition have used parades as part of their cultural ruc were beginning to take a tougher line on some orange parades these changes were reflected both in new public 1987 and then a series of high profile disputes over orange parades that culminated in further legislation introduced in 1997 held along the antrim coast in 1979 loyalists tried to stop hibernians coming over from scotland and there were disturbances through 1985 and 1986 when there were major disputes over orange parades in portadown and the signing of the anglo these incidents with the role the ruc played in facilitating orange parades in the tunnel every july it was not there developed a more concerted effort by local nationalists to stop some of the orange parades bryan fraser and dunn concerted effort by local nationalists to stop some of the orange parades bryan fraser and dunn 1995 the portadown dispute paraded during the evening in 16.8.1986 bnl 16.8.1986 as with orange parades the involvement of independent bands in hibernian parades relatively minor when compared to those arising out of both orange and republican parades senior members of the aoh have northern ireland william whitelaw seemed keen not to have to stop the commemorations a spokesman for the six county republican as long as their parades were unhindered they would respect orange parades in 1.4.1972 and the police appear not

and apprentice boys parades bryan fraser and dunn 1995:21 significant well of resentment towards the loyal orders particularly the orange order within the nationalist community the role of the orange order within the nationalist community the role of the orange institution in the stormont regime and within the police even though one could make a reasonable argument that the orange order wields considerably less power than it used to power than it used to ironically or perhaps significantly many orange parades have become more overtly sectarian and assertive some tension had existed between groups and individuals opposed to the orange parades that is not to say there are still lost much of its political power and has fragmented the orange order has seen an overall reduction in its membership the formation of organisations such as the ribbonmen and the orange order in terms of being forms of communal deterrence realities of local communal strength and more likely to defend orange interests they would act to limit political expression if tenant rights movement utilised large meetings in its campaign the orange order grew rapidly through the 1880s and 1890s and ancient order of hibernians could organise similarly large meetings the orange order in particular had drawn in more members of rural landed classes and with the franchise extended mps used orange demonstrations to display themselves to their electorate demonstrations and stormont government the northern ireland civil service british government the orange order the ruc and various class factions within the the home affairs minister and the ruc felt that some orange parades had become too assertive and transgressed communal boundaries can begin to understand why there are no longer any orange parades in the falls area of belfast or why falls area of belfast or why in 1997 no traditional orange parades went down the ormeau road or through dunloy that parades in northern ireland are simply about communal power orange parades are not simply a manifestation of croppies lie the principles that william johnston espoused during the disputes over orange parades on the longstone

order on parade published recently by the grand orange lodge of ireland education committee the sense of tradition for the loyal orders and for parading at present the orange institution retains its institutional link to the ulster unionist link to the ulster unionist party the head of the orange and black institutions are high profile members of the ulster unionist party and westminster mps yet many in the orange institution support other political parties and have become increasingly become increasingly disenchanted with the leadership offered by the grand orange lodge in terms of parading this has revealed itself local identity and local independence are powerfully present within the orange institution and if the association of senior members with two provide ample evidence of this those members of the orange institution from outside the portadown area who were involved crowd control was ian paisley who is neither in the orange institution nor from portadown paisley was able to legitimise orangeman that their parade is just one of 2,500 other orange parades because it is their parade which is politically tensions between the bands and the loyal orders particularly the orange

orange lodge and an orange parade a situation which the local district orange lodge has been happy to accept there are also a situation which the local district orange lodge has been happy to accept there are also differences between the loyal likely to avoid controversy by re routing parades than the orange and the apprentice boys the black is seen by politics perhaps leaning towards that of the dup unlike the orange institution they have no formal links with the uup and the loyal orders each parade is just one more orange march but to those taking part each parade holds one member of a residents group explained the resentment to orange parades simply it is about oppression continued oppression the it is about oppression continued oppression the perception that the orange institution is an instrument of oppression is drawn firstly many catholics there is little that is religious about the orange institution it celebrates and represents political victories it is it celebrates and represents political victories it is triumphalist the orange institution however is seen as more than simply symbolising from which many catholics feel alienated the connections between the orange institution and stormont governments are well documented and undeniable county down to avoid the twelfth only to find another orange parade taking place there in 1972 residents of obins portadown saw

preparing the way for yet another orange parade comparisons with events surrounding civil rights parades in that have taken place within the ruc for many nationalists orange parades are not only symbolic of past oppression but a few get involved in civil disturbances even attacks on orange halls in recent years there had been regular disturbances exactly what arrangements might be acceptable
