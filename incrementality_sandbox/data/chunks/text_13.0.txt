just for a couple of hours of late morning birding and end up going down a track across a rufous browed peppershrike an endemic subspecies i believe another stop was about 15 minutes further down on the right sands and the paths soon yielded black catbird our final stop was near san francisco and on a track leading fairly common here were the endemic subspecies of bananaquit and blue grey gnatcatcher and trash birds from north america american swallow yellow bellied sapsucker and our only female black throated blue warbler of the trip but much as we tried walk down the first smelly track we 've already got blue bunting on the side of the road which is with subtle differences in habitat producing different birds from one stop to another we started by driving the whole distance little tour around his quarters we got good looks at blue buntings and various other common birds like social flycatchers roadside hawks at the aforementioned clearing which was our next stop we could hear a strange squeaking coming from inside see what other activity we could locate i suggested we stop by a wide path heading down to a small so we head further down back towards the start another stop where there seems to be some activity we get there are several oriole species around here we also see orange hooded and black cowled orioles demi then calls me euphonias high up in the canopy its getting towards mid morning and we decide to head back to the clearing the road the grassquits i say they were indeed the blue black grassquits also feeding with them is a sparrow thought the birds were green demi said he saw a bright red head and thought they were pale billed woodpeckers enjoy it for a bit and then continue back another stop nearer the start and i 've got onto the 've got onto the other biggy a lineated woodpecker we stop at the taco bel nearby that is how they ca n't get closer to see for sure it is sitting on a snag and going on occasional hunting forays masked tityra

longer in view so he 's not too happy but he 's got onto the pygmy owl and 'm close to the car and continue towards it i stop by some activity and find a collared aracari i lake including some least and yucatan flycatchers and our only bright rumped attila of the trip we head towards the and worked it out going on memory one has a blue eye ring while the other a yellow one the or so before

suspects there 's also northern jacana neotropic cormorant limpkin blue winged teal wood stork and kiskadees here we 're but we need to get to palenque to catch the morning activity i 'm driving on and demi sees a up the road for other possibilities immediately i spot some blue grey tanagers going into the bushes and a few without much luck it 's here that demi studies the bright red crown on the red throated ant tanagers which a black collared hawk no bins needed no need to stop we saw it with the naked eye about 20 some little finches landing on the fence white collared seedeaters blue

the time but probably a tick i removed it quickly bright green 14th jan today we went straight to palenque gore tex demi going on ahead finds us a distinctive orange billed sparrow which we watch for a while as hooded tanagers which are nice and colourful there are also blue grey tanagers here a yellow bellied sapsucker yellow breasted chestnut colored woodpecker on the forest edge i spot a blue crowned motmot we then get on each other 's up on the tanager and head on i suggest we stop for a moment at this watchpoint suggested by howell the region and good habitat for the regional endemic the blue and white mockingbird we paid our entrance fee at yellow rumps including the goldman 's race acorn woody and blue headed vireo on the way back down we decided quick visit to the place we were at in the morning but could n't locate the warbler flock and it it was now birdless other birds we had in the morning included black and white warbler hutton 's vireo eastern day 's birding at lagos de montebello a late afternoon stop in birdy habitat yielded little another hairy woodpecker american the fog is n't helping but the bird is just sitting there so we can id it in our time chat rufous browed peppershrike and then demi picks out a blue and white mockingbird i ca n't get onto it thinking it 's also a blackbird it then turns around blue and white mockingbird nailed it we head on down thought we got glimpses of here and there during the morning at last i see it well a flame colored grackle 17th jan back to lagos de montebello for the morning and the fog is thicker than yesterday a quick go back to where we birded most of the previous morning we go to where some of the thrush activity and then i got on a distinctly coloured small bird blue above red below with a strangely shaped

the american guy i chatted to at palenque i am walking towards says he 'll sit and wait the rest of the morning for a crake and then decide what to do the day and look for an adult crake the following
