may know gun case and about remarks that have been made this morning i am going to say to you right at that the allegations that were made by clare short this morning are true simply understand i am not going to for people to have done so as was happening this morning question wo n't some people conclude that you are the moment i start answering those questions you ca n't stop that 's a discussion that could go on literally illegal under international law prime minister but let me just stop you right there because what you are doing is i really do regard what clare short has said this morning as totally irresponsible and entirely consistent question on that to do with that but you are not going to stop people speculating on it and the point about the 17 november and actually i looked at that again this morning since i thought i might be asked on it in the doyle said that it is now time to stop pandering to the ira and their political representatives prime out acts of terrorism it has just all got to stop and their choice is perfectly simple question so if minister i just spoke briefly to the foreign secretary this morning i think he did speak to the foreign secretary say whether you regard kofi annan as the kind of guy who is honest with you do you trust him you trust him surely he is not the kind of guy we ought to be bugging if he is saying she has said the things that she has said this morning but she must know and i think everyone knows lords question bearing in mind everything you have said this morning about the way that the lives of our security as far as we can see from your words this morning prime minister well in respect of the first well and why prime minister we have had them all this morning no no i ca n't answer that really i

corruption to have accountability is to involve parliament uk prime minister london tuesday 25 may 2004 prime minister good morning everyone before i take your questions and i recognise the easier it is for us to leave question this morning you met the iraqi defence minister and he has along the way because these people who are trying to stop us rebuilding iraq and trying to stop ordinary iraqis are trying to stop us rebuilding iraq and trying to stop ordinary iraqis rebuilding iraq are very determined to do can see question geoff hoon the defence secretary said this morning that the decision to send more british troops had you have already got reactions from france and germany this morning which are basically positive and in the right direction are highlighted the fact is that the people trying to stop this process working are people who are assassinating aid to be even more difficult now that you said this morning that british troops will be under the full political their tour ends at the end of june are you happy for them to go home or have you had the iraqi defence minister was saying to me earlier this morning i actually met him too incidentally and had a resistance fighters what they are trying to do is to stop the iraqi people get a proper democratic government and bank of england says it is not its job to stop the housing boom becoming a bust prime minister it office it was something like 17p question richard pearle this morning said it was a grave error to let the the west and so on and they are trying to stop us and they are literally prepared they have got better and hope literally by intimidation and terrorism they can stop the progress that is what they are trying to got no option in those circumstances but to try to stop them and there was always going to be a what is happening is that these militia who want to stop democracy or these outside terrorists who have actually got make that country better and these people are trying to stop us and in the end i think that 's he asked when the amount that they are going to stop paying him that others should not be paid as it is clear they are doing everything they can to stop the terrorism and therefore there is no reason for back of that can we say that if iraq does stop burning that north korea is the place where you thatcher did to the miners perhaps in italy we can stop him yet comrade

also i took part in the trial testing of what they really want to do these people is to stop the elections going ahead why because they know if iraqi election and the reason these people are trying to stop us is that they do n't want the elections there are areas david blunkett was talking about them this morning for example by opting in to what is called question you have been sounding quite tough
